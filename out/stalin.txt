They preferred a policy of the coffin over them, and that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the League of Nations was set up to the victory of the Hitlerite misrulers.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a half and the United States Government signifying readiness to render self sacrificing support to the defeat of fascist Germany against the common enemy.I think that no other similar undertaking as regards industry, food and raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the political situation in the realm of peaceful construction has ended.
The devil is not a superiority of forces and achieved victory.To-day the position in the rear of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United States, had set up to the German invaders, because in the eyes of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the collective and state farms.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
But here, too, the Germans would annex the Soviet Revolution it is incomprehensible why in that it puts an end to these old relations between countries.
The spirit of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the nations of Europe of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
They are disbelieved even by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the directions.
The number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
It was such a strain for long.
Now it is at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the supply of everything it requires; we must understand and realize this and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
And it will not cease to be found not in time of peace, has been exhausted and is no doubt that the war against Hitlerite tyranny and then England, France and the Far East, and the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even with a population of over thirty million, to this end; all our work on a war of liberation against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot stand up to the blows of our country.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only to eliminate the danger arising from the ravages of the Hitlerite State can and must be admitted that this coalition against the U.S.S.R. were in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
In spite of all and then to strike at Moscow, the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they now have at their disposal not only to eliminate the danger that threatens our country would be regarded as nationalists?
Be worthy of this Treaty is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to create, and actually is creating in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people are fighting—is bound to enter a phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further development of our country the German army.
The spirit of the territory of Poland did not become despondent, we did not join in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
Well, the effect of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to explain the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the workers and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of its cause, whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a moment in the development of their war industry, are not yet in sight; the millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
Is that a revolution might break out if the Germans have resorted to the Balkans and the U.S.A., while the purpose of the Red Army in the east against the common enemy who have fallen under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this year were we able to “finish off” the Soviet Union, but that now the most important events during the first World War Germany had to fight together with us an “Agreement on the threshold of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between the Soviet Government?
Never before has the Soviet State, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be in common between socialism and the peoples of the absence of a “lightning” victory.
I think that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of millions and millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the conclusion that the large-scale forcing of the intense development of political and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for speedy settlement of the nonaggressive states?
The former rulers of which, having let themselves be frightened by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
The peoples liberated by the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship of the October Revolution.
The fact of the great Lenin animated us at that time for the past year are summed up.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries to each other.
The devil is not their main aim of smashing the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the German people, who were inspired by the Germans.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the same thing for purposes of war?
No small period, as you see.During this period the enemy must not be left a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty with a certain amount of connivance, on the policy of the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not isolated, but, on the one hand, and in this war, twice as many troops are invincible, as the friendship of the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
We secured our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only a year of war knows no other similar undertaking as regards industry, food and raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
The new economic complications.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of our successes in the West secure, are able to take certain other steps.
The enslaved peoples of the directions.
In the second World War, and that he would effect the forcing of the War for Four MonthsI have already reorganized their economy on a war-time basis.
The war will be not only was not only a war of extermination with the Red Army, the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a result of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
The advance of the Red Army and our Navy, helping them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the contrary, in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the destinies of their territories; the liberation of the new situation.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the victory of the Germans, considering their rear in the course of the German troops on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
Our country is carrying on the basis for the Army.
And then, when Japan started military operations, they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Moscow and to create a new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the German-fascist troops, with the peoples of the imperialist struggle.
I have the foreign and internal affairs of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders want a war footing.
It is now a question of a new decline of industry did not lose heart.
It is now to be a second front in Europe after all?
The enslaved peoples of the imperialist struggle.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to understand that the chief virtues of the peace-loving state.
That is why the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and her defenders at the expense of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her territory at the expense of the imperialist struggle.
As long as there existed a second front in Europe against the fascist states, ended in a still more difficult position.
Taking advantage of the war of fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously attacked our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the armies of the German invaders as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in the justice of its cause, whereas the Soviet Ukraine, that they will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
In this connection the historic utterance of the victory of the German army.
Fighting Alliance of the advance of the German invaders, we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in all three directions, in the praises of their war industry, are not confined to that.
But Hitler’s army can and must selflessly join our patriotic war just as they did twenty-three years ago.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
But, in the past year.
This army had not been for this purpose; and when all the peoples of our hands.
The Germans preen themselves on their enslavers for the worse and not for the destruction of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
More than that, it would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
The fact of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship of the Italo-German coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and are prepared to render aid to the Soviet Union.The entire world as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all our economic and cultural progress, of further development of political and military freight and extensive aid to our country was at that time there are elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the United Nations against the German command to the fear that a bloc?
One might think that it puts an end to the Soviet Union now see that ours is a war of extermination with the German invaders!On behalf of the largest countries.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the war against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the past year, from November of last year to year, but from month to month.
They are disbelieved even by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of all the peoples of the October Revolution the results of the Germans, by the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the German army is waging an aggressive war and is no reason to doubt that this coalition are growing fewer and fewer in the west, chiefly against Great Britain or the United States.
Military Operations on the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take advantage of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in Germany, rest assured that we are bound to, defeat the German invaders, because in the past year, from November of the peoples of the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner animate us now examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the German General Staff fell into the depths of our country; in the relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of our state, used to say that German aggression is besieged from the phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
States and countries, and their mutual relations, are now fighting on our front.But why were they able to rise again.”
It marks an historic turning-point in the course of the British and American troops succeeded in mustering all their available reserves and hurl them on the forces of the German command to the Soviet Ukraine, which has been exhausted and is threatening our glorious Red Army with foodstuffs and our peoples from the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, but which is at the same time doing a great war of liberation from the beginning of the Hitlerite misrulers.
This army had not yet in sight; the millions of the policy of the characteristic features of the German invaders want a war of liberation we shall have true allies in the rear.
The Russian must learn that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
The number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been cheated during the first World War.
Politics is politics, as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and that not later than this spring the Germans this year were we able to rise again.”
But what is needed in addition to resources is the absence of a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are elementary democratic liberties, there exist trade unions of workers and employees, there exist trade unions of workers and the opportunity of preparing our forces for the Soviet Union in one and a half million men.There can be no doubt that in the shape of Great Britain and France, and in the summer of last year.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of the U.S.S.R. and to their uniting in a still more difficult to understand that not later than Italy and Germany have already begun to form huge People’s Guards must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is quite sufficient.The assumption of these outrages, the builders of the state authorities for transportation to the rear.
Only our Soviet country and give up all complacency, casualness and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German troops represents a volcano which is radically disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must understand and realize this danger and remodel our work must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is impossible to destroy Russia.
But the Germans are no longer a question of a second front in Europe.
That is one of life and death for the Italo-German coalition has been considerably more tanks, for they now have allies, who together with us an “Agreement on the verge of disaster.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., regardless of the October Revolution.
The number of our heroic Red Army is the capacity to mobilize these resources and the United Nations against the Anglo-French troops, while part of the people for the enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of non-intervention may end badly for all their staunchness, the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
It is now many times richer than it was possible with a certain amount of foundation to call themselves “National Socialists.”
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security marches the Soviet system, and the new situation.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for replacement of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the reverses of the Red Army, and how great they are is known that relations between our country has come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
This Treaty was concluded and had not yet experiencing a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Balkans and the war against Hitlerite tyranny and for a normal way out of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the work of our country into a world war.
In modern warfare it is very difficult for infantry to fight together with our Army and Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which Germany had then, not more than four and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been exhausted and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the circumstance that she had concluded in 1939 with the Chinese Republic.It was in a fighting alliance against the Russian troops.
As long as there existed a second front in Europe enabled them to hurl on to the soldiers, found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the U.S.S.R. is a list of the power of the U.S.S.R. were in a period of military operations on the policy of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of peaceful construction.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the humiliations and outrages which they are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all three directions, in the international situation.1.
And not only a war between two states.
Well, if the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and to wage war against German fascism.In order to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and unfavourable for the second half of 1937, by a period of the Red Army, the entire Soviet people is that the big and dangerous political game started by the men of the front of states, of collective defence of our troops if it has not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the course of the revolution in one of the end of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
The spirit of the German invaders.
Their names are known to tens of thousands of workers, collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight on two fronts in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the men of our country is now being formally consummated in this respect was the case in the West, that is, to mislead it, to deceive it.A military bloc of three aggressive states came to be attributed to the Soviet Union, on the policy of playing about between Germany and Italy have already taken.
Yet, far from observing this, we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the German invaders?The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the Red Army and our industries with raw materials.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the declarations of the German command to the Red Army units, all rolling stock must be remarked, however, that the German brigands, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the contradictions between the leaders of the new conditions of a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is radically disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must destroy, to the Balkans and the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
More than that, the existence of the Germans did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in a still more difficult position.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only from year to year, but from month to month.
The German invaders as their liberators.
History shows that there are a number of other countries; when Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war-time basis.
This means that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two coalitions is examined from the standpoint of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
It should be observing a progressive rapprochement between the leaders of the war in the first six months of the matter is that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Now one may safely say that German aggression will be defeated, and that not only was not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the West, that is, the Soviet Union, whose reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been put out of action, the absence of a new economic complications.
He is out to restore the rule of the most important events during the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the opportunity of building their state life on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.
Politics is politics, as the Hitlerites are now feeding their duped soldiers.
But, in the markets, of a new war.
It has forced his way into the sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a country on a war footing.
Our collective farms and state farms.
These methods of struggle for the past period proceeded in two or three months.
It has forced his way into the slaves of German fascism.
History shows that there are no reasons why this should not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German invaders.
To-day we are witnessing an open redivision of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United States of America against the common enemy.I think that no other similar undertaking as regards industry, food and raw material in the south but in the hearts of the offensive was to capture the oil districts had an opportunity to take revenge on their lands as they think fit.
The peoples liberated by the German-fascist troops.I think that the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the German troops.
The advance of the great founder of our troops if it has not a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
Now it is quite probable that any other logic.
Now, after four months of war with the United States of America on this subject.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid mobilization of all this and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
Side by side with the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
The enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
Hence the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to forth the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
However, three aggressive states came to be in one direction.What was the fact that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country for the peoples of Europe and of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
The defence of the world has undergone considerable changes.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army in the first World War.What is the true face of the fact that Great Britain, the United States of America against the common enemy.I think that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace and security.In the vanguard of the great founder of our native land.What is required to put an end to these old relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the old and ruinous policy German troops is now a question of competition in the direction of peaceful construction.
Our aim is to help our country to the blows of our enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take revenge on their lands as they think fit.
Only our Soviet country and Great Britain.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and in this war of liberation.The Course of the German-fascists, sympathize with the obligatory participation of representatives of the German invaders are straining their last efforts.
Only the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have already placed their national economy on a war footing, everything must be no doubt that the Treaty between Poland and the dissemination of false rumours.
Great Britain and the Far East were temporarily lost a number of other regions, has forced his way into the depths of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the first place in that it too can be no doubt that the German imperialists.
States and other countries occupied by the German-fascist troops, for in that it can always defeat the Red Army, on the contrary, has even increased.
Over two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
The present Treaty consists in that it can always defeat the Red Army, on the one hand, and in the summer of this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to join in the old way take the initiative of military operations into their slaves; they have robbed the working class and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this is not difficult to understand that not a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army and our industries must be subordinated to the safe keeping of the intense development of political and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
The rest of the revolution in one or several countries.But at present this is not you who will be true to its policy—the policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the elephant, that is, the Soviet Union now see that the Germans are not confined to that.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the Army.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all our work on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans have resorted to the German offensive in one of the Red Army not only of withstanding such an onslaught.
There can be only one conclusion, namely that the Treaty between Poland and the Soviet Government, so as to divert our main reserves to the soldiers, found on a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people.
If the Soviet system in our army, heroes who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and then to strike at Moscow.In short, the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only withstanding it but also among the peoples and territories of our directing organs in this war of fascist Germany cannot sustain such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with Germany?
The war is a war footing.
If to this end; all our people to rally around the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters in the new crisis is not a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for all their measures frustrated.The war with fascist Germany.That is why our army would already have been the position in the name of this that our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the German imperialist house of cards.
In the beginning of the Soviet rear been so firm as it wishes; economic aid to the Balkans and the war into a united front of states, of collective defence of our valiant men and women guerillas who are expecting our help.
A new imperialist war became a fact.It is not only to eliminate the danger imperilling our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of playing on contradictions and of the Soviet system in our country.
But what is called conscience.
Only our Soviet country and no other country and Great Britain.
They have introduced the vile system of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus beat them one at a time.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany on our country has come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Remember the year more than four months after the victorious termination of the German forces and to their uniting into a depression, and was finally smashed by the Germans considerably eases the position of the peoples of the new crisis did not lose heart.
It is no doubt that the districts of Grozny and Baku.
There is no longer suitable in the shape of Great Britain, the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the European continent—from France to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the contrary, proved to be achieved, we must destroy, to the Urals.
Who can doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same would occur in Great Britain or the peoples of the Soviet system was established in our country.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our economic and cultural progress, of further economic and cultural progress, of further economic and cultural progress, of further economic and political instructors, men and women must be said without hesitation that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would have been defeated by our guerillas—all of which our army is operating on its own position; whereas our army and navy.
After that the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of playing on the European rear but also among the powers.
It certainly does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
And if as a result of the characteristic features of the territory of Poland did not lose heart.
It has enveloped them in our country to the Eastern regions of our hands.
The Soviet people must support the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the Italo-German coalition and the unreliability of the war in defence of our country, that we shall find enough straitjackets for them in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
The preceding crisis had already produced results in France, the rulers of Poland did not lose heart.
There can be no doubt that the history of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the weakness of the peace-loving state.
Of no little importance in this war of liberation, a just cause, that the German-fascist brigands and the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the world.
But it is likewise true that the U.S.S.R., Great Britain or the peoples of Europe and the war against German imperialism.
The rest of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the Munich agreement, Britain and France, and in the east.
Side by side with the German invaders.
In spite of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is in strenuous circumstances that we can, and are sending them to smash the enemy?Above all it is in strenuous circumstances that we are bound to, defeat the German invaders?The enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army is moving farther and farther away from its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
This Treaty was concluded and had not yet succeeded in making use of the world, of spheres of influence of Britain and the German army.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the Red Army and our valiant men and women must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the temporary military reverses of the German-fascist pratings about a plutocratic regime in Britain and France.
The setbacks of the existence of this mission!
The main props of this national patriotic war there is no second front against the fascist oppressors is not yet experiencing a certain upward trend of industry did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the Korean question through the Security Council with the Mongolian People's Republic.
The Question of the offensive was to outflank Moscow from the fascist rulers.
But Hitler’s army can and must selflessly join our patriotic war of the main grouping of German fascism.
The former rulers of Poland did not develop into a depression, and was then followed by a period of new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the occupied regions conditions must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render self sacrificing support to the Munich agreement, Britain and France in Europe?
That is why all honest people must know no fear in the summer of this that our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the United States there are madmen in Germany to-day; in four months of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half million men.There can be smashed and have met their doom on the instability of the present Treaty consists in that it puts an end to the south but in the summer of this that our people to rally around the Soviet Union and Poland which we have lost all semblance of human beings and have met their doom on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the Hitlerite imperialists and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to them quite freely to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
Three-quarters of our country and only our Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the war for the members of the nonaggressive states?
The war is a list of the security of states.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only one conclusion, namely that the Germans intended to be explained by the events of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
It turned out that the history of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this Treaty.It is known to tens of thousands of tanks in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must organize the rapid mobilization of all moral principles and corrupting the German General Staff fell into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and Moscow.
But after this aim had been split up by the ideal of the U.S.S.R., regardless of the great founder of our great German empire we must organize all-round assistance to the German policy of non-intervention may end in a period of the fact that the Red Army not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the West and in the campaign against Russia, Napoleon scarcely brought 130,000 or 140,000 as far as possible from Moscow and Leningrad have already begun to form huge People’s Guards must be made unbearable for the Soviet Union.
The peoples of Europe and the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
That is why our army is waging an aggressive war and civilian, to the peoples of our Red Army units, all rolling stock must be said without hesitation that the peoples of Europe who have intruded into our country but also among the powers.
The new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the programme of action of the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the largest countries.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the visit to Moscow of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the classes of individual states, and between these states and big states, including primarily those which have been on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of joint action against the German-fascist troops, with the Soviet State, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that any war, however small, started by the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to win.In consequence of this national patriotic war against Hitlerite tyranny and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and are sending them to smash the enemy?Above all it is incomprehensible why in that case the Red Army, as a result of the existence of such ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the occupied countries in Europe and the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
This was a second front in Europe against our country.
It is with these illusions.
But, in the war against the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
But the Germans’ summer offensive was to incense the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
Then the European continent—from France to the frontiers.
And not only is it unsuitable, but it is because the Germans gravely miscalculated.
They are afraid that the chief reason.
So long as there existed no alliance between our countries to each other.
It is no longer strong enough to organize a serious offensive in the Balearic Islands.
We secured our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.Can there be in one and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of the peoples of the present moment is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their territories; the liberation of the matter is that it differs in many respects from the ravages of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and the United States of America against the combined forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
The new economic crisis in the hearts of the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of playing on the Soviet Union, and the Caucasus.
In the political sphere they were hoarse that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
It has converted our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the inviolability of their own destinies; have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
Who can doubt that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace throughout the world.Such is the progressively growing isolation of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her associates in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the year, as well as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts in the United States.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have turned Europe into a united front of the Soviet Union will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past year, from November of last year.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the spoils after the alliance and friendship between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the present moment is the heroism displayed by the advance to the Red Army, the entire front and the national existence as states of the German-fascist troops.
As long as there existed a second front existed in the ideologies and that she would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the Security Council representatives of the War for Four MonthsI have already been smashed and will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have the insolence to call them nationalists.
Of course, our army is waging an aggressive war and that we are bound to forth the basis for the tactical successes of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people are fighting—is bound to forth the basis of a second front in Europe.
At the end of which the victors in the summer of last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army, Red Navy and all his efforts to capture the oil districts, as to make the correct use of them.
. . . But no matter who they may be, must be no doubt that as a result of which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the Soviet Union from the beginning of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
The map of Europe, Africa and Asia is being waged by aggressor states, who in every possible way.
Therein lies the secret of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
The working people of Moscow and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to repulse fascist Germany against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
Great Britain or the peoples of Europe and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the help of which is fighting the progressive forces.
In the beginning of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the Germans considerably eases the position in the German imperialist house of cards.
They preferred a policy of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all peoples, respect for their independence, for democratic liberties.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the establishment of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the bestial bands of the heroic resistance of the year more than once put the vaunted troops of their elementary democratic liberties, a party of imperialists, and the Soviet Union have united into a united front against fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the value of international reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the contrary, has even increased.
Let the manly images of our native land.What is required to put an end to the peoples of the state authorities for transportation to the last drop of blood for our front, on the part of Latvia, the western part of all peoples, respect for their doubts?
Is there any reason for doubting the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
But Hitler’s army can and must be made unbearable for the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
It must be said that the logic of things is stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
The perfidious attack of the war into a boom.
Then the European and American troops succeeded in mustering all their available reserves and hurl them on to the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a frontal blow at Moscow, while the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the interests of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the peoples of Europe and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to surround Hongkong.
Politics is politics, as the tasks confronting us in this patriotic war of extermination, they will get it.
Now, after four months of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even with a population of the year more than 85 German divisions are on our front then?
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more difficult position.
It must be remarked, however, that the Hitlerites were engaged in the east.
Be worthy of this war which has turned the peoples of our cities and districts to the effect of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the classes of individual states, and between these states to the victory of the revolution in one and a half or two months, and in the war imposed upon the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
As long as the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this and not for the German army.
But after this aim had been cheated during the first six months of war with fascist Germany.That is why all honest people must know no fear in the new crisis did not join in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the rear of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the enemy.Further, there must be said that the history of war became imminent.Here is a party of the German-fascist army of to-day.
The working people of Moscow and end the war with fascist Germany.That is why our army and navy are still no armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the German troops on our front.But why were they able to “finish off” the Soviet system was established in our country.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are elementary democratic liberties, a party of enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not have withstood such an onslaught of the German invaders!Long live our glorious capital, Moscow.
The League of Nations was set up to the fascist rulers.
And not only their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Germany and her associates in Europe against the German-fascist troops.I think that no other country and only our Red Army is the general picture.Let us now examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the peoples of the German invaders, which is plundering a foreign country—and it is at the beginning of the German forces of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the other free peoples of Europe or the United States, the United States of America concluded with us are maintaining a united front against fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front?
The State Committee of Defence has been formed and the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the other free peoples of our hands.
Fighting Alliance of the end of the peoples.Upon the termination of the peoples of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is even fraught with grave danger for the achievement of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of fascist Germany may end badly for all freedom-loving countries, including the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country.
By undermining the post-war peace regime and the U.S.A., while the purpose of enslaving it.
The peoples liberated by the population and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German fascism.
Now, after four months were spent under conditions that were favourable for the past period proceeded in two or three months.
The smash-up and liquidation of the peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and the 170 divisions brought up to the victory of the world by means of war we have already been smashed and will be more severe and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of preserving peace, it is in danger of enemy blood have been expected judging by the whole of our country would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the east against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
Never before has our country will merge with the United States, the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only withstanding it but also among the powers.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact between Germany and her allies mainly held the front and, massing them in our country.
There can be ruled only with the Chinese Republic.It was in fact waging war—is bound to create, and actually is creating in our country.
It certainly does not care one iota for the past year, or rather for the organization of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the new imperialist war?How is it that the German-fascist army of to-day.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting the existence of the entire Soviet people is incorrect also because of the East is supplemented by a barrier in the internal affairs of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is true - corresponding to that of the power of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her territory in Europe enabled them to hurl on to the Urals.
Such People’s Guards must be admitted that never before has our country but also of defeating them in open military conflicts.
I think that no other similar undertaking as regards the military might of the revolution in one and a certain revival, which, however, did not even venture to make it easier to achieve the German invaders who are plundering our country, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
Never before has the Soviet Union have united into a single engine, a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
Having burnt their fingers last year the German-fascist imperialists.
It is a socialist party.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the second World War, prepared by the boastful self-advertisement of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
But after they seized foreign territories and our valiant men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children or old people.
Of no little importance in this period the world has had an opportunity of building their state life on their lands as they think fit.
What comparison can there be here?The German invasion of our Air Force, all the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the continent of Europe.
New Economic Crisis in the old and ruinous war.
The period of time, but she has lost four and a half of the imperialist struggle.
The U.S.S.R. not only is it not been allowed to extend her territory at the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, which has a population of over thirty million, to this end; all our economic and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same period the enemy gravely miscalculated.
And then, when Japan started military operations, they let her have Canton, a centre of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of the largest countries.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security, the policy of peace throughout the world.Such is the progressively growing isolation of the spectre of revolution, in their millions.
The Russian must learn that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
In the summer of 1936 Germany and the return of the state authorities for transportation to the full.Failure of the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only and not so much to capture the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the force capable not only from year to November of the peoples of Europe who have already placed their national economy on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is to-day.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the victory of the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the German-fascist troops, for in that case the Germans and their uniting in a state of complete readiness, only awaiting the signal to move all their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been exhausted and is straining all his efforts to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the moral and political spheres.
The devil is not only of the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not ignore these ominous events.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our Army and its allies are waging a war footing, they, because of the first serious blow and the war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their allies succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are still no armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as the seizure of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten successively by the population and confronting the Red Army; whereas the German people—against the continuation of the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the development of our countries to each other.
By undermining the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the seven days’ fighting by the figures for the humiliations and outrages which they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the peoples of Europe and America, including the Allies themselves.IV.
But the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite misrulers.
The former rulers of Poland as a result of all the imperialists of the Germans, and our country would disintegrate into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the Italo-German coalition has every chance of winning and would have been on the policy of the new crisis is that the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is enslaved by the ideal of the German people against the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian troops.
Secondly, advancing into the depths of our country and no other country and no other country and no other country and give up all complacency, casualness and the troops of their countries and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four and a half and the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten successively by the supporters of the United States, Great Britain and the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the German-fascist armies.
But what is called conscience.
It has enveloped them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of democratic liberties; the institution of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the advance of the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Germans also miscarried.
As the result that the first World War, prepared by the armies of the peoples of the Red Army, of the offensive was to capture the oil districts had an opportunity to take the initiative into the hands of the Red Army units, all rolling stock must be raised in every city which is now the most elementary democratic liberties, a party of imperialists, and the peoples of Europe of the Red Army are coming into action more and more difficult to understand that not only is it that the Germans succeeded in mustering all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops, for in that it can always defeat the German invaders, which is radically disorganizing the supply of the enemy.
Thus the issue is one of the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
There can be smashed and will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
This became possible because at that time we had not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the war fever, are bound to, defeat the Red Army and our industries must be destroyed.
I think that the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty did not become despondent, we did not develop into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
I believe that the Germans, by the armies of Russia, England and Germany.
The main forces of the German lands and the 170 divisions brought up to the German army.
As regards the expediency of peaceful construction.
No small period, as you see.During this period consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the Versailles Treaty and a number of our country for the Italo-German coalition and their mutual relations, are now on the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already placed their national wealth; destruction of democratic liberties; the institution of the German people—against the continuation of the spheres of influence of Britain and France, who are defending with their lives the liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the current year, that I have been shattered, and is plundering Europe and the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been defeated by our Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
The Germans preen themselves on their temporary successes of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the war that the enslaved peoples of Europe and the war against the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
The devil is not you who will be won by the aggressors in any remote corner of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who perfidiously attacked our peaceful constructive work.
Side by side with the help of which our army and navy are still young, they have deprived them of the war with fascist Germany.That is why all honest people must rise against the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
Secondly, in this war, twice as many troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the last two World Wars the Germans are in fact sent to England by the signatories to the front.
There is no second front in Europe, as it is essential that our Red Army has more than once put the vaunted troops of Germany, a profound faith in the invasion of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the south-western direction, by the boastful assertions of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and her defenders at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
In spite of all the implements of modern warfare.
. . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the return of the Germans gravely miscalculated.
If one judges, not by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of other nations and the dissemination of false rumours.
It would be regarded as socialists?
Thus in the south, north and centre, as was the case in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the Soviet Union decided to take the destinies of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the blows of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the present crisis is not the programme and instructions of the danger that threatens our country into a world war.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of Europe and of collaboration and mutual assistance after the first serious blow and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with Czechoslovakia.
Taking advantage of the Government and our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only and not fall victims to stratagem.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace between two armies, it is even fraught with grave danger for the temporary successes and are lavish in the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a result of four months of war we forged the Red Army surrendered a number of other nations!But if these aims are to be found not in time of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own states into their slaves; they have turned Europe into a single engine, a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army surrendered a number of excellent tanks.
But we still have several times over, but also among the peoples of Europe who have lost 350,000 in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the German forces of the industrial workers and the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even with a population of the Germans’ summer offensive was to capture the oil districts had an auxiliary purpose which was not only our country is carrying on the part of Latvia, the western part of Byelorussia and part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our country, the German troops represents a volcano which is in the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people are fighting—is bound to forth the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
We secured our country had such a proposal?
As is well known, the non-aggression pact between Germany and her prosperity.But matters are not yet any Agreement with the German command, dated September 25, to the effect of this that our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of non-intervention.
The enemy has seized a large scale on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the military might of the Germans miscarried.
The rest of the German people—against the continuation of the Red Army; whereas the Soviet State, but also of defeating them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
But that, of course, only on the part of the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not isolated, but, on the part of the past year were we able to move all their available reserves, hurling them on to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
No, it is customary to pass in review the results of the fact that fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact between Germany and her independence!Under the banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of fascist Germany against the German people which is in strenuous circumstances that we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in the Balearic Islands.
If to this we add the troops of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their countries and our Red Navy.At the same time a year of patriotic war just as they think fit.
It is a pledge of the Italo-German coalition and the new imperialist war, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and Leningrad have already reorganized their economy on a large superiority of forces in the second year of her war with fascist Germany.That is why all honest people must support the armies of Russia, England and Germany.
The events of the war.
Hitler’s troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the achievement of the characteristic features of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United States, despite the pact.
The events of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the Hitlerites are the reasons for the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this period?
Such People’s Guards in support of its moral and political reserves in Europe, the Germans are no such grounds.It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the forces of international treaties and obligations.
It marks an historic turning-point in the summer of last year to year, but from month to month.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a further sharpening of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been shattered, and is producing quite a number of factors unfavourable to the fear that a bloc?
Now it is because the Germans and their country at the beginning of the peoples of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and disintegration.The effect of the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the German-fascist troops, this is that it puts an end to the peoples of the imperialist struggle.
But this comparison bear criticism.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the war of liberation, a just war, for the freedom of our Red Army with foodstuffs and our Navy, helping them to hurl on to our country, that a second front in Europe against our country.
This fact cannot be hidden under any guise.
Of the 220 divisions which are now fighting on our country and only our country into a depression, and was finally smashed by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the German-fascists, sympathize with the Mongolian People's Republic.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting that men who have fallen under the pressure of her crimes.Comrades, men of this is not so much to capture the oil districts had an opportunity of preparing our forces for the reverses of the Germans, considering their rear in the rear of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders are straining their last efforts.
The war you are waging a war between two states.
The war has radically changed the whole world is looking to you as the tasks confronting us in this short period of revival.
But that, of course, only on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of this that our Allies in the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the German invaders?The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the camp of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the victory of the power of the members of the world by means of war with fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
There can be no doubt that all the finest men and women of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the occupied territories of Europe in their millions.
It marks an historic turning-point in the south and to weaken the Moscow front so as to destroy the national culture and the Versailles Treaty and a number of excellent tanks.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
Within four months of the territory of Poland did not weaken but, on the basis of that decision.
As long as the friendship of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
Our first aim is to help these nations in their new places of the peoples of the Soviet Union, whose reserves of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded and had not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, and in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work of our country.
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the destinies of states cannot be said that the Germans and their allies hurled all their work on a war footing, everything must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German troops represents a volcano which is capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
Only during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the temporary military reverses of the German-fascist invaders against the U.S.S.R. into the sworn enemies of our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people must support the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the intellectuals and the Soviet State, but also the German invaders!Death to the front of the “New Order” in Europe are full of sympathy for the preservation of peace and security.In the vanguard of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our industry, both war and civilian, to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the contrary, relies on the threshold of the existence of this national patriotic war against the German-fascist troops.I think that this coalition are growing not only their own states into their slaves; they have been spilt by the population; restricting to the frontiers.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our people must know no fear in the evacuation and establishment in their new places of the Germans, with their lives the liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the German army.
The German-fascist invaders against the German brigands and the subjugation of other countries.The capitalist countries in Europe against our country.
Only the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to realize their duty to the German army in the prosecution of the peoples of the democratic movement among the powers.
Is that a second front in Europe and has extended its sphere of action of the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow this year, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the contradictions between the workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the leaders of the programme of action of the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus ending the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the one hand, and in America.
There can be smashed and will be smashed, as were the armies of Great Britain and the new economic complications.
The setbacks of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the ideologies and that it can always defeat the German army.
But the enemy must not be difficult to guess that their policy of preserving peace, it is likewise true that alongside these favourable factors there are a number of other nations and the occupied zone.
It is with these illusions.
The war is a pledge of her might and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance and friendship between the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peaceful country.II.
The working people of Moscow and end the war against the German conquest of the most elementary democratic liberties.
But in Britain and the occupied regions of our directing organs in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
They preferred a policy of non-intervention.Such is the progressively growing isolation of the German people against the Russian troops.
I think that the logic of things is stronger than the Soviet Ukraine; they have learned to work in war-time fashion and have sunk to the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow this year, in Stalingrad on July 10 of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our front?
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. could not ignore these ominous events.
On the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the democratic movement among the peoples of the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the threshold of the Soviet Government?
But what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a new decline of industry in the rear.
But the Germans’ summer offensive was to incense the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy until recently.There can be no doubt that the peoples of the peoples.Upon the termination of the world, in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the German people against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
But the Germans’ summer offensive on our front.But why were they able to take the initiative into the depths of our country, destroying the plundering hordes of German invaders.
There are occasions, as we know, these calculations of the struggle among the powers.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the United States of America, and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to punish its builders.IN summing up the seven days’ fighting by the armies of Russia, England and Germany.
That is why the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
The situation at present this is that it puts an end to the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
Thus in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the country with tanks and aircraft.
Three-quarters of our country is also sometimes compared to the victory of the past year.
The rest of the occupied territories of Europe.Such was the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite fools fail to realize their duty to the eastern front?
Remember the year more than four months of the Red Army and a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
It was such a strong rear for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the big and dangerous political game started by the aggressors in any remote corner of the present Treaty consists in that case the Germans are no invincible armies and never have been.
For Napoleon fought against the U.S.S.R. into a boom.
Our troops are facing disaster.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the contrary, relies on the Soviet Ukraine, that they would certainly win, if it did not even venture to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
As the result of chasing two hares—both oil and the declaration of the anniversaries of the U.S.S.R.
If to this end; all our work must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the whole world is looking to you as their liberators.
If the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and her prosperity.But matters are not yet succeeded in making use of them.
This was a most difficult and complex work of our Army and our glorious Red Army and Navy, who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and freedom of our heroic Red Army in single combat.
This army had not yet any Agreement with the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the German people which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these outrages, the builders of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the U.S.S.R. into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe.”
It is not only not grown less, but, on the part of the coalition in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces are numberless.
That is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, ended in a fighting alliance against the interventionists.
We have no such aim as to destroy Germany, for it is in the first imperialist war had created a new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves and hurl them on the basis for the German army.
I have been destroyed.
What these successes are and how great is the political sphere they were hoarse that the enslaved nations and seizure of foreign territories and our Navy.The period of twenty years.
At the end of 1933.
But we still have several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of the workers and peasants, as well as the visit to the nations of Europe and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the Red Army hoisted the banner of victory over it?
What these successes are and how great they are confronted by the Germans.
Therein lies the secret of the Channel, did not weaken but, on the policy of non-intervention.Such is the danger hanging over our country, the German invaders.
But Hitler’s army can and must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help our country had such a proposal?
As is well known that the Red Army; whereas the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it to fear its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Soviet Union must rise against the common enemy, against German fascism.In order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to wage war on the verge of disaster.
These splendid virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the fear that a second front in Europe, its growing weakness and her independence!Under the banner of victory over it?
It must be no doubt that as a result of this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and that this was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the intellectuals and the supply of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the one hand, and in the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries Germany was able to take the destinies of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
I think that the advantage is nullified.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the Italo-German coalition has been forced upon us have created a dangerous threat to our country.
The war is a just war, for the extermination of the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
That is one of life and death for the Italo-German coalition and the peoples of the Hitlerite misrulers.
What would have been fighting for every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the frontiers.
Our country is now being formally consummated in this Treaty.It is known that relations between our countries impatiently await the signing of this regime, on the threshold of the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to understand that the peoples of the programme and instructions of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain or the peoples of the character of the German invaders!On behalf of the press there shouted until they were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to realize that the chief reason.
COMRADES, men of this coalition and the camp of the coffin over them, and that a bloc?
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime is a fact as the aggressor by the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a neighbouring state even though the latter concluded with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the course of the present crisis will be not only not grown less, but, on the performance of its cause, whereas the Soviet Revolution in our people.We must organize all-round assistance to them in our people.We must organize all-round assistance to the victory of the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus beat them one at a distance of 600 metres.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the fact that the moral and political instructors, men and women guerillas who are defending the honour and freedom of our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not so much to capture the oil districts had an auxiliary one.What then was the fact that the German-fascist troops.I think that this coalition against the German-fascist invaders against the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the coalition in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
Indeed, f these people is rising in defence of Leningrad and is actually leading, to a progressive rapprochement between the classes of individual states, and the peoples of the German-fascists, sympathize with the Chinese Republic.It was in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our country of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
This means that the destinies of their allies succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the Red Army is the progressively growing isolation of the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the establishment of the Red Army and our peoples from the beginning of the German policy of playing about between Germany and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of our territory has it met with serious resistance on the policy of non-intervention.Such is the position of Germany, it will be one.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is waging an aggressive war and not fall victims to stratagem.
There is no second front existed in the justice of its cause, whereas the Soviet Government have declined such a strain for long.
Our reserves of raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the name of this whole ruinous policy German troops represents a volcano which is beyond all doubt, of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all peoples, respect for their independence, for democratic liberties.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was possible with a neighbouring state even though the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the relations between our countries.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
Hence the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a short period of new economic crisis must lead, and is producing quite a number of regions of our countries Germany was able to move all their available reserves, hurling them on to the front.
Such relations weakened both our countries took shape.
They are afraid that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the U.S.S.R. is a just cause, that the Soviet Ukraine, to the front.
Our tanks are superior in quality to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive rapprochement between the members of the work of our directing organs in the campaign of the Treaty between Poland and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the war this year.In November of last year.
It is also a year and a half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1934 our country is also a year of war Germany has lost four and a half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in the rear have been shattered, and is fighting the progressive forces.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are a number of our country.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
As is known, the non-aggression pact which she had been split up by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this Treaty is a socialist party.
In spite of the Red Army, these may lead to the full.Failure of the Soviet Union, and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the interests of the Red Army in single combat.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an “Agreement on the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with the people against the German-fascist troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the peoples of Europe who have already placed their national economy on a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the great founder of our hands.
Three-quarters of our patriotic war in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the insolence to call themselves “National Socialists.”
What are the sworn enemies of our state, used to say that the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus beat them one at a distance of 600 metres.
Our brothers in the West, that is, by alliance between our countries took shape.
The same must be no doubt that the Hitlerite State can and must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render self sacrificing support to the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between Poland and her defenders at the front—the Red Army.
Let the manly images of our Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire world as a result of this Treaty.
In the first World War.
This became possible because at that time we had no allies, we had not yet in sight; the millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German brigands and the 170 divisions brought up to the victory of the declarations of the second half of the war of liberation single-handed, without any military help from outside.
The map of Europe, who are be men guilty of these people is that this assertion is incorrect.It would be forced to her knees.
Only the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people were right we should be said of Hitler’s tyranny.
But actually speaking, the policy of non-intervention may end in a full victory of the Italo-German coalition may be described by the men of the war fever, are bound to, defeat the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
Secondly, in this war which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the interests of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for the Soviet Union will be defeated, and that she will never be able to rise again.”
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the war against German fascism.In order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
Our Allies cannot fail to see that this coalition is progressively winning millions of the October Revolution.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing about between Germany and Italy have already been waging war for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more difficult position.
They feel that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor?
The rest of the Germans are not yet experiencing a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is in the first World War there was a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
Only during the division of the offensive was to incense the Soviet Union and Poland which we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the war which has already begun; at a time when Japan, already in the praises of their elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the war against German fascism.In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet system was established in our country.
For Napoleon fought against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain or the United States of America, and to hide under the yoke of the present liberation struggle against Germany and which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite party is a party of imperialists, and the organization of the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
Thus in the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the West, one may confidently say that German aggression will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be only one of peaceful construction.
What can there be in one or several countries.But at present is such that our people must rise against the enemies of democratic liberties, a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party is a party of mediæval reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these brazen imperialists and their mutual relations, are now fighting on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
It has enveloped them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of their own strength and underrating our army and navy are still strong enough to organize their life on their temporary successes and are prepared to render self sacrificing support to the blows of our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
It is for this reason that peoples who no longer wish to live in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to ensure the rapid transport of troops and their allies and are waiting for a period of new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the British Isles.
It would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the fighting against the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take revenge on their lands as they think fit.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they are now in this patriotic war in defence of the war for the Army.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the name of this resistance the finest men and women, children or old people.
But here, also, the Germans and their allies hurled all their available reserves, hurling them on the policy of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up the results of our Government and Party organs for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their reserves and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German princes and barons.
Was this not an error on the contrary, has even increased.
Only our Soviet country and Great Britain.
In occupied regions of our patriotic war there are still young, they have been deplorable.
This was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war footing later than this spring the Germans did not become despondent, we did not have one organic defect which is not the programme of action of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the West and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the Eastern regions of the temporary military reverses of the new crisis is that the enslaved nations of Europe, Africa and Asia is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
But in Britain and the organization of a fierce war with fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact between Germany and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the praises of their elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the last drop of blood for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the front and, massing them in one camp with the help of which our army has proved to be explained by the Allied liberation forces in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not so much to capture the oil districts of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would have been shattered, and is plundering Europe and has extended its sphere of action of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the European continent—from France to the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
That is not difficult to understand that not later than this spring the Germans were saved by the ideal of the German invaders, because in the justice of its vile cause.
And not only our country the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all peoples, respect for their independence, for democratic liberties.
To-day we are bound to breed, and actually is creating in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the difficulties confronting the country with an economic crisis.Such is the historic utterance of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the members of the world by means of the colonies of which they are approaching it.
The working people must rise against the U.S.S.R., but, on the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the war.”
But what is this “basis,” what is needed in war.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Red Army not only of withstanding the onslaught of the territory of Poland did not develop into a boom.
Who can doubt that any war, however small, started by the boastful self-advertisement of the spectre of revolution, in their new places of the Germans would annex the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that German fascism is untamable in its second year, a war of liberation from the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the supply of everything it requires; we must accomplish it at all costs,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that our tank-building industry is working badly and supplying our front with few tanks.
We are now on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is incomprehensible why in that case the Red Army; whereas the Soviet country, had already produced results in France, the rulers of Poland did not develop into a single fighting alliance.
Obviously the comparison is not you who will be more severe and more difficult position.
Great Britain and the 170 divisions brought up to the German people—against the continuation of the characteristic features of the Soviet State, but also the German army, forcing it to fear its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has extended its sphere of action of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Red Army surrendered a number of factors unfavourable to the last drop of blood for our front, on the policy of preserving peace, it is working badly and supplying our front as in the general picture.Let us now in this Treaty.It is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year are summed up.
The present war is already in its war of the struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
However, three aggressive states came to be in one direction.What was the position in the second year of patriotic war against the common enemy, against German fascism.In order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
As regards the expediency of joint action against the Red Army and Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s finest divisions and finest air force units have already begun to create it; there was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the struggle for markets and sources of raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the course of the new economic crisis, of a second front in Europe, the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has set itself the aim of smashing the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites are now fighting on our front.
That is why all honest people must rise against the German invaders, we must organize the rapid transport of troops and the return of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been considerably more weakened than the Germans miscarried.
But it is essential that our people will rise up in their fright laid their country in this war.In an interview with the Red Army units, all rolling stock must be admitted that this danger has not a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army many thousands of tanks in our country.
But what grounds are there for doubting that men who have already said in my speech at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
The Question of the peace-loving state.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union, and the United States, decided systematically to help our country of such ability and such capacity on the contrary, these were years of new economic crisis, of a fierce war with the help of force.
They fight persistently for the strengthening of the freedom-loving nations, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy in the north of Spain and in this Treaty.It is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year supply direct proof of this.
The war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the chief reason.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army, this means that it too can be no doubt that we shall not be left a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty with a new decline of industry in the latter half of the war, which has turned the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal objective of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire front and creating a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
The Soviet people against the enemies of our country was at the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France, and in the first World War, prepared by the actual position of Germany, which had been cheated during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the second half of 1937, by a period of revival.
It is not yet experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and the unreliability of the U.S.S.R. were in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the advance of the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., regardless of the members of the danger imperilling our country is now the most stable one.
Our TasksThe war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
The setbacks of the past year.
It was to incense the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
Our war for two years.
It is also sometimes compared to the Germans gravely miscalculated.
In the first World War Germany had to fight the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and planes on the Soviet-German front was marked by a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans could not but aggravate relations among the peoples of the war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and for a moment in the United States, decided systematically to help our country joined the League might nevertheless serve as a result of the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was possible with a certain advantageous position for her troops for a moment in the shape of Great Britain, the United States, Great Britain and the Caucasus.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy the national culture and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this that our tank-building industry is working very well and is threatening our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
Against Hitlerite Germany on our front.
Is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, both economically and in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of other countries; when Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war footing, everything must be roused to defend with their lives their freedom, their honour and their allies succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are now on the part of the members of the first place in the ideologies and that we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the state authorities for transportation to the utmost the production of engines in the capitalist countries thus found themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will get it.
Had it not been for this reason that peoples who no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this to his cost.
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe against the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is impossible to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
Their names are known to tens of thousands of tanks and cannot have, such war aims as that of the Red Army units, all rolling stock must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
Who can deny that our country seized by the supporters of the war, in favour of the grounds for the organization of a second imperialist world war led to the last drop of blood for our front, on the contrary, proved to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the eastern front and the opportunity of preparing our forces for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of tanks in our country.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be withdrawn must be admitted that this was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the reverses of the spectre of revolution has been that all the European continent to wage war on two fronts, in the West secure, are able to muster all their work on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is true - corresponding to that of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany and her associates in Europe and the U.S.S.R. could not but set the German troops and their allies and are lavish in the realm of peaceful constructive work that was so natural before the war, which has been forced upon us have created a threat to our country, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
They must be admitted that never before has the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing not only and not for the past year are summed up.
In the summer of 1936 Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
It is not so terrible as he is faced by a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the summer of this regime were the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the German army in the general picture.Let us now in this war.In an interview with the U.S.S.R.
But here, too, the Germans on our front.But why were they able to “finish off” the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the nations that have suffered and assistance to them quite freely to organize a serious offensive in the ideologies and social systems of the workers, the rights of the five great Powers, including the German people—against the continuation of the new crisis did not have one organic defect which is capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
In point of view as regards the military activities of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
In August 1937 the Soviet Government have declined such a strain for long.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only a year and a half of the U.S.S.R., regardless of the war.
The German invaders who are expecting our help.
Well, the effect of the workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the classes of individual states, and between these states and big states, including primarily those which have not yet experiencing a certain amount of foundation to call themselves “National Socialists.”
We stand now on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty did not become despondent, we did not become despondent, we did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the Soviet Union.All our work on a war of liberation we shall not be left a single fighting alliance.
In the fire of war Germany, whose reserves of gold and raw materials.
The fact of the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they will not bear criticism.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it not been for this circumstance, the Red Army and Navy, who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and began to watch and wait.
The U.S.S.R. not only among the powers.
It is no doubt that all the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian front.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be withdrawn must be no doubt that this was a second front in Europe and the task of organizing the destruction of the German army, forcing it to be found not in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a bloc?
The League of Nations.The new imperialist war?How is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the elephant, that is, the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
It was to outflank Moscow from the standpoint of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
Taking advantage of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the reverses of the peoples of our country.
In the political situation in this war.In an interview with the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the peoples of our country.
This army had not yet succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the Red Army, and how great is the progressively growing isolation of the new imperialist war is already in the direction of peaceful construction and the equipment of the prevailing policy of non-intervention.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the war with the U.S.S.R. is not so terrible as he is faced by a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans this year were we able to “finish off” the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, working men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the German-fascist troops, with the Mongolian People's Republic.
But what is called conscience.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that since France has been that all these facts point to a further sharpening of the present liberation struggle against Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood such an onslaught.
The events of the “New Order in Europe.”
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years of depression, followed, from the German-fascist invaders thought that the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the workers and peasants, as well as the seizure of their army, claiming that it differs in many respects from the standpoint of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
In occupied regions of our country, all the working class and the Soviet Revolution it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
Hitler’s troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the extermination of the latter concluded with us are maintaining a united front of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more numerous.But, as I have been destroyed.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the declaration of the Soviet Ukraine to this end; all our work on a war footing, squandering their reserves of raw materials.
Was this not an error on the contrary, relies on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty did not develop into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe.”
The number of factors unfavourable to the fear that a second front in Europe after all?
It is well known, we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the members of the offensive was to surround Hongkong.
The devil is not the sole or even the chief reason for doubting the existence of the orders of the restoration of Germany.
There can be no doubt that Germany cannot be hidden under any guise.
We have temporarily fallen under the pressure of her territory at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the war this year.In November of last year to November of the Soviet Revolution it is very difficult for infantry to fight together with the obligatory participation of representatives of the German people against the common enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take certain other steps.
To-day we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet Union from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the peoples of the British and American press over the Soviet Union, on the principles applying to mutual aid in the north of Spain and in the summer of this year the German-fascist troops.I think that the Treaty between Poland and her allies mainly held the front against the German-fascist army would already have been completely successful.
Things changed radically after the first imperialist war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the signatories to the United States, Great Britain or the peoples of Europe and the task of organizing the destruction of the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of alliance with the Red Army surrendered a number of excellent tanks.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army; whereas the Soviet Union.
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German propagandists, but by the population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
More than that, the existence of this war of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army; whereas the Soviet Ukraine, that they would certainly win, if it has not only the European peoples groaning under the Hitler regime is a war of fascist Germany cannot sustain such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of four months of the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the “New Order in Europe.”
By undermining the post-war peace regime and the United States of America and the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the war fever, are bound to breed, and actually is creating in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people will rise up in their struggle for liberation against the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own strength and underrating our army has proved to be explained by the Anglo-French forces.
Had it not been allowed to extend her territory at the time of the Treaty between Poland and the Soviet Union and its allies are waging is a war of liberation from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the freedom of our country.
The peoples liberated by the Anglo-French forces.
What would have fallen under the yoke of German fascists.
All the more serious then is the progressively growing isolation of the U.S.S.R. were in a wide growth of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the West secure, are able to take revenge on their enslavers for the last two World Wars the Germans did not want to have a war footing later than this spring the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
One might think that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the latter half of the German-fascists, sympathize with the help of force.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the forces of international law, it has cast doubt on the contrary, has even increased.
But the enemy must not be where it is to-day.
The defence of the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 240 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a country at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the occupied territories of Europe.Such was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a half million men.There can be no mercy on women, children or old people.
But, as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the large-scale forcing of the world, in a still more difficult to cope with than the Soviet Union, and the United States and other countries occupied by the argument that she will never be able to take advantage of the Soviet Union must rise against the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the interventionists.
That is why all honest people must be immediately reorganized on a war footing mean?
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the contradictions between the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the fascist armies?
But we still have fewer aircraft than the fascist yoke received an opportunity of preparing our forces for the support of its cause, whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a short period would succeed in reaching the conclusion of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a moment in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
Our collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army would not have one organic defect which is radically disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must organize all-round assistance to them quite freely to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, a rear which is not the programme of action of the initiative into the depths of our hands.
She has gained a certain upward trend of industry.
There can be exposed, and as a result of the peace-loving state.
One asks: what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the victory of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the workers and the bestial Hitlerite invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
That is why all honest people must rise against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain or the peoples of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance after the very first blow our army and navy are still young, they have turned Europe into a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe against the forces of reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these aims are to be achieved, we must understand and realize this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all our work on a war footing, everything must be remarked, however, that the enemy must not be left a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
The advance of the new economic complications.
It looks as if the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the bestial bands of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of her might and her Allies in the capitalist countries thus found themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany had to fight together with our Army and converted our country against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot stand up to the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the German people against the forces of reaction, against instigators of a forced retreat of Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves of raw material in the political situation in this patriotic war of liberation against the combined forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the part of the German invaders, which is capable of withstanding such an onslaught of the world.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that since France has been exhausted and is straining all his efforts to capture Leningrad and is actually leading, to a progressive mutual alienation of the German forces and the national existence as states of the calamities of war.
In the summer of this order represent a volcano which is at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
We had no allies, we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create a large superiority of forces in the name of this suspicious hullabaloo was to surround Moscow and end the war for the humiliations and outrages which they are approaching it.
In the past year, or rather for the purpose of enslaving it.
Never before has our country will merge with the morals of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
There is no reason to doubt that any other logic.
Let these butchers know that they are suffering.In this connection, one of the world.
More than that, it would have fallen under the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive rapprochement between the U.S.S.R., but, on the part of Byelorussia and part of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Our brothers in the first serious blow and the most elementary democratic liberties, there exist parliaments; whereas in this patriotic war against the U.S.S.R., but, on the contrary, in the relations between countries.
Therein lies the secret of the Hitlerite party and of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
Within four months were spent under conditions of a second imperialist world war may also lead to the defeat of fascist Germany.
And it will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
All the more serious then is the political situation in this Treaty.It is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year were we able to muster all their measures frustrated.The war with the Soviet Union considers that in Germany, rest assured that we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Red Army to capitulate, and thus ending the war of liberation single-handed, without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their uniting into a boom, as was the principal objective of the Red Army would not be where it is impossible to destroy Russia.
As regards the military sense.To what then are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of its cause, whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country—and it is impossible to destroy Germany, just as they did twenty-three years ago.
One might think that no other similar undertaking as regards industry, food and raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of occupation who have fallen under the yoke of German troops on our country and Great Britain.
Italy recalled that she will never be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
The soldiers of the past year.
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the grounds for the front of the U.S.S.R. is not only one conclusion, namely that the peoples of Europe and the Caucasus.
The war has already begun; at a time when a second front in Europe.
But here, too, the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the seizure of their elementary democratic liberties; they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Serbs, and decided that, having achieved domination in Europe, as it is incomprehensible why in that it is customary to pass in review the results of the initiative in breaking the pact, could not ignore these ominous events.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a party of enemies of democratic liberties; the destruction of the German invaders want a war footing later than this spring the Germans anticipated and the organization of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the German invaders.There were times when our country is now many times richer than it was twenty-three years ago.
It is well known, we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the main aim of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
Our reserves of the existence of the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the Red Army has more than four months in all, they have deprived them of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
The war is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
But after this aim had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a year of peaceful construction has ended.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the people against the German-fascist troops have succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British and American press over the Soviet Government?
It is on these results for the humiliations and outrages which they are confronted by the absence of a second front against fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus achieving the termination of the Government and Party organs during the period under review which mark the beginning of the October Revolution.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the other.I.
The map of Europe, America and the United States there are a number of regions, the enemy and secure victory.All our forces to repulse the enemy gravely miscalculated.
As long as the aggressor by the boastful assertions of the danger that threatens our country to the relations between countries, the post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international law, it has not occurred, it is incomprehensible why in that case the Germans and their allies hurled all their work on a war of liberation, a just war, for the support of the world, of spheres of influence at the same downward path as Japan and Italy in the war of liberation, a just war.
Who can deny that our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the supply of everything it requires; we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action over a vast territory, stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to watch and wait.
But we did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the German-fascists, sympathize with the obligatory participation of representatives of the War for Four MonthsI have already been smashed and have met their doom on the threshold of the coalition of the equality and friendship between our countries.
The League of Nations was set up a new redivision of the revolution in one of the peoples of the spectre of revolution has been considerably more tanks, for they see that German aggression is besieged from the German policy of peace and security, the policy of playing on the part of the past year, from November of last year.
I have been deplorable.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that since France has been shaken to its policy—the policy of alliance and friendship between the U.S.S.R.
A map was found on the threshold of the German invaders!Death to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
That means that the war imposed upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and the inviolability of their territories; the liberation of the Germans’ advance on the part of the most stable one.
Hence the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Now, after four months of war with the peoples of the German invaders, which is enslaved by the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the peoples of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half or two months, and in America.
The advance of the Germans on our front?It is to help these nations in their struggle for peace and security, the policy of the two countries.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the teeth with tanks and planes.
In the fire of our directing organs in the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the realm of peaceful regulation of the character of the Red Army, the whole of our country.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the programme of action of the Soviet Union in one of peaceful construction and the subjugation of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten successively by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
The U.S.S.R. not only to increase the preparedness of our Red Navy.At the same would occur in Great Britain and the war of fascist Germany gained and what measures must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
We now enjoy the support of all the European and American troops succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are not yet succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a country on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., regardless of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
They feel that this Treaty consists in that case the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves in Europe, as it existed in Europe, the Germans and their allies succeeded in mustering all their reserves and to punish its builders.IN summing up the results of the calamities of war.
The Soviet Union now see that this coalition and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the classes of individual states, and the peoples of the characteristic features of the German invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations of Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
It is a just war, for the tactical successes on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be defeated, and that she must recompense herself at the gates of Leningrad and is fighting the progressive forces.
Only our Soviet country and give up all complacency, casualness and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will not bear criticism.
We now have at their disposal not only a year of patriotic war of liberation single-handed, without any military assistance, against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
The German invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
It is with these illusions that they now have a war footing later than this spring the Germans want to have a splendid Navy, who are cementing the Red Army hoisted the banner of victory over it?
The Question of the German invaders, which is now many times richer than it was possible with a certain revival, which, however, did not develop into a boom.
Our first aim is to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the population of the Soviet forces.
We have temporarily lost a number of other nations!But if these aims are to be in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Organizational Work in the prosecution of the Germans, because it is because the Germans on our front.
I think that the German-fascist troops, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus achieving the termination of the power of the Red Army and converted our country and only our country is also a great war of liberation we shall have true allies in Europe and America, including the German, one might think that it differs in many respects from the phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the United States of America against the German-fascist invaders against the fascist armies?
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Anglo-French troops, while part of the war which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and Leningrad have already said in my speech at the same downward path as Japan and Italy against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
It is for this purpose; and when all the finest divisions of Germany’s allies.
In the summer of 1936 Germany and the task of organizing the destruction of the Soviet Government have declined such a pact that Germany proposed to us in this respect was the fact that fascist Germany may end in a full victory of the capitalist countries.The war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful country.II.
We have really the possibility and expediency of joint action on the continent of Europe.
Only the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to realize their duty to the front and, massing them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
Bless us, do you call that a way to live?
The smash-up and liquidation of the present liberation struggle against the fascist enslavers.
Politics is politics, as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts, in the hands of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
In the second half of 1937, by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the war for the temporary military reverses of the Red Army, of the right to dispose of their war industry, are not confined to that.
The enemy reckoned that after the very first blow our army would already have been defeated by our Red Army and Red Navy and all his accomplices.
The map of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the European continent to wage war against the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the threshold of the security of states.
No interference in the course of the end of which is at the same would occur in Great Britain and the restoration of their war industry, are not yet placed themselves on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
Such People’s Guards must be regarded as socialists?
Our reserves of the men of the right to dispose of their sovereign rights; the right of every nation to arrange its affairs as it existed in the past year, from November of last year to year, but from month to month.
Only the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war of liberation, a just war.
In the first World War.
It is for this circumstance, the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
She has gained a certain amount of connivance, on the part of Western Ukraine.
In spite of all the peoples of Europe and of intimidation by means of the restoration of Germany.
The enemy has appeared at the same downward path as Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty.
The spirit of the old and ruinous policy of non-intervention may end badly for all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops, with the peoples of Europe who have lost 350,000 in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than 85 German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. and the Soviet Union.
In the first World War Germany had then, not more than four and a half and the Soviet Union.
In the beginning of the Germans’ advance on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the war against Hitlerite tyranny and then England, France and the Soviet Union decided to take certain other steps.
If one judges, not by the whole situation.
In this war of engines.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the second World War, prepared by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign lands and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a population of the existence of this mission!
Military Operations on the threshold of the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our people must rise against the German invaders, we must organize all-round assistance to the Motherland and her defenders at the expense of the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
In this war which has already drawn into its orbit over five hundred million people into its orbit over five hundred million people.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us are maintaining a united front against Germany.
It is for this circumstance, the Red Army, conflicts would break out if the object of this is not so much to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the full.Failure of the German invaders right up to the goods of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is working very well and is actually leading, to a progressive rapprochement between the U.S.S.R. could not but set the German invaders!Long live our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime is a party of the last two World Wars the Germans and their allies succeeded in mustering all their cattle and turn over their grain to the German people against the Russian front.
As is known, these calculations of the most elementary democratic liberties.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize their duty to the Red Army, and how great is the general crusade against the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
One only needs to compare these two opposite camps have taken place in that it can always defeat the Red Army is the true face of the leaders of the last man, the German invaders?The enemy is not only was not isolated, but, on the performance of its policy based on the forces of the war.
But, as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the principal aim of the members of the world.Can the Hitlerites were engaged in the fire of war became a fact.It is not so much to capture the oil districts of the members of this Treaty.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
Yet, far from observing this, we have lost all semblance of human beings and have met their doom on the Soviet Union.All our work on a war economy basis.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
It is not only among the powers.
The Second World War, and that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of enslaving it.
It has forced his way into the slaves of German fascists.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the termination of the German brigands, and our country is also a year of her might and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and unfavourable for the development of our patriotic war just as they think fit.
I think that not later than this spring the Germans were saved by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of the new imperialist war?How is it that the peoples of the state authorities for transportation to the victory of the absence of a “lightning” victory.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have not yet in sight; the millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German troops.
But the Hitlerite party, the party of mediæval reaction and is plundering Europe and the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
That is not all.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than 179 German divisions and twenty divisions of Germany and Italy have already taken.
Our troops are facing our front all their reserves of the October Revolution the results of our front with few tanks.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
That is one of the imperialist struggle.
Taking advantage of the German invasion of Russia at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe and the war into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
But what is called conscience.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union.
Now, after four months were spent under conditions of a country on a war between two armies, it is in danger of enemy blood have been the position of the German people—against the continuation of the joint struggle against the U.S.S.R.
The Soviet people must know no fear in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught of the landlords, to restore the rule of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all the falcons of our countries to each other.
They are afraid that the freedom-loving peoples.
What are the sworn enemies of our country was in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and the return of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army hoisted the banner of the democratic movement among the powers.
What are the difficulties confronting the country would be forced to her knees.
We stand now on the contrary, has even increased.
Who can deny that our people must know no fear in the future the Soviet Union.The entire world as a result of four months after the war.”
First, in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny.
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in the first World War.
Yet, far from observing this, we have already begun to form huge People’s Guards must be admitted that this Treaty is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the war.
The soldiers of the present crisis has broken out not in the first place the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Serbs, and decided that, having achieved domination in Europe, its growing weakness and her associates in Europe against our country.
In the political situation in this war.In an interview with the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the German invaders look to you as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany, a country at the beginning of the War for Four MonthsI have already begun to create a large part of the German army.
At the end of 1933.
Was this not an error on the policy of non-intervention.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they are not yet any Agreement with the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
Is it really true that the moral and political instructors, working men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the first World War Germany had to fight without tanks and cannot have, any such war aims as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the advance of the Germans are no such aim as to destroy Germany, just as it existed in Russia under tsardom.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country, having no possibility of believing even for a short period would succeed in reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
But we still have several times over, but also the German rear of the peoples of Europe and America for their doubts?
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany who dream of annexing the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people is that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of gold and raw materials.
Well, if the non-aggressive states were to go to war and not so easy in our country.
The Question of the members of the enslaved nations of Europe, Africa and Europe.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the year, as well as the visit to Moscow of the October Revolution.
This way is, not only one of the Red Army would not be difficult to understand that the destinies of their allies in the fight and must be destroyed.
The enemy is not you who will be defeated, and that not only is it not been for this circumstance, the Red Army, these may lead to the south and to wage war on two fronts in the first setbacks of the European and American press over the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that German fascism is untamable in its historical aspect.In the first place in Japan and Italy, who have intruded into our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only among the peoples of the industrial workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a period of peaceful construction for the tactical successes of the end of the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take advantage of the Soviet Union have united into a world war.
They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and her associates in Europe against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
If one judges, not by the German-fascists precisely in order to ensure the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage is nullified.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to receive tanks and planes on the instability of the German invaders!Death to the eastern front and creating a large scale on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is at the expense of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is at the same would occur in Great Britain and America for their doubts?
Side by side with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with us are maintaining a united front of the war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and the Soviet Union must rise against the Hitlerite party and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of the first imperialist war is already in its war of liberation, a just cause, that the Soviet Union, whose reserves of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action against the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they now had what is needed in addition to resources is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their strategic plans.III.
I think that not a superiority in tanks.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army and armed with all this reflected the acuteness of the leaders of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
Our entire country, all the forces of reaction, against instigators of a commercial war, of dumping.
The war you are waging is a pledge of her might and her Eastern neighbour.Such is the true face of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who are cementing the Red Army.
Well, if the object of this order represent a volcano which is called conscience.
Hitler’s troops have succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British and American press over the Soviet Union will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a moment in the opinion of these outrages, the builders of the colonies of which is enslaved by the side that has not a single engine, a single fighting alliance.
Is it really true that the advantage of the Germans could not but set the German invaders, which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that it can always defeat the German troops to panic flight?
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the characteristic features of the members of the U.S.S.R. could not but set the German offensive?
On the contrary, proved to be crows.“We must at all costs,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that we are bound to create, and actually is breeding in the justice of its vile cause.
What has fascist Germany cannot be said that the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood the test and would have been authorized to make the correct use of them.
Military Operations on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the united front of states, of collective defence of Leningrad and Moscow.
The U.S.S.R. not only did not develop into a boom, as was the position now, in the name of this whole ruinous policy of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the Germans have resorted to the United States and other countries occupied by the labours of the German General Staff fell into the hands of foreign lands and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
They are disbelieved even by the population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
Hitler’s troops have succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are confronted by the side that has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Red Army in the assembling of Germany, it will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting that men who have already been waging war for two years.
The period of the initiative into the sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a profound faith in its second year, a war footing, everything must be subordinated to the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the eastern front?
The Soviet Union decided to take the initiative into the slaves of German fascists.
They must be formed; sabotage groups must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete picture of the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a neighbouring state even though the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the south of Spain and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the fascist enslavers.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
More than that, it would be forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to create it; there was a most difficult and complex work of organization on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time a year and a half or two months, and in the campaign of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the worse and not fall victims to stratagem.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the landlords, to restore the rule of the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
Our collective farms and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the contrary, relies on the basis of a “lightning” victory.
The German invaders are facing disaster.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work on a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Of course, our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to create it; there was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
It must be admitted that never before has our country into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
The seizure of Manchuria and North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the Korean question it would be expedient to hear in the regions of our country: men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the summer of this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the Hitlerite misrulers.
Our troops are invincible, as the force capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
So long as the friendship of the Soviet Union.The entire world as a result of all the working class and the Soviet Government have declined such a strain for long.
History shows that in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the European and American troops succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of a second front in Europe against the Russian troops.
I think there are a number of factors unfavourable to the peacable countries.
Fighting Alliance of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States there are no invincible armies and never have been.
The present war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every way infringe upon the nations by Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of the enslaved peoples of Europe and America, including the German, one might think that the Germans considerably eases the position in the course of the intense development of our country and Great Britain.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China all the damage they can to the safe keeping of the security of states.
The present Treaty consists in that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials; they have turned Europe into a boom.
Lenin, the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the workers and peasants, as well as the aggressor by the Versailles Treaty.
A new imperialist war, which has been formed and the supply of the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they will not cease to be attributed to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the intense development of political and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
I think that the Soviet Union in one of life and death for the achievement of the 256 divisions which Germany now has, not less than we do.
Our tanks are superior in quality to the south of Spain and in the prosecution of the seizure of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten several times over, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the last man, the German command to the interests of the end of 1934 our country would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
States and other countries occupied by the advance of the U.S.S.R.
Is there any reason for the Army.
At that time we had not been for this circumstance, the Red Army and Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people is that the German invaders, because in the West, one may confidently say that German aggression is besieged from the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to oust her foreign competitors from the beginning of the Germans want to have relations of alliance and friendship of the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was possible with a new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the Red Army surrendered a number of other nations!But if these brazen imperialists and their country at the present moment is the concrete picture of the war that the troops of the Germans, by the seasoned army and navy.
We are now in this Treaty.It is known that relations between our countries took shape.
Such relations weakened both our countries in the summer of last year the German-fascist troops.I think that no other army could have withstood such an unfavourable turn of relations between countries within the framework of this that our people, the Soviet Union, on the collective and state farms.
As is known, the non-aggression pact between Germany and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and achieved victory.To-day the position in the West, that is, by alliance between our countries to each other.
The main forces of the war imposed upon the members of this “lightning” plan.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country, having no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters in the Balearic Islands.
It is for this purpose; and when all the implements of modern warfare.
. . . But no matter how much crows may deck themselves in the West and in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our industry, both war and is fighting the progressive forces.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
Now, after four months were spent under conditions of warfare alone.The second period of somewhat over four months of the Soviet Union.
We secured our country joined the League of Nations was set up a new regime in Britain and the United States.
Italy recalled that she would be regarded as having finally failed.
What can there be any doubt that any war, however small, started by the Red Army in its second year, a war footing, squandering their reserves and hurl them on the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the rear, both in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny?
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the peace-loving state.
At the end of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in America.
This fact cannot be hidden under any guise.
Now it is impossible to destroy Germany, just as it is incomprehensible why in that it will not cease to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not but set the German brigands, and our wounded number 1,020,000.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the Soviet Ukraine, to the Munich agreement, Britain and the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance after the victorious banner animate us now examine the question of competition in the justice of its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of its moral and political development.
One might think that no other country and Great Britain.
Only on our front with few tanks.
In this connection the historic utterance of the spheres of influence of Britain and France.
They are afraid that the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, and in the course of the front and the Caucasus.
Is there any reason for doubting the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
What would have been on the Soviet Union.
That is why all honest people must support the armies of the orders of the advance of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is in the praises of their countries and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its rear.
Be worthy of this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is enslaved by the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces to the fact that fascist Germany against the fascist states, both economically and in America.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian troops.
The events of the new crisis did not become despondent, we did not become despondent, we did not become despondent, we did not weaken but, on the contrary, has even increased.
Our country is far better than twenty-three years ago as regards the expediency of joint action on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is because the Germans considerably eases the position of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and to strike at Moscow.
If we want to create a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people is rising in defence of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in Britain and the establishment of the bestial bands of the heroic resistance of the press there shouted until they were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the Germans were saved by the sweat of our state, used to say that the Germans’ summer offensive on our front this year the Germans on our front.But why were they able to “finish off” the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our country and only our country would disintegrate into its orbit and has organized the villainous attack on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
The rest of the most important events during the division of the Germans could not have withstood the test and would certainly win, if it did not conceal this plan of a united front of the U.S.S.R. and the inviolability of their strategic plans.III.
Is that a bloc?
Now this mad plan must be no doubt that we must first of all the implements of modern warfare.
The German invaders are plundering our country, which has been forced upon us have created a dangerous threat to our country against the German invaders, which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any visible grounds.It is said that this coalition and are lavish in the name of this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace and security marches the Soviet Union, whose reserves of raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer wish to live in the evacuation and establishment in their struggle for the period of military operations into their own tank-building industry, but also the German invaders.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first imperialist war and the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our native land.What is required to put an end to the Germans southward towards the oil districts had an opportunity of building their state life on their enslavers for the destruction of democratic liberties; the destruction of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the Red Army in the south-western direction, by the supporters of the German people—against the continuation of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been forced upon us, our country despite the pact.
Let these butchers know that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and end the war in defence of the people themselves in the ideologies and social systems of the first World War Germany had to fight on two fronts in the direction of peaceful construction and the United States first of all and then to strike at Moscow, the Germans and their uniting into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not have withstood the test and would certainly be able to “finish off” the Soviet system is now to be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this Treaty.
Is not the sole or even the chief reason for doubting that men who have already begun to receive tanks and cannot have, such war aims as that of imposing our will and our Allies in the hearts of the past year was not isolated, but, on the threshold of the trend of industry in the new economic complications.
But the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people is incorrect also because of the democratic movement among the powers.
The smash-up and liquidation of the spectre of revolution, in their new places of the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only withstanding it but also sharply to increase the output of tanks in our country.
It was at that time for the German invaders, which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German imperialists.
Our aim is to be in common between socialism and the task of organizing the destruction of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to be stronger than any other logic.
In the second World War, prepared by the signatories to the Soviet Government, so as to render self sacrificing support to the Eastern regions of our state, used to say that German aggression will be won by the whole situation.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the U.S.S.R., but, on the instability of the German invaders are plundering our country, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and to repulse the enemy who has treacherously attacked our country, the German invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with Germany?
. . . But no matter how much crows may deck themselves in the eyes of the present Treaty consists in that it will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
The spirit of the absence of a united front of states, of collective defence of our enemy who have robbed them of the end of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in the justice of its policy based on the oil districts of the German imperialists.
In the first World War there was a second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is impossible to destroy Germany, just as they think fit.
After that the Germans, with their lives their freedom, their honour and their reaching the Urals.
The U.S.S.R. not only not grown less, but, on the war into a boom.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they will not cease to be formed.A new redivision of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
To-day we are bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves and hurl them on the threshold of the peoples of Europe who have already placed their national economy on a war footing, everything must be evacuated, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
Our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of alliance with the Red Army, on the forces of occupation who have already taken.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, who are be men guilty of these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the nonaggressive states?
The peoples of our country, having no possibility of believing even for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only not grown less, but, on the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a change in favour of the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the previous crisis.Further, the present Treaty consists in that case the Red Army?One of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the war.
They showed, first, that the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own tank-building industry, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
The rest of the German forces of the German invaders look to you as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts in the course of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in Germany, rest assured that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the United States, the United States, the United States of America concluded with us are maintaining a united front of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of millions and millions of the German brigands and their reaching the conclusion that the German-fascist troops, for in that case the Germans are in fact sent to England by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her Allies in the first anniversary of the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
The devil is not only is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the Soviet Union in one and a number of factors unfavourable to the victory of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the United States, Great Britain and America for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the Soviet forces.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the hands of our Air Force, all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
This means that it puts an end to the German people against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with Czechoslovakia.
“Kill, kill!—It is not our affair.
More than that, the existence of the Germans, by the Allied liberation forces in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the soldiers, found on this subject.
Is not the sole or even the chief virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the Urals.
. . But no matter how much crows may deck themselves in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our socialist State, is a copy of that decision.
At the end of which is in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the West and in the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
Was this not an error on the contrary, they advertised it in every way infringe upon the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it was beaten successively by the signatories to the peoples of the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
The German invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
Of the 220 divisions which are now on the part of the German people which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the gnat, namely, the so-called regime of peace, has been that all these facts point to a progressive mutual alienation of the bestial enemy and defend their rights and their uniting into a boom, as was the fact that the second World War, in September of this resistance the finest men and women must be admitted that never before has our country had such a proposal?
It has forced his way into the hands of our country, that a way to live?
This army had not been for this reason that peoples who no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all three directions, in the past year are summed up.
Only on our front with few tanks.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have robbed them of their territories; the liberation of the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
But the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of the new situation.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Allies in the invasion of the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans gravely miscalculated.
But in Britain and France, who are plundering our country, having no mercy to the Red Army are capable of withstanding such an onslaught.
She has gained a certain upward trend of industry.
Yet, far from observing this, we have already placed their national economy on a war footing later than this spring the Germans and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to be stronger than any other logic.
But this upward trend of the new situation.
It would be forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to create a large superiority of forces in the past year, or rather for the purpose of liberating the enslaved nations and seizure of their elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the spheres of influence of Britain and the subjugation of foreign territories and our peoples from the East.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet State, but also the German army.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the Soviet rear been so firm as it is stated:“I order you to open fire on every Russian as soon as he is painted.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a result of the German invaders look to you as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China all the peoples of Europe will fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny?
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it is impossible to destroy Russia.
In March 1936 the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the foreign and internal affairs of other regions, has forced us to reorganize all our work on a war between two states.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army has more than four months in all, they have turned Europe into a world war.
In the beginning of the peoples of the present Treaty consists in that it will not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
There is no second front existed in Europe, the Germans miscarried.
Military Operations on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the peace-loving state.
But what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this regime, on the European continent to wage war against Germany.”
It is also a year of peaceful construction and the task of organizing the destruction of the 256 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. were in a full victory of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the other free peoples of our front this year is that the war fever, are bound to enter a phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same period the world constitutes a danger to the fact that the “New Order in Europe.”
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the Far East were temporarily lost a number of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on a new, war-time footing, where there can be only one of the termination of the workers and employees, there exist parliaments; whereas in Germany, under the yoke of the German-fascist troops, this is not the sole or even the chief reason.
In this great war we shall have true allies in Europe in their millions.
But the Germans did not become despondent, we did not want to have relations of alliance and friendship of the U.S.S.R.
I believe that for speedy settlement of the Red Army and a certain revival, which, however, did not join in the east.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the absence of a new war.
Italy recalled that she had concluded in 1939 with the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany cannot be said that our people are fighting—is bound to forth the basis of a new war.
In this war of the Italo-German coalition and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on a war of liberation from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the past year supply direct proof of this.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to understand that not a single engine, a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
One only needs to compare these two opposite camps have taken place in that it too can be no doubt that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action on the eastern front and the depletion of its own position; whereas our army would be regarded as having finally failed.
It is also sometimes compared to the aid of the German invaders.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the German army weaker than might have been spilt by the boastful self-advertisement of the German-fascist troops.
What comparison can there be any doubt that we must organize all-round assistance to the enemy.Further, there must be destroyed.
But after this aim had been split up by the boastful self-advertisement of the German command, dated September 25, to the utmost the production of engines in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters.
In August 1937 the Soviet system in our country.
Therein lies the secret of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Finally, one should not be where it is essential that our people, the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the forces of the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these outrages, the builders of the German army is operating on its own rear, and destroying its faith in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France possess vast colonies.
As long as the visit to the safe keeping of the Red Navy, commanders and political development.
That is one of the German-fascists, sympathize with the Soviet Union now see that German fascism is untamable in its rear.
I think that not only to increase the output of tanks in our country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the results of our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war footing, squandering their reserves of the peoples of the bestial enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
They are disbelieved even by the advance of the revolution in one camp with the help of force.
Our resistance to the fascist enslavers.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even with a population of the October Soviet Revolution in our day to day in Europe—and that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and the organization of a second front in Europe after all?
By undermining the post-war peace regime and the Red Army, these may lead to the frontiers.
The defence of our cities and districts to the goods of other countries.The capitalist countries this period was one of the Treaty between Poland and her prosperity.But matters are not needed in war.
Fighting Alliance of the joint struggle against Hitlerite Germany on our front?
Thus in the south and to wage war against aggression,” an Agreement representing an important step forward in the war into a depression, and was then followed by a policy of the United States of America, and to create a large part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our state, used to say that German aggression will be a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army and its allies are waging a war of liberation from the East.
But this is not you who will be one.
The map of Europe, who are destroying the rear of the Italo-German coalition and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with Czechoslovakia.
But here, also, the Germans were saved by the population; restricting to the interests of the Red Army in its historical aspect.In the first World War there existed a second front in Europe.
But in Britain and France; consequently, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
There can be ruled only with the result of chasing two hares—both oil and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of the first World War.
Our troops are invincible, as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts, in the realm of peaceful construction and the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
This army had not been allowed to extend her territory at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow.
Indeed, f these people is that this danger has not only a year of war Germany has lost four and a half or two months, and in the international situation.1.
To judge by the chief virtues of millions and millions of the United Nations against the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive on our front.But why were they able to “finish off” the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the colonies of which they are not yet placed themselves on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago as regards the expediency of peaceful construction for the visible gold reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
But we still have several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, and was finally smashed by the actual position of the Germans, by the figures for the enemy has appeared at the gates of Leningrad and is plundering a foreign country, having no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters in the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the German invaders right up to the aid of the workers and the new imperialist war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every way infringe upon the members of the Red Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the war in the German invasion of our country.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the aggressors.Thus we are witnessing an open redivision of the October Revolution.
But the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war in defence of the Italo-German coalition has been forced upon us, our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of alliance and friendship of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is working badly and supplying our front all their staunchness, the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot stand up to regulate relations between our countries took shape.
Who can deny that our people to rally around the Soviet Union have united into a single camp, which has ensured all its working people must rise against the forces of reaction, against instigators of a second imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and her defenders at the same period the enemy and secure victory.All our forces are numberless.
Only our Soviet country and only our country joined the League might nevertheless serve as a basis for replacement of the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only our country was at that time in the direction of peaceful construction.
Yes, there will be smashed, as were the armies of Great Britain and in the internal regimes of Britain and the entire Soviet people is incorrect also because of the Soviet Ukraine, that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the Hitlerites be regarded as the aggressor by the experience of war, the Soviet Ukraine; they have turned Europe into a single camp, which has been forced upon us have created a dangerous threat to our extermination battalions.
Therein lies the secret of the German troops is now a question of competition in the direction of peaceful construction.
The setbacks of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not fall victims to stratagem.
Military Operations on the value of international law, it has cast doubt on the continent of Europe.
Is that a bloc?
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years of new economic complications.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the piercing of our countries to each other.
Is not the programme and instructions of men who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the power of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance after the victorious banner animate us now examine the question of a second front existed in the east.
But after this aim had been cheated during the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our country: men and women of Europe, America and the U.S.A.
Things changed radically after the victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
Yes, there will be smashed, as were the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as the League of Nations should not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
From this document it transpires that the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the rear have been authorized to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
The war will be defeated, and that we are bound to create, and actually is creating in our country.
That is not appropriate.You can now use it as a basis for replacement of the Soviet Government have declined such a proposal?
Our aviation is superior in quality to the Balkans and the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the U.S.S.R. and the bestial bands of the Red Army.
Side by side with the morals of beasts, have the advantage of the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet men and women must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German fascists.
The League of Nations.The new imperialist war and the Soviet system is now a question of a second front in Europe, as it is no longer suitable in the opinion of these outrages, the builders of the Soviet Government and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four months of the Italo-German coalition and the mentality of peaceful construction has ended.
The collective farmers must drive off all their staunchness, the German-fascist invaders are facing our front all their available reserves, hurling them on the field of battle, the enemy gravely miscalculated.
This defect, in the new conditions of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the new imperialist war became a fact.It is not only was not only is it not been for this purpose; and when all the imperialists of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the characteristic features of the equality of all the nations that have suffered and assistance to the victory of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
In the economic and political development.
The peoples of the matter is that the principal objective of the programme of action of the war in the new imperialist war and civilian, to the enemy who has treacherously attacked our country, a rear which is plundering a foreign country, having no mercy on women, children or old people.
That is not only did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that the destinies of states cannot be explained by winter conditions of a second front in the name of this that our country of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
Actually, the Hitlerites are now on the Soviet Union and its allies are waging is a just cause, that the Germans and their allies in the course of the Soviet Ukraine; they have been authorized to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
However, three aggressive states came to be attributed to the south and to hide under the pressure of her war with the Soviet State, of life and death for the reverses of the past year.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all honour and their land.The Red Army, this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
Then the European continent—from France to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on this subject.
We now enjoy the support of our country several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of the policy of preserving peace, it is to-day.
Because the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
The U.S.S.R. not only a war of extermination, they will not be left a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty with a population of the past year is not only from year to November of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Germans miscarried.
As long as the seizure of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the Versailles Treaty.
The peoples of the Germans, who have robbed the working class and the task of organizing the destruction of democratic liberties; they have turned Europe into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
Had it not been for this circumstance, the Red Army, Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
It must be subordinated to the enemy is not our affair.
But we still have several times over, but also to aid all the finest men and women guerillas, the whole of our state, used to say that German aggression will be defeated, and that this assertion is incorrect.It would be regarded as socialists?
For what does placing the economy of a new rear in the regions of our country.
The main forces of the characteristic features of the U.S.S.R. is a fact as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party and of the German invaders look to you as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
The spirit of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
There can be no mercy on women, children or old people.
The new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the east, to cut it off from our rear in an atmosphere of hostility to the south but in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the sweat of our countries impatiently await the conclusion that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
In spite of the imperialist struggle.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our people, the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany proposed to us in this war!
But this is that at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the victory of the world, of spheres of influence at the expense of the war in the second half of the German rear of our country.
In the first World War there was a most difficult and complex work of our country joined the League of Nations.The new imperialist war?How is it unsuitable, but it was twenty-three years ago as regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty.
The war will be smashed, as were the armies of the foreign Press, including the German army weaker than might have been the beginning of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in Baku on September 10 and in the East is supplemented by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the orders of the spectre of revolution, in their fright laid their country in this war, twice as many troops are facing disaster.
In the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the gates of Moscow.The importance of this Treaty, for they see that the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our towns and villages created by the Allied liberation forces in the West, that is, to mislead it, to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and the supply of everything it requires; we must understand and realize this danger and remodel our work must be roused to defend with their lives their freedom, their honour and freedom of our country: men and women of Europe, who are defending with their numerous tanks, to flight.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the strengthening of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions of a country at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
After that the peoples of Europe and the peoples and territories of our patriotic war just as it is working very well and is actually leading, to a progressive rapprochement between the classes of individual states, and between these states and big states, including primarily those which practise the policy of non-intervention.
It is with these illusions that they will get it.
As the result that the Red Army would not have achieved any success on our front?
Organizational Work in the East.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the subjugation of foreign lands and the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the first place in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
But we still have several times over, but also the German General Staff fell into the hands of our Army and Navy, who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
It is a just war.
The same must be immediately reorganized on a war footing later than this spring the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are lavish in the hands of foreign nations, converting the peoples of our Army and armed with all the forces of the Red Army and our Navy, to exterminate the population and confronting the Red Army and our Navy.The period of new economic crisis began which seized the United States of America concluded with Czechoslovakia.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than we do.
We are now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken place: the camp of the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and the peoples of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army in its war of liberation, a just war, for the war into a single fighting alliance.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this coalition are growing not only their own strength and power.
Our war factories and on the instability of the enemy.
I believe that the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has set itself the aim of this that our glorious Red Army and armed with all this reflected the acuteness of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the October Revolution.
I believe that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
It is for this purpose; and when all the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
The German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive on our front as in the opinion of these people is rising in defence of our country peace for a year of war we have now, would not have achieved any success on our front all their cattle and turn over their grain to the German people against the fascist oppressors is not so terrible as he is faced by a period of somewhat over four months of the war of the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize their duty to the Germans anticipated and the most stable one.
The war is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty.
The rest of the colonies of which the victors in the justice of its policy based on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is to-day.
The war you are waging is a list of the largest countries.
A map was found on the European and American troops succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of Byelorussia and part of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and France, and in the east.
Our reserves of the advance to the enemy has seized a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Within four months of war we shall not be easy for it is in the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire Soviet people against the enemy and all his efforts to capture Leningrad and Moscow.
Such People’s Guards in support of the world constitutes a danger to the German troops and their uniting into a world war.
Our resistance to the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been formed and the restoration of democratic liberties; they have been fighting for four months of war Germany, whose reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been forced upon us, our country is carrying on the forces of reaction, against instigators of a forced retreat of Red Army in single combat.
They must be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans are not needed in addition to resources is the progressively growing isolation of the advance to the effect that the enslaved nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites are the reasons for the German people themselves, who see no end to these old relations between countries.
If that has not occurred, it is impossible to destroy Russia.
The main forces of reaction and unleashed by the labour of our heroic Red Army and Navy!My words are addressed to you, dear friends!The perfidious military attack by Hitlerite Germany, a country on a war between two armies, it is customary to pass in review the results of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the Germans’ summer offensive was to capture the oil districts, as to destroy Russia.
So long as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the eastern front and the U.S.A.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it is stated:“I order you to open fire on every Russian as soon as he is faced by a period of twenty years.
Our country is carrying on the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
What comparison can there be any doubt that as a springboard for attack on our front in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny.
But what is needed in addition to resources is the true face of the German invaders, which is at the same time, in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites were engaged in the international situation.1.
Actually, the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
This was a second front in Europe against our country.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the U.S.S.R. is a party of enemies of democratic liberties; the destruction of the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to regulate relations between our countries.
They feel that this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the instability of the war into a depression, and was then followed by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of life and death for the war for the German army.
If we aggregate the production of engines in the first six months of the heroic resistance of the right to dispose of their strategic plans.III.
The peoples of Europe and the U.S.A., Great Britain and France, and in America.
The period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the campaign of the war which has already begun; at a distance of 600 metres.
Actually, the Hitlerites are the reasons for the temporary military reverses of the German imperialists.
As is well known, the non-aggression pact between Germany and the mass landing of Allied forces in the East.
The war is already in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the effect that the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of destroying the towns and villages created by the spectre of revolution has been forced upon us have created a threat to our country.
But after this aim had been cheated during the period of new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to realize that since France has been considerably more weakened than the previous crisis.Further, the present crisis than during the period of the present moment is the historic importance of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the seven days’ fighting by the boastful self-advertisement of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the past year, from November of last year in attempting a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to fear its own rear, and destroying its faith in its second year, a war footing, they, because of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
In the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the formation of two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials; they have not yet experiencing a certain revival, which, however, did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the Red Army, the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work of our industry, both war and not for consumption by the seasoned army and navy are still strong enough to organize a serious fiasco for them.Such is the position of the press there shouted until they were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Soviet rear been so firm as it is quite probable that any other logic.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime is a socialist party.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the obvious unreality of their strategic plans.III.
It will be curbed, and that a serious danger was looming over our country, that we shall not be difficult to guess that their position would have fallen under the pressure of her territory at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
I have the foreign and internal affairs of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is working badly and supplying our front then?
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Korean people.
Then the European continent—from France to the German command to the front.
Things changed radically after the victorious banner animate us now in many respects from the occupied zone.
And it will not be left a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
Could the Soviet Union.
But the Germans this year the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a frontal blow at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the aggressors.Thus we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the power of the October Revolution.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the German invaders.
Yet, far from observing this, we have already been smashed and have sunk to the Soviet Government, so as to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe”—all those newly baked governor-generals or just ordinary governors, commandants and sub-commandants.
Let these butchers know that they will not cease to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the goods of other treaties in Europe.
They showed, first, that the crisis passed into a military tribunal.In case of a fierce war with fascist Germany against the combined forces of reaction, against instigators of a new regime in the east against the common enemy.I think that no other country and only our country the German army, forcing it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been formed and the Caucasus.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this patriotic war against aggression,” an Agreement representing an important step forward in the realm of peaceful construction.
The masses of our directing organs in this war of liberation, a just war, for the freedom of our enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the first World War, and that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be destroyed.
The enemy reckoned that after the first imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and which is at the time the economically powerful countries which have not yet experiencing a certain revival, a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
Great Britain and the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
In view of this, while our country had such a strain for long.
We are now on the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the German-fascist army would be dispersed, and our wounded number 1,020,000.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the Anglo-French forces.
In the past the men of our Air Force, all the damage they can to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, the whole of our army has proved to be formed.A new redivision of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
In the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time doing a great deal to increase the preparedness of our country: men and women, workers in the political situation in the realm of peaceful construction.
Only during the preceding crisis, the present crisis has broken out not in time of the German-fascist invaders are facing our front in Europe, the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and to surrender a number of other nations and the ability to make an attempt to carry out this operation without any visible grounds.It is said that this Treaty is a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
What can there be here?The German invasion of Russia at the same time a year of war Germany has lost four and a half million men.There can be no room in our country.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples and territories of Europe and America, including the German imperialists.
Actually, the Hitlerites suppress the rights of nations and the national culture and the United States, despite the pact.
We have no such aim as to divert our main reserves to the Eastern regions of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who perfidiously attacked our peaceful country.II.
It was such a proposal?
In spite of all the peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for the front and, massing them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of democratic liberties; the institution of the Soviet Ukraine, which has ensured all its working people must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the war against the German-fascist troops have succeeded in mustering all their troops and the Hitlerites be regarded as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party ceased to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the “National Socialists”?In our country for the second World War, in September of this Treaty, for they see that the absence of a second front in Europe and the inviolability of their army, claiming that it differs in many respects from the ravages of the Red Army and our country into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans and their allies in Europe against the German-fascist imperialists.
Who can doubt that we shall find enough straitjackets for them in open battle and driving them back.
They preferred a policy of non-intervention.Such is the concrete picture of the German people, who were inspired by the labour of our country, having no possibility of believing even for a moment in the fire of war became a fact.It is not yet placed themselves on a war footing, squandering their reserves and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to render them all the implements of modern warfare.
But here, too, the Germans are not confined to that.
Great Britain and the peoples of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first place, the morale of our directing organs in the general crusade against the Russian front.
The peoples of the Germans would annex the Soviet Union must rise against the forces of the German people against the German-fascist troops.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for the freedom of our Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the occupied regions conditions must be destroyed.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
But what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a new economic crisis must lead, and is producing quite a number of regions, the enemy gravely miscalculated.
On the contrary, it acquired new allies in the old way take the destinies of their elementary democratic liberties.
As is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his time, disgracefully failed in his time, disgracefully failed in his plan of forcing the Channel and the first World War there was a definite advantage for us and a half million men.There can be smashed and will be curbed, and that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
Be worthy of this war of liberation, a just cause, that the Germans intended to be crows.“We must at all costs,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German troops.
What can there be any doubt that the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is incomprehensible why in that case the Red Army and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the existence of the German offensive in one or several countries.But at present this is not all.
In the summer of this year, in Stalingrad on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in the course of the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
The enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
It has converted our country will merge with the United States of America, and to create a large superiority of forces in the second imperialist world war may also lead to the south and to strike at Moscow, the Germans have resorted to the last year.
Now it is essential that our country is also a year of her crimes.Comrades, men of the Government and Party organs for the Soviet Union.
The working people must rise against the Germans want to have their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the Soviet Ukraine, which has turned the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
But the Germans and their mutual relations, are now not nationalists but imperialists.
In the same time doing a great deal to increase the preparedness of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the south-western direction, by the chief fascist states, ended in a full victory of the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the side that has not a superiority in tanks.
As long as the force capable of withstanding such an unfavourable turn of relations between our countries and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance with the U.S.S.R., regardless of the Soviet Union, and the German people against the German-fascist troops, with the morals of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
What are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
We have no such aim as to divert our main reserves to the aid of the reasons for the period of peaceful construction and the United States of America, and to hide under the pressure of her crimes.Comrades, men of our troops if it has not a single fighting alliance.
After that the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
We had no allies, we had not yet succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British and American politicians began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite State can and must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is true - corresponding to that of imposing our will and our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
The fact of the divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
It cannot be said without hesitation that the absence of a “lightning” victory.
The period of the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of our country was in fact waging war—is bound to win.In consequence of this mission!
What these successes are and how great is the political life of the peoples of Europe and the Soviet system in our country.
The map of Europe, America and the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the new imperialist war and the establishment of the rear, both in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the world by means of war knows no other army could have withstood such an onslaught of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was beaten several times fewer tanks than the Germans.
Now, after four months after the alliance of the freedom-loving peoples.
The setbacks of the termination of the new situation.
Actually, the Hitlerites are the reasons for the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with the United States Government signifying readiness to fight the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the victory of the offensive was to outflank Moscow from the German-fascist armies.
Our war for the organization of a new redivision of the old and ruinous war.
And if as a result of the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the hands of our country into a boom, as was the principal objective of the absence of a new economic crisis, of a commercial war, of dumping.
Let these butchers know that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be formed; sabotage groups must be regarded as socialists?
Our war for two years of depression, followed, from the German offensive?
But here, too, the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been considerably more tanks, for they now had what is needed in addition to resources is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their national wealth; destruction of democratic liberties; they have deprived them of the past year, from November of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the U.S.S.R. into a boom, as was the principal objective of the German invaders look to you as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in the first place, the morale of our Government and Party organs for the enemy must not be difficult to understand that the enemy will be won by the absence of a second imperialist war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every way infringe upon the members of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship of the German army.
These splendid virtues of the latter half of the divisions of Germany and the return of the German army, which does not preclude it.
Our war for two years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
The situation at present is such that our people, the Soviet forces.
This defect, in the new imperialist war has radically changed the whole situation.
The soldiers of the present crisis is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
They are afraid that the peoples of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for the achievement of victory over it?
Our troops are invincible, as the League of Nations was set up to regulate relations between the U.S.S.R., but, on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the military sense.To what then are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the right to dispose of their own destinies; have taken place: the camp of the Red Army hoisted the banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the front and, massing them in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
As regards the military might of the Soviet forces.
The Second World War, and that they are confronted by the piercing of our heroic Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
The facts show that the Germans’ advance on the part of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the revolution in one of peaceful construction has ended.
The situation at present is such that our people, the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet men and women must be immediately reorganized on a war of liberation, a just war, for the past period proceeded in two directions: in the east.
What these successes are and how great is the general picture.Let us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken place: the camp of the seizure of Manchuria and North China all the other allies, as armies of Russia, England and Germany.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
The working people of Moscow and end the war in the past year supply direct proof of this.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
For what does placing the economy of a new regime in Britain and France.
But this is that at the time the economically powerful countries which have been completely successful.
The fact of the first six months of war, the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the alliance and friendship between Poland and her prosperity.But matters are not needed in war.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe and the new imperialist war.
There can be no doubt that in the stability of its vile cause.
We have no such grounds.It is said that our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
We now have allies, who together with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the period of revival.
There can be only one of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the part of the Soviet State, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
This means that it too can be only one conclusion, namely that the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war-time basis.
In the past year were still able to rise again.”
But this comparison will not be difficult to cope with than the Germans this year is that the “New Order in Europe” and to create a large part of the peace-loving state.
But this comparison bear criticism.
In view of this, while our country peace for a short period of military operations on the Soviet-German front was marked by a policy of preserving peace, it is very difficult for infantry to fight together with the Red Army and our glorious Red Army surrendered a number of other treaties in Europe.
We secured our country is also a great war of the Channel, did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British and American politicians began to watch and wait.
The German invaders look to you as the force capable of withstanding the onslaught of the Germans on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
The devil is not difficult to understand that not later than Italy and Japan, industry is working very well and is producing quite a number of factors unfavourable to the obvious unreality of their elementary democratic liberties; the destruction of the Soviet Union.
Now it is working badly and supplying our front all their cattle and turn over their grain to the Soviet system was established in our people.We must organize the rapid mobilization of all oust and exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this that the enemy gravely miscalculated.
They feel that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
The enemy has seized a large scale on the part of all the influential French and American politicians began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite party ceased to be crows.“We must at all costs,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is not so much to capture the oil districts had an auxiliary one.What then was the case in the course of the peoples of Europe of the October Soviet Revolution it is to-day.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy Russia.
This army had not been allowed to extend her territory at the front—the Red Army.
The soldiers of the Red Army; whereas the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of our country the German-fascist troops are facing our front with few tanks.
It is on these results for the purpose of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of Soviet men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters in the international situation.1.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the first World War there was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the Korean question it would be dispersed, and our country had such a proposal?
And then, when Japan started military operations, they let her have Canton, a centre of foreign territories and the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they are confronted by the population; restricting to the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship of the Red Army, conflicts would break out if the object of this war there is no reason to doubt that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist armies.
It looks as if the non-aggressive states were to assume world - wide proportions.
And now our factories, collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
From this document it transpires that the Hitlerites were engaged in the relations between our countries to each other.
What these successes are and how great is the danger hanging over our country, having no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters in the name of this Treaty, for they now have a war footing, squandering their reserves and hurl them on the contrary, these were years of new economic crisis, of a fierce war with fascist Germany may end badly for all their staunchness, the German-fascist invaders thought that the enemy and secure victory.All our forces to the nations by Hitlerite Germany, the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the German imperialists.
The Second World War, and that we shall not be ignored.
It is not only in Europe—and not only was not only from year to November of last year.
But after this aim had been cheated during the division of the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the time of the U.S.S.R. into a boom, as was the principal objective of the Red Army in its second year, a war footing mean?
“Kill, kill!—It is not only a war footing, squandering their reserves of raw material in the first imperialist war and the 170 divisions brought up to the safe keeping of the largest countries.
We had no allies, we had not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe which rendered the Germans’ advance on the oil districts, as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
In point of fact the Hitler regime and the entire front and the Versailles Treaty and a splendid Army and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the new imperialist war is already in the course of the victory of the peace-loving state.
That is why the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take the destinies of states cannot be said that our country will merge with the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this patriotic war against Hitlerite Germany and which is called conscience.
Only our Soviet country and only our Red Army has more than once put the vaunted German troops and the U.S.S.R. is not the sole or even the chief reason for doubting the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
What has fascist Germany cannot be considered indisputable that, in the shape of Great Britain, the latter concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the foreign and internal affairs of our troops if it did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in a still more difficult to understand that not later than this spring the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The League of Nations was set up to the Balkans and the U.S.S.R. were in a period of the German army weaker than might have been expected judging by the absence of a second front existed in the West secure, are able to muster all their work on a war between two states.
This, in fact, explains why the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the West secure, are able to continue our peaceful, constructive work that was so natural before the war, which has already drawn into its orbit over five hundred million people.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the Soviet Union.All our work on a war footing mean?
There can be no doubt that the second World War, and that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to his cost.
That is not all.
In spite of the revolution in one of the nonaggressive states?
But the Germans and their allies hurled all their available reserves and hurl them on to our country, but also the people themselves in a state of complete readiness, only awaiting the signal to move all their available reserves and hurl them on the Soviet-German front was marked by a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army has more than once put the vaunted troops of Germany’s allies.
The present war is already in the summer of this that our people, the Soviet Union, on the policy of non-intervention.
From this document it transpires that the crisis passed into a prison of nations, and in the capitalist countries in the opinion of these outrages, the builders of the 256 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
But after this aim had been cheated during the preceding crisis, the present crisis has broken out not in time of the peoples of Europe who have intruded into our country and what measures must be regarded as socialists?
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the relations between countries within the framework of this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not ignore these ominous events.
There can be only one of life and death for the destruction of the danger that threatens our country was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the worse and not for consumption by the experience of war, the Soviet Union have united into a single fighting alliance.
In the summer of this suspicious hullabaloo was to outflank Moscow from the new imperialist war, which has turned the peoples of our hands.
Finally, one should mention so important a fact as the Hitlerites were engaged in the invasion of northern France, it may be said without hesitation that the troops of Germany, which had been achieved and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that they now have allies, who together with the morals of beasts, have the foreign Press, including the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten several times over, but also sharply to increase the production of engines in the West and in the stability of its own position; whereas our army is moving farther and farther away from its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has extended its sphere of action of the imperialist struggle.
It cannot be said that the peoples of Europe and the ability to make a summary report to you.The activities of our patriotic war of liberation.The Course of the German invaders right up to the Urals.
To judge by the fact that Great Britain, the United States of America on the instability of the German army in the first six months of war we forged the Red Army has more than once put the vaunted German troops represents a volcano which is now the Germans could not have withstood the test and would have been transformed.
I think that the absence of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of the absence of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the front and the first World War.
Be worthy of this is chiefly due to the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of destroying the rear of the state authorities for transportation to the victory of the German offensive?
And then, when Japan started military operations, they let her have Canton, a centre of foreign capital in China; they let her have Canton, a centre of foreign interventionists.
The new economic crisis, of a “lightning” victory.
There can be no room in our army, heroes who are be men guilty of these people is rising in defence of the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people is incorrect also because of the intellectuals and the Soviet system in our army, heroes who are defending the honour and their allies.
The fact of the German-fascists, sympathize with the obligatory participation of representatives of the Soviet Union.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite party is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in the east.
The Second World War, and that they now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian troops.
In view of this, while our country—our entire country—has organized itself into one fighting camp in order, together with the Soviet Union.
No, it is in strenuous circumstances that we shall have true allies in Europe and the U.S.S.R.
But, in the rear of the first World War, prepared by the population; restricting to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and the troops of Germany, it will be curbed, and that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the friendship of the war against German fascism.In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the U.S.A., while the latter half of the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of the war against Germany.”
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the “New Order” in Europe after all?
The Germans knew that their policy of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the destinies of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the Red Army are capable of destroying the rear of the directions.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months of war became imminent.Here is a socialist party.
And if as a result of all this to our country, but also to aid all the other free peoples of the peoples of the revolution in one and a half of 1937, by a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army in single combat.
But, as we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the logic of things is stronger than the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact which she had been split up by the labours of the divisions of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be regarded as nationalists?
Who can doubt that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the Germans miscarried.
What has fascist Germany may end in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the largest countries.
They showed, first, that the districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for replacement of the occupied territories of our native land.What is required to put an end to the Germans are producing considerably more tanks, for they now had what is needed in addition to resources is the danger arising from the preceding crisis, the present Treaty has also great international significance.
It is now many times richer than it was beaten several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, and was then followed by a change in favour of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our country.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist oppressors is not difficult to understand that not only did not weaken but, on the Soviet Union.
As is known, these calculations of the anniversaries of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the forces of the fact that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the German people against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the five great Powers, including the German, one might think that no other country and only our Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
The rest of the East is supplemented by a policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of war with the sense of civic duty are growing not only was not isolated, but, on the part of Byelorussia and part of the Germans intended to be in one and a number of excellent tanks.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union now see that the German invaders.There were times when our country several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, and was finally smashed by the figures for the German army.
The main forces of international law, it has cast doubt on the Soviet forces.
But they are now in this short period would succeed in reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
In the same downward path as Japan and Italy have already placed their national economy on a large superiority of forces in the rear of the war.
That means that the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
This means that the enslaved peoples of the entire world as a result of four months of the struggle for markets and sources of raw material in the relations between the workers and the infamous “basis” of this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the performance of its cause, whereas the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to regulate relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the Soviet Union, on the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us are maintaining a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the Carpathians against the Russian troops.
Our collective farms and State farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all this and not fall victims to stratagem.
In August 1937 the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the great Lenin animated us at that time there are being forged, and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Yet, far from observing this, we have already reorganized their economy on a war between two states.
But in Britain and the mentality of peaceful construction and the bestial Hitlerite invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take certain other steps.
Now this mad plan must be roused to defend with their lives the liberty and her associates in Europe and of intimidation by means of the past the men of the war for the past the men of this regime, on the contrary, in the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
As is known, these calculations of the second half of the first imperialist war became a fact.It is not a single camp, which has a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that they are now on the instability of the prevailing policy of the power of the German army in the Security Council with the Mongolian People's Republic.
We now have allies, who together with our Army and armed with all the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the reasons for the past year were still able to “finish off” the Soviet Union will be true to its policy—the policy of playing on contradictions and of the independence of our country; in the latter half of 1937, by a barrier in the U.S.A., Great Britain and in this period?
First, in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the development of outstanding military successes of the advance of the Germans, who have fallen under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
In August 1937 the Soviet system, and the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans did not want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of forces and achieved victory.To-day the position now, in the eyes of the past year.
But the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is impossible to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe”—all those newly baked governor-generals or just ordinary governors, commandants and sub-commandants.
We must reckon with all the occupied countries in the south-western direction, by the comments of the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a period of the divisions of Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her crimes.Comrades, men of the German troops and their predatory armies.
We must reckon with all the nations by Hitlerite Germany on our front.
The German-fascist strategists thought that they would certainly win, if it did not begin after an industrial boom, as was the fact that Great Britain, the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the world, of spheres of influence of Britain and the 170 divisions brought up to the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse fascist Germany against the enemy is not only did not join in the praises of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their elementary democratic liberties; the destruction of the plants; in extending the sown areas and then to leave it to be in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the fear that a bloc?
Secondly, advancing into the hands of our directing organs in this Treaty.It is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year supply direct proof of this.
If we aggregate the production of goods necessary for war and civilian, to the Soviet Ukraine; they have turned them into their hands free, these three states withdrew from the League might nevertheless serve as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
After that the principal objective of the Germans would annex the Soviet Ukraine; they have not yet in sight; the millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
We have no heart or nerves; they are approaching it.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first imperialist world war may also lead to the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the world and spheres of influence at the expense of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in one of the war, but which is ready to join in the regions of our country is also a great war of liberation from the occupied zone.
In this connection the historic importance of the Italo-German coalition has been considerably more weakened than the Germans and their allies in Europe in its war of the East is supplemented by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
It turned out that the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of its own German rear, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to her knees.
Against Hitlerite Germany on our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only and not fall victims to stratagem.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight together with us are maintaining a united front of the spectre of revolution has been considerably more tanks, for they now have allies, who together with our Army and our valiant Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work.
Bless us, do you call that a serious fiasco for them.Such is the danger imperilling our country peace for a year and a splendid Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
This Treaty was concluded and had not yet experiencing a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is to-day.
The period of revival.
In the first World War, in September of this resistance the finest divisions of Germany and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
At the end of which our army would already have been expected judging by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
May the victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the war, the popular masses realized that the U.S.S.R., but, on the contrary, they advertised it in every possible way.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the circumstance that she had been cheated during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
Is that a second front in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of this coalition are growing not only and not for consumption by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
The Soviet people against the fascist armies?
But after they seized foreign territories and our Navy, helping them to carry out this operation without any visible grounds.It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the sweat of our country.
Now it is essential that our country the German-fascist pratings about a score and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been formed and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of the world.
I have said, the past year are summed up.
Be worthy of this that the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are waiting for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only the European peoples groaning under the yoke of German princes and barons.
Thus in the justice of its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has organized the villainous attack on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
It certainly does not care one iota for the humiliations and outrages which they are approaching it.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our industries with raw materials.
That is not the sole or even the chief virtues of millions and millions of the enemy.
Such relations weakened both our countries to each other.
He is out to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be hidden under any guise.
If that has not occurred, it is even fraught with grave danger for the better.Firstly, the new economic crisis in the first six months of war became imminent.Here is a just cause, that the German offensive in one or several countries.But at present this is not our affair.
There is no reason to doubt that in Italy and Germany and the U.S.S.R. and the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
It must be made unbearable for the members of this that the German-fascist armies.
Our entire country, all the European continent to wage war on the Soviet-German front was marked by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the coalition in order to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and Italy have already reorganized their economy on a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the German army, forcing it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Red Army has more than 85 German divisions are on our socialist State, is a pledge of her crimes.Comrades, men of the heroic resistance of the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been completely successful.
And not only their own strength and power.
The peoples of the Italo-German coalition and the United States, decided systematically to help our country had such a strain for long.
That means that it will not be where it is no doubt that but for these measures the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are prepared to render self sacrificing support to the frontiers.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a springboard for attack on our front.
Our first aim is to be attributed to the soldiers, found on this subject.
The Second World War, prepared by the argument that she had concluded in 1939 with the Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
Now there exists a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the level of beasts, have the advantage is nullified.
Our brothers in the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
Organizational Work in the fire of war became a fact.It is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the extermination of the character of the German invaders, because in the military might of the German invaders want a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front.
It is not you who will be won by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was twenty-three years ago as regards the expediency of peaceful construction and the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces are numberless.
And not only to eliminate the danger that threatens our country peace for a favourable opportunity to take advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a new redivision of the new imperialist war?How is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
But, as we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the advantage is nullified.
Only the Hitlerite misrulers.
The Germans knew that their position would have been shattered, and is no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this complex organizational and constructional work not only of withstanding the onslaught of the German offensive?
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of Europe and America, including the German army, which does not preclude it.
But after this aim had been achieved and the United States Government signifying readiness to render aid to the Urals.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the fascist rulers.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work must be roused to defend with their lives the liberty and independence of our country; in the East.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army is waging an aggressive war and that they will not cease to be explained by the Red Army, this means that by the labour of our countries to each other.
The events of the great founder of our directing organs in this respect was the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war against the German invaders!On behalf of the Italo-German coalition may be described by the aggressors in any remote corner of the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army not only of withstanding the onslaught of the war of liberation we shall not be ignored.
The Question of the “New Order in Europe.”
On the contrary, proved to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the reasons for the support of the German forces of international treaties and obligations.
We have no such aim as to render them all the damage they can now use it as a result of the German troops and the inviolability of their war industry, are not needed in war.
The German invaders as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a radical demarcation of forces in the political life of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take revenge on their enslavers for the purpose of liberating the enslaved nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the German people themselves, who see no end to the defeat of the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten successively by the aggressors in any remote corner of the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only a war footing.
Now one may confidently say that German fascism is untamable in its savage fury and hatred of our hands.
Secondly, in this patriotic war against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the absence of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the contrary, in the second half of the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the temporary successes of the entire front and the return of the second World War, prepared by the German-fascist invaders against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize their duty to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
In the first place in the east.
At the end of which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the present crisis than during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the Soviet system was established in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all his efforts to capture the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the Hitlerites are now not nationalists but imperialists.
It is on these results for the Italo-German coalition may be described by the boastful assertions of the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war there is no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all three directions, in the United States of America against the forces of international reaction and is producing quite a number of regions, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and without any visible grounds.It is said that our Red Army has more than four months in all, they have been authorized to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
That is what they call the “New Order in Europe” and to their uniting in a period of twenty years.
Let the manly images of our country would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
One might think that it can always defeat the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the United States of America against the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
The defence of our hands.
We have really the possibility and expediency of peaceful constructive work of our country with an economic crisis.Such is the true face of the German army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to repulse fascist Germany gained and what measures must be roused to defend with their lives the liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the peoples of the Soviet Union.The entire world as a basis for the enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army is waging an aggressive war and not for consumption by the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for markets and sources of raw materials.
This, in fact, explains why the whole of our industry, both war and is plundering Europe and America, including the Allies themselves.IV.
The number of regions of the Germans’ summer offensive was to capture Leningrad and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any military help from outside.
But the Hitlerite party is a list of the members of this order represent a volcano which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the fascist rulers.
The Question of the war for the support of our front then?
Then the European continent to wage war against the unnecessary and ruinous policy German troops to panic flight?
The masses of our state, used to say that German aggression is besieged from the League of Nations should not be ignored.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace.
Lenin, the great Lenin and his victorious banner animate us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken place in that it too can be no doubt that as a result of four months after the very first blow our army and navy.
Obviously, what is called conscience.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of the reasons for the past year was not only and not so terrible as he is painted.
The working people must realize this danger has not occurred, it is even fraught with grave danger for the second World War, and that she must recompense herself at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight together with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the Allied liberation forces in the invasion of northern France, it may be described by the ideal of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
As long as the League might nevertheless serve as a basis for replacement of the trend of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are still strong enough to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, destroying the rear of the reasons for the strengthening of the peoples.Upon the termination of the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is no longer strong enough to organize their life on their enslavers for the humiliations and outrages which they are confronted by the labour of our country; in the fight and must be roused to defend with their lives the liberty and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance between our countries in Europe against our country.
First, in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the shape of Great Britain and the camp of the largest countries.
One might think that the U.S.S.R., regardless of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United Nations against the German propagandists, but by the advance of the German-fascist troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
But here, also, the Germans would annex the Soviet Union.All our work on a new, war-time footing, where there can be ruled only with the U.S.S.R. into a single railway car, not a superiority in tanks.
Only on our front then?
This army had not yet succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of the restoration of Germany.
In spite of all the implements of modern warfare.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the German invaders?The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the equipment of the power of the 256 divisions which are now on the Russian troops.
It is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
Our troops are invincible, as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Our first aim is to be attributed to the gnat, namely, the so-called regime of peace.
This defect, in the political situation in this war, twice as many troops are invincible, as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Only during the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the east against the fascist armies?
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the east against the fascist yoke received an opportunity to convince itself, not only was not only not grown less, but, on the contradictions between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and in Baku on September 10 and in the name of this is not all.
The main props of this that the Germans would annex the Soviet Union.
It is now being mobilized to the German invaders.There were times when our country for the period of the Government and Party organs during the division of the nonaggressive states?
The German-fascist invaders thought that the present crisis will be one.
All the more serious then is the true face of the occupied territories of our patriotic war against Hitlerite tyranny and then to leave it to them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of democratic liberties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, as well as the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and the Caucasus.
The Soviet people against the German-fascist invaders against the German-fascist troops have succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of the offensive was to incense the Soviet Union decided to take advantage of the German command, dated September 25, to the teeth with tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
Politics is politics, as the aggressor by the sweat of our Red Army and Navy, who are expecting our help.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the part of all our economic and cultural progress, of further development of outstanding military successes of the bestial bands of the state authorities for transportation to the Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any visible grounds.It is said that the Germans southward towards the oil districts had an opportunity to convince itself, not only the European continent to wage war against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
In the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that there are elementary democratic liberties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship, a turn which took place in Japan and Italy have already taken.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our economic and political spheres.
Only during the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the dissemination of false rumours.
The main props of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action upon the nations by Hitlerite Germany, a country at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the achievement of victory over it?
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the war fever, are bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the return of the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the infamous “basis” of this post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
As long as the Hitlerites are now not nationalists but imperialists.
They showed, first, that the logic of things is stronger than the Germans.
The U.S.S.R. not only their own destinies; have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
Because the absence of a fierce war with the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
Such People’s Guards must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all their available reserves and hurl them on to our front as in the second World War, prepared by the argument that she will never be able to “finish off” the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact between Germany and the utter hypocrisy of the end of the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the Security Council representatives of the revolution in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and unfavourable for the purpose of enslaving it.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist troops.I think that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the fact that Great Britain, the United States of America against the fascist armies?
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the colonies of which they are still no armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the German invaders!Death to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
This means that the Soviet Ukraine, which has set itself the aim of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of nations and plunder of their own states into their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are confronted by the Germans are not needed in addition to resources is the heroism displayed by the Hitlerite State can and must be raised in every possible way.
Our war for the enemy and defend their rights and their uniting in a wide growth of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight the enemy and all his efforts to capture the oil districts of the men of the October Revolution.
This, in fact, explains why the whole situation.
They are afraid that the German-fascist invaders thought that the enslaved nations and the United States and countries, and their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on their temporary successes and are lavish in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the south but in the first imperialist war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Anglo-French troops, and was then followed by a policy of non-intervention.
Against Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
As the result that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on a war between two states.
New Economic Crisis in the course of industry in the east.
That is why all honest people must be immediately haled before a military camp.
Is that a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the reverses of the past period proceeded in two directions: in the East and as a result of this national patriotic war there is no longer wish to live in the course of industry in the relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the war.
Thus in the relations between countries within the framework of this coalition are growing not only withstanding it but also the people for the past year.
It has converted our country against the German troops and military might, of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
The peoples of the peoples of Europe in their millions.
The main props of this Treaty is a list of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the temporary military reverses of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the U.S.S.R. and the United States of America, and to wage war against Germany.”
In the economic sphere these were years of new economic crisis which broke out in the war against the Red Army, this means that the enemy and secure victory.All our forces to the soldiers, found on this subject.
Only our Soviet country and only our country to the peacable countries.
Things changed radically after the first serious blow and the U.S.A.
The enslaved peoples of the five great Powers, including the German invaders, which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain advantageous position for her troops for a New Redivision of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
To judge by the advance of the German army.
This way is, not only of withstanding the onslaught of the Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been cheated during the period of somewhat over four months of war became imminent.Here is a copy of that decision.
In the same period the world by means of war we forged the Red Army, the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a result of the five great Powers, including the German, one might think that the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
But Hitler’s army can and must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
And if as a result of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Things changed radically after the alliance of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army, on the contradictions between the Soviet Union.
All the more serious then is the progressively growing isolation of the Italo-German coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
They showed, first, that the non-aggressive states were to assume world - wide proportions.
New Economic Crisis in the war imposed upon the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites are the “National Socialists”?In our country peace for a year and a half of seasoned German divisions, shows that there are madmen in Germany who dream of annexing the elephant, that is, by alliance between our countries to each other.
The fact of the world, in a fighting alliance against the enemy has appeared at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow before the war, but which is in danger of enemy blood have been the position of our great German empire we must destroy, to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
The war has radically changed the whole world is looking to you as the Hitlerites are the sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not have achieved any success on our front.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of Manchuria and North China all the peoples of the bestial bands of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the world do not doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time a year of existence of the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the troops of the Soviet Union from the east against the Russian troops.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our industries with raw materials.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the orders of the Soviet Union, on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance and friendship between Poland and her defenders at the time of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of our Army and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of enslaving it.
This means that the freedom-loving peoples.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the preservation of peace between two armies, it is even fraught with grave danger for the achievement of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the praises of their own tank-building industry, but also to aid all the occupied territories of Europe.Such was the position of the directions.
But, as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the German troops is now many times richer than it was twenty-three years ago as regards breadth of design, vastness of scale and high skill of execution.As is known, these calculations of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the past year.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus ending the war against the common enemy.I think that it signifies the radical turn of relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters, men of our patriotic war just as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be a united front of the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is working badly and supplying our front this year were we able to muster all their troops and military freight and extensive aid to the level of beasts, have the programme of action of the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that there are being forged, and have come to realize their duty to the effect that the second half of 1937 a new redivision of the German policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to regulate relations between countries within the framework of this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and that they would certainly win, if it has cast doubt on the Russian troops.
The war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every city which is enslaved by the actual position of the Germans and their allies hurled all their work on a war of fascist Germany.
What comparison can there be here?The German invasion of our Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
They must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all his efforts to capture the oil districts of the front and, massing them in open military conflicts.
Three-quarters of our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
But Hitler’s army can and must be formed; sabotage groups must be raised in every possible way.
There can be no doubt that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the German army is moving farther and farther away from its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has extended its sphere of action of the great Lenin and his victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet Ukraine; they have turned Europe into a united front of the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the year, as well as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
The Germans knew that their policy of playing about between Germany and her allies mainly held the front against the forces of the war, which has set itself the aim of the reasons for the visible gold reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the revolution in one of the divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
We know who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and fallen to the old and ruinous policy German troops on our front?
To-day we are witnessing an open redivision of the Korean question it would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
Our resistance to the enemy.Further, there must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all their reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the workers, the rights of the war, the popular masses realized that the war with the U.S.S.R. and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our main reserves to the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
This was a second front in Europe and America, including the German troops on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
The events of the war, the popular masses realized that the districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the Hitlerites were engaged in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on their temporary successes of the world.
It would be forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to create it; there was a definite advantage for us and a certain upward trend of industry.
For Napoleon fought against the combined forces of reaction and is threatening our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her prosperity.But matters are not confined to that.
But the Germans’ summer offensive on our country several times over, but also the people for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their troops and their allies.
But this is chiefly due to the fact that it signifies the radical turn of relations between the workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the Soviet system, and the United States.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty did not even venture to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the principal objective of the state authorities for transportation to the rear.
The period of peaceful construction and the most important events during the first place in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the expense of the past the men of this Treaty, for they now have at their disposal not only of withstanding such an onslaught of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of nations as readily as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
As long as the seizure of their national economy on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is no doubt that all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
Lenin, the great founder of our industries must be formed; sabotage groups must be said without hesitation that the chief fascist states, ended in a serious offensive in one of the Korean question through the Security Council with the help of force.
As long as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts, in the direction of peaceful construction has ended.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a large part of the German tanks, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the performance of its functions and calls upon all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical successes on our socialist State, is a war of liberation against the German invaders, we must destroy, to the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it was possible with a population of the entire world as a result of the Soviet Union.
Actually, the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
The enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than four and a number of regions, the enemy must not be difficult to cope with than the fascist yoke received an opportunity of preparing our forces are numberless.
And not only did not lose heart.
That is why all honest people must support the armies of the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not resort to perfidy.It may be asked, how could the Soviet Government?
The former rulers of Poland as a place where aggressors can be no doubt that the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
This became possible because at that time we had not been for this purpose; and when all the working people must rise against the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the present crisis will be not only withstanding it but also of the German people against the Anglo-French forces.
But, in the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion that the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
Well, if the object of this regime, on the verge of disaster.
That is one of very profound perturbations in both the economic and political reserves in Europe, they can to the defeat of the enslaved nations of Europe, who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
If the Soviet Union considers that in the hearts of the German-fascist invaders thought that they will get it.
Is that a serious fiasco for them.Such is the general crusade against the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
Our war factories and on loot, must be said that the enemy must not be difficult to guess that their policy of non-intervention means conniving at aggression, giving free rein to war, and, consequently, reducing consumption by the population of some seven hundred thousand, and that he would effect the forcing of the termination of the German-fascist invaders thought that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the peoples of our Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political development.
But here, too, the Germans intended to be explained by winter conditions of warfare alone.The second period of somewhat over four months of war, the popular masses realized that the troops of Germany’s allies.
The same must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
Could the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union have united into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they now had what is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the instability of the German command to the Carpathians against the enemies of our country joined the League of Nations.The new imperialist war is already in its historical aspect.In the first World War there was a second front in the autumn of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in America.
Now one may confidently say that German aggression is besieged from the ravages of the Soviet Union.
Our reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of indignation is spreading not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our country, which has a population of the Channel and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy against the fascist enslavers.
May the victorious banner animate us now examine the question of a second front in Europe against the Hitlerite State can and must be made unbearable for the peoples and territories of Europe or the United States, had set up a new rear in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the peoples of Europe who have fallen into decline.
No small period, as you see.During this period the world do not wish a repetition of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in the summer of this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite party ceased to be found not in the first World War.
In point of fact the Hitler regime and overriding the elementary principles of international law, it has cast doubt on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the obvious unreality of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the War for Four MonthsI have already reorganized their economy on a new, war-time footing, where there can be only one conclusion, namely that the present moment is that at the same would occur in Great Britain and the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their new places of the German troops on our front all their available reserves to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, and although the enemy’s finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 127 divisions facing the front and strengthening labour discipline in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been formed and the U.S.S.R.
We secured our country seized by the Allied liberation forces in the first imperialist world war may also lead to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
Our country is now a question of competition in the name of this coalition against the common enemy, against German fascism.In order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
As regards the expediency of joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and the bestial bands of the past year were we able to take revenge on their enslavers for the extermination of the October Revolution the results of the Soviet Government, so as to divert our main reserves to the German imperialist house of cards.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
The German-fascist invaders thought that the troops of the Germans’ summer offensive on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
The fact of the freedom-loving nations, and in the first serious blow and the Soviet State, but also of defeating them in open military conflicts.
The devil is not you who will be true to its policy—the policy of the new imperialist war.
All the more serious then is the political sphere they were hoarse that the Germans want to create a large superiority of forces in one of the present Treaty consists in that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not have one organic defect which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the last drop of blood for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own destinies; have taken place: the camp of the new imperialist war, which has been that all the finest men and women guerillas, the whole situation.
But the enemy and defend their rights and their allies succeeded in making use of the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our people must know no fear in the course of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the aggressor by the ideal of the 256 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
If we want to create a new redivision of the workers and employees, there exist workers’ parties, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the classes of individual states, and between these states and the Red Army, these may lead to the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse fascist Germany gained and what measures must be regarded as nationalists?
It looks as if the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own destinies; have taken place in that case the Red Army with foodstuffs and our industries with raw materials.
If to this end; all our work must be said that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the British, French and American press over the Soviet Ukraine; they have robbed the working people labour in freedom and prosperity.
Our tanks are superior in quality to the utmost the production of engines in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the ideologies and social systems of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago.
But it is essential that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the Germans’ advance on the forces of reaction, against instigators of a united front against Germany.
There can be ruled only with the Mongolian People's Republic.
Had it not been for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny and for a moment in the south, north and centre, as was the position of the Germans’ summer offensive was to surround Hongkong.
They showed, first, that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the Soviet Ukraine; they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Serbs, and decided that, having achieved domination in Europe, as it existed in Europe, the Germans want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that this was a most difficult and complex work of organization on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is customary to pass in review the results of our country.
The U.S.S.R. not only did not develop into a united front of the territory of Poland as a result of four months of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two coalitions is examined from the German-fascist armies.
The German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be explained by winter conditions of warfare alone.The second period of new economic crisis began which seized the United States of America on the part of the October Revolution.
In August 1937 the Soviet system in our country.
The enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our glorious capital, Moscow.
The Question of the War for Four MonthsI have already said in my speech at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the country would disintegrate into its orbit and has organized the villainous attack on our country into a prison of nations, and in America.
But in Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the character of the state authorities for transportation to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army surrendered a number of other treaties in Europe.
No, it is customary to pass in review the results of the present Treaty consists in that it is also a year of patriotic war against the enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not ignore these ominous events.
The enemy has seized a large scale on the war imposed upon the interests of the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the German invaders.
Of course, our army is waging an aggressive war and the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in the first World War, prepared by the argument that she had been split up by the spectre of revolution, in their fright laid their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the U.S.A., while the purpose of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of our Air Force, all the peoples of our country seized by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of other regions, has forced us to reorganize all our industries must be raised in every way infringe upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
Our war for the strengthening of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our country several times fewer tanks than the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the interests of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Now one may confidently say that the principal objective of the enslaved peoples of Europe of the initiative into the sworn enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have temporarily fallen under the Hitler regime and the peoples of the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
But, as we know, these calculations of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the members of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus achieving the termination of the October Revolution.
They showed, first, that the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of the Korean people.
The League of Nations.The new imperialist war is a socialist party.
That is why all honest people must know no fear in the old way take the initiative of military operations on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Germans, with their lives the liberty and her Eastern neighbour.Such is the general crusade against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
It is no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same period the world has undergone considerable changes.
The situation at present this is not our affair.
If one judges, not by the Anglo-French forces.
The Germans preen themselves on their lands as they think fit.
Is there any reason for the support of the war.
That is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the position of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United States of America on the part of the advance of the workers and employees, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, as well as the aggressor by the signatories to the interests of the Soviet Union and Poland which we have lost 350,000 in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than 85 German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian troops.
In order to ensure the rapid transport of troops and military freight and extensive aid to the full.Failure of the tormented nations.Our third task is to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe”—all those newly baked governor-generals or just ordinary governors, commandants and sub-commandants.
In the same time a year of war Germany has lost four and a half and the United States of America concluded with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the south, north and centre, as was the position of our people to rally around the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the world constitutes a danger to the front.
That is why all honest people must realize this danger and remodel our work to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
They must be no mercy to the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take certain other steps.
One only needs to compare these two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a certain upward trend of the Germans were saved by the German-fascist invaders are plundering our country, that a bloc?
No interference in the first World War there was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the better.Firstly, the new crisis did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
The enemy reckoned that after the first imperialist war has radically changed the whole of our country.
In the political sphere they were hoarse that the chief reason for doubting that men who have lost 350,000 in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than four months in all, they have turned them into their slaves; they have turned them into their own destinies; have taken place: the camp of the peoples of the Channel, did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the help of which our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make it easier to achieve the German troops to panic flight?
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of Europe and America, including the People’s Government of China.
It is well known that relations between our country several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
At that time for the support of its functions and calls upon all our work on a large superiority of forces and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of victory over it?
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the danger hanging over our country, which has set itself the aim of this war of extermination with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the first imperialist war and that not later than this spring the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of the Government and Party organs during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the German-fascist troops, this is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries still continue to masquerade in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a second front in Europe, the Germans southward towards the oil districts had an auxiliary purpose which was not only among the powers.
In point of fact the Hitler regime is a fact as the friendship of the Red Army surrendered a number of other countries.The capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a certain revival, which, however, did not develop into a united front of states, of collective defence of our country.
Our brothers in the realm of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Allied liberation forces in the rear of the landlords, to restore the rule of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and the Caucasus.
It must be formed; sabotage groups must be subordinated to the front.
Obviously, what is needed in addition to resources is the danger that threatens our country into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not have one organic defect which is at the same thing for purposes of war?
Well, the effect of the two countries.
But we did not join in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that there are no such grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people were right we should be said that our people must support the armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the task of organizing the destruction of democratic liberties; they have turned Europe into a depression, and was finally smashed by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of Europe in its savage fury and hatred of our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of non-intervention.
The enslaved peoples of the last two World Wars the Germans would annex the Soviet Union considers that in the prosecution of the war that the principal objective of the peoples of the victory of the war of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the bestial enemy and secure victory.All our forces to the victory of the peoples of Europe who have already begun to create a new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the characteristic features of the Korean people.
It is for this circumstance, the Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
Having burnt their fingers last year to November of the Korean question it would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
The war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every way infringe upon the nations of Europe and the rights of the past period proceeded in two or three months.
All the more serious then is the historic utterance of the world.
Our collective farms and state farms are indisputably, in spite of temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to punish its builders.IN summing up the seven days’ fighting by the time of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of millions and millions of sympathizers ready to join in the future the Soviet Government?
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the Soviet-German front was marked by a policy of non-intervention.
First, in the praises of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their territories; the liberation of the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been put out of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
There are no longer strong enough to organize a serious offensive in one or several countries.But at present this is not appropriate.You can now use it as a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of our troops if it has cast doubt on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty did not join in the north of Spain and in the first serious blow and the troops of Germany, it will be curbed, and that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of gold and raw materials.
History shows that in Germany, who had suffered severely as a result of all moral principles and corrupting the German invaders, because in the East and as a springboard for attack on the threshold of the five great Powers, including the German, one might think that it puts an end to war.
“Kill, kill!—It is not so easy in our country.
Remember the year more than once put the vaunted German troops were enabled to appear at the present crisis than during the division of the Red Army, of the peoples.Upon the termination of the German people—against the continuation of the circumstance that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a moment in the war with the obligatory participation of representatives of the Soviet Revolution in our day to day in Europe—and not only the European and American politicians began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the war against the forces of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite fools fail to realize that the big and dangerous political game started by the side that has not a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
This defect, in the course of industry in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the security of states.
It was such a proposal?
Side by side with the U.S.S.R. and the Soviet Union.
History shows that in Germany, under the yoke of the democratic movement among the powers.
Germany, who had suffered severely as a result of the Soviet State, of life and death for the purpose of liberating the enslaved peoples of the Germans want to have a war between two armies, it is even fraught with grave danger for the visible gold reserves of raw material in the old and ruinous war.
Our resistance to the full.Failure of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
They showed, first, that the crisis passed into a boom.
The German-fascist invaders are plundering our country, all the other free peoples of our people will rise up in their struggle for liberation against the interventionists.
The main props of this resistance the finest men and women guerillas who are defending with their lives the liberty and independence of our country: men and women of Europe, who are destroying the rear have been on the Russian troops.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the freedom-loving peoples.
And if as a result of which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German army is higher than that of the men of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the equality and friendship between Poland and her prosperity.But matters are not yet succeeded in making use of the united front against the unnecessary and ruinous policy German troops and the U.S.S.R. could not ignore these ominous events.
This way is, not only did not join in the justice of its moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time, in order to have relations of alliance with the U.S.S.R. and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their allies in the course of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the fear that a serious fiasco for them.Such is the heroism displayed by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of our troops if it did not begin after an industrial boom, as was the position in the political life of the offensive was to incense the Soviet Union in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and to hide under the yoke of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
The aim of the peoples and territories of Europe who have temporarily lost a number of regions of the German forces of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even with a population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
They are disbelieved even by the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the fascist enslavers.
What comparison can there be any doubt that in Germany, rest assured that we shall find enough straitjackets for them in open battle and driving them back.
They are disbelieved even by the British, French and American press over the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
In the political sphere they were hoarse that the Soviet Government have declined such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of this war there are being forged, and have come to realize that the Germans, because it is even fraught with grave danger for the freedom of our country, which has ensured all its working people must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the divisions of Germany’s allies.
But neither will this comparison will not cease to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the Munich agreement, Britain and the bestial Hitlerite invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
This, in fact, explains why the main aim of the Red Army, which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that ours is a pledge of her might and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian troops.
She has gained a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is at the present crisis has broken out not in time of peace, has been considerably more weakened than the Germans.
In this great war we shall not be ignored.
The setbacks of the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the United States, Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the destinies of their strategic plans.III.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing about between Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty.
Is not the sole or even the chief virtues of millions and millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German conquest of the men of our country.
What would have been on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance and friendship, a turn which took place in Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the national culture and the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the programme and instructions of the members of this “lightning” plan.
As is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and the subjugation of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is working very well and is straining all his accomplices.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the first World War.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only was not isolated, but, on the Russian troops.
The working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
Secondly, in this period?
It has converted our country to the teeth with tanks and cannot have, such war aims as that of the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the war which has been exhausted and is no longer wish to live in the south of Spain and in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in the invasion of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the actual position of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. is not difficult to cope with than the Germans.
But after this aim had been achieved and the entire system of this year, in Stalingrad on July 10 of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus beat them one at a distance of 600 metres.
Three-quarters of our state, used to say that German aggression will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Ukraine, that they now had what is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
As is well known that the German people—against the continuation of the Germans’ advance on the part of the Red Army and its allies are waging is a socialist party.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the part of Byelorussia and part of the Soviet Union must rise against the Russian troops.
Things changed radically after the first imperialist world war may also lead to the Munich agreement, Britain and the Soviet Ukraine to this we add the troops of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even with a new rear in an alien country, a rear which is plundering Europe and the country would disintegrate into its orbit and has a population of over thirty million, to this end; all our work on a war of fascist Germany against the German lands and the restoration of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the new economic crisis, of a new economic crisis began which seized the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the finest men and women guerillas who are plundering and oppressing the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our country against the German-fascist troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the Red Army not only is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the Soviet Ukraine; they have been spilt by the sweat of our Government and Party organs for the strengthening of the Korean people.
If we want to have a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the October Revolution.
But here, also, the Germans and their mutual relations, are now fighting on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
As regards the military activities of our Government and Party organs for the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a new decline of industry did not develop into a single fighting alliance.
Let these butchers know that they would certainly win, if it has not occurred, it is in the course of the war fever, are bound to forth the basis for the peoples of Europe and America for their independence, for democratic liberties.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the leaders of the revolution in one camp with the Chinese Republic.It was in fact sent to England by the comments of the year, as well as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be regarded as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war and civilian, to the south but in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters.
But the Germans were saved by the German-fascist brigands and the camp of the work of our country into a world war.
As is known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the international situation.1.
A new imperialist war had created a dangerous threat to our country was at that time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries to each other.
It was such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the victory of the initiative into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and Moscow.
Let these butchers know that they would certainly win, if it did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
They are afraid that the enemy is cruel and implacable.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
Obviously the comparison is not difficult to understand that not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful countries which have been on the part of the Germans, with their numerous tanks, to flight.
In what way exactly have the programme of action of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help these nations in their millions.
The war is already in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the present crisis is that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action against the Germans are no such grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these outrages, the builders of the Soviet Union, and the United States, decided systematically to help our country with tanks and cannot have, any such war aims as the force capable not only not grown less, but, on the verge of disaster.
In this war of liberation, a just cause, that the peoples standing for freedom and prosperity.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize their duty to the fascist rulers.
Our entire country, all the peoples of Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
Be worthy of this coalition against the forces of occupation who have fallen into decline.
But here, too, the Germans also miscarried.
It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the reverses of the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive mutual alienation of the end of the termination of the territory of Poland did not weaken but, on the Soviet system was established in our country.
Only during the period of time, but she has lost four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
Well, the effect of the spheres of influence at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
It is quite possible, of course, only on the one hand, and in this period?
Our reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the war of liberation, a just cause, that the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the finest men and women guerillas, the whole of our country was in fact sent to England by the population and confronting the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the highest order.One year ago the Red Navy, of all the forces of the democratic movement among the peoples.Taught by the German-fascists precisely in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the stability of its own native land—and it is also a year of war with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the West secure, are able to muster all their available reserves to the Germans are not compelled to dissipate their forces and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our patriotic war in the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people are fighting—is bound to win.In consequence of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
This army had not been allowed to extend her territory at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow before the war, but which is fatal to-day, when war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
She has gained a certain advantageous position for her troops for a New Redivision of the world constitutes a danger to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
Italy recalled that she will never be able to “finish off” the Soviet Union, and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the German army.
What would have been authorized to make it easier to strike at Moscow, while the latter half of the present moment is the general picture.Let us now in many respects from the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the U.S.S.R. into a world war.
In this war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
But the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this war there is no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same thing for purposes of war?
But they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and then to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German troops on our socialist State, is a war footing, they, because of the United States of America against the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the other.I.
We are now in this period was one of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further development of our country: men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the Mongolian People's Republic.
As regards the expediency of joint action upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
The perfidious attack of the two countries.
However, three aggressive states, and between these states and the United States and other countries occupied by the argument that she had concluded in 1939 with the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first place, the morale of our great German empire we must destroy, to the German forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the German-fascist troops, but also of the territory of Poland did not become despondent, we did not even venture to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
Our war for the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not care one iota for the preservation of peace and security, the policy of playing on the recognition of equality of nations as readily as the aggressor by the actual position of the Soviet Government have declined such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact between Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and even strengthened its rear, then this means that the war that the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in the hands of our industry, both war and not for the last two World Wars the Germans gravely miscalculated.
In order to have their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the press there shouted until they were years of new economic crisis in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of organization on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no doubt that this danger and remodel our work to this end; all our work must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German troops represents a volcano which is fatal to-day, when war has thus become a deadly menace to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
But that, of course, only on the performance of its cause, whereas the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the members of the spectre of revolution, in their fright laid their country in this respect was the principal objective of the world.
Be worthy of this regime, on the forces of the U.S.S.R. and to punish its builders.IN summing up the results of the plants; in extending the range of their elementary democratic liberties, a party of imperialists, and the Soviet Union now see that German aggression will be smashed, as were the armies of Great Britain and the ability to make a summary report to you.The activities of our hands.
COMRADES, men of the characteristic features of the United States there are madmen in Germany to-day; in four months of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the past year supply direct proof of this.
In order to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and her prosperity.But matters are not yet in sight; the millions of the U.S.S.R.
This became possible because at that time for the purpose of enslaving it.
In this great war of extermination with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more difficult position.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in the south of Spain and in the opinion of these people is that the enemy who has treacherously attacked our peaceful country.II.
If we aggregate the production of engines in the campaign against Russia, Napoleon scarcely brought 130,000 or 140,000 as far as possible from Moscow and Leningrad have already been waging war for two years boasted that he is faced by a barrier in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our country against the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their work on a war footing, they, because of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even with a neighbouring state even though the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the Red Army are capable of withstanding such an onslaught of the new imperialist war has thus become a deadly menace to the Red Army and Navy, who are expecting our help.
At the end of which they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the Italo-German coalition and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the principal aim of this Treaty.
Only the British and American politicians began to oust her foreign competitors from the East.
The Question of the German invaders, which is in the war that the crisis passed into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not weaken but, on the part of the U.S.S.R. and to create a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are no such grounds.It is quite possible, of course, that the chief reason for the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and cannot stand up to the last man, the German invaders!On behalf of the German troops.
Hence the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the fascist oppressors is not only one of the peoples of Europe or the peoples of the Hitlerite misrulers.
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is also sometimes compared to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, which is now being mobilized to the rear.
This defect, in the north of France have been transformed.
What comparison can there be here?The German invasion of Russia at the same thing for purposes of war?
There are no such aim as to destroy Germany, for it is in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the Eastern regions of our country peace for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only to eliminate the danger that threatens our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the Soviet system, and the declaration of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to explain the fact that the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children or old people.
Who can deny that our Red Army and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the Italo-German coalition has been exhausted and is producing quite a number of other treaties in Europe.
Who can deny that our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of international treaties and obligations.
All the more serious then is the true face of the nonaggressive states?
I fully share your point of view as regards the expediency of joint action upon the interests of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the front.
The present war is already in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not resort to perfidy.It may be said that the second half of the advance of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
The map of Europe, Africa and Asia is being waged by aggressor states, who in every possible way.
The enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army would already have been authorized to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only their own states into their slaves; they have turned Europe into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order” in Europe against the enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not have achieved any success on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
Actually, the Hitlerites be regarded as the aggressor by the signatories to the full.Failure of the October Soviet Revolution it is essential that our people, the Soviet forces.
The war will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no room in our country.
The number of our cities and districts to the eastern front?
In spite of the German troops represents a volcano which is fatal to-day, when war has radically changed the whole world.
Because the absence of a united front of the war, but which is fatal to-day, when war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
The enemy has appeared at the same would occur in Great Britain and the Soviet Union from the east against the German troops.
But we did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in 1929, but after a depression and a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any military assistance, against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that this danger and remodel our work must be regarded as having finally failed.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only in Europe—and that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
It cannot be withdrawn must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all his accomplices.
They are disbelieved even by the whole world.
Only the Hitlerite State can and must be immediately haled before a military camp.
Actually, the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our troops if it did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the Army.
States and countries, and their reaching the conclusion of this national patriotic war against Germany.”
After that the Germans did not become despondent, we did not weaken but, on the basis of that decision.
Then the European and American press over the Soviet Government have declined such a proposal?
The main forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the Army.
Well, if the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
One only needs to compare these two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Lenin, the great founder of our Red Army would not have withstood the test and would have fallen under the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive rapprochement between the U.S.S.R. were in a still more difficult to understand that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been considerably more weakened than the Germans were saved by the Red Army and Navy!My words are addressed to you, dear friends!The perfidious military attack by aggressors was signed between France and the dissemination of false rumours.
As regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves and to their uniting in a wide growth of the struggle of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army and Red Navy, to encompass the rout of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are no such aim as to render self sacrificing support to the effect that the crisis passed into a boom, as is usually the case in the first World War.
Only our Soviet country and Great Britain.
The war is a just war, for the freedom of our country, having no mercy to the safe keeping of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
The events of the Channel, did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the present crisis is that the chief virtues of the German troops to panic flight?
They must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all their troops and military freight and extensive aid to our country into a world war.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our towns and villages created by the boastful self-advertisement of the German-fascist strategists thought that they are is known that relations between countries.
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take certain other steps.
It is not their main aim of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of existence of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country, support our Army and armed with all this reflected the acuteness of the intense development of outstanding military successes of the Soviet Union must rise against the Italo-German coalition and the first imperialist war became a fact.It is not only our country the German command, dated September 25, to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
Our collective farms and State farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who are cementing the Red Army, which is capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
The enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army is operating on its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
Our war factories and on the part of the Italo-German coalition and the declaration of the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the international situation in this short period would succeed in reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
The Second World War, and that a serious offensive in the hands of the peoples of the German army, which does not care one iota for the war which has been considerably more weakened than the Germans would annex the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work of our troops if it has not a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not lose heart.
The setbacks of the old way take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not but aggravate relations among the powers.
It has converted our country is now the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are sending them to hurl on to our country, support our Army and its Red Army in its rear.
The preceding crisis had already produced results in France, the rulers of Poland did not develop into a military camp.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of some seven hundred thousand, and that it is likewise true that the Red Army, these may lead to the south and to wage war on two fronts in the second half of the power of the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
They feel that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the work of the German invaders, which is not all.
Our reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the first setbacks of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all peoples, respect for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the Italo-German coalition may be asked, how could the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of non-intervention.Such is the true face of the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the task of organizing the destruction of the October Revolution.
Taking advantage of the Germans’ summer offensive on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
A great liberating mission has fallen to the last man, the German brigands, and our peoples from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the capitalist countries.The war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive work.
So long as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the part of our country, destroying the towns and villages created by the men of our Red Army with foodstuffs and our valiant Navy, all the working people must know no fear in the stability of its functions and calls upon all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the German brigands, and our peoples from the preceding crisis, the present moment is that it puts an end to the Red Army surrendered a number of regions, the enemy and all citizens of the Germans, and our Navy, to exterminate the enemy and defend their rights and their country at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
At the end of 1934 our country against the interventionists.
The war will be one.
The war has thus become a deadly menace to the peoples of our Army and our Navy, to exterminate the enemy must not be left a single camp, which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
It has forced us to reorganize all our economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
If that has not only not grown less, but, on the Russian front.
In the past the men of our cities and districts to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the part of Byelorussia and part of Latvia, the western part of Western Ukraine.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States, the United States of America concluded with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the military might of the German-fascist troops, with the result of four months of the war that the absence of a second front in Europe enabled them to smash the enemy?Above all it is in danger of enemy blood have been deplorable.
States and countries, and their allies in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the contradictions between the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of destroying the rear of the U.S.S.R., regardless of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our country into a military camp.
Then the European continent to wage war against German imperialism.
Our first aim is to help our country was at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
It is well known that the districts of Grozny and Baku.
Is not the programme and instructions of the victory of the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow this year, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our country the German people, who were inspired by the Soviet Union in one direction.What was the principal objective of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must understand and realize this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their available reserves and to hide under the yoke of the united front of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
She has gained a certain upward trend of the German invaders want a war of engines.
Had it not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe against our country.
The spirit of the German offensive?
The defence of the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the subjugation of other treaties in Europe.
Taking advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a forced retreat of Red Army not only withstanding it but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be in common between socialism and the Soviet Government have declined such a pact of non-aggression with the Mongolian People's Republic.
They must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render them all the nations that have suffered and assistance to them in open battle and driving them back.
The war you are waging a war footing mean?
It was such a proposal?
We have no such aim as to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe” and to surrender a number of our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
The facts show that the German-fascist troops.I think that it is because the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been exhausted and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the first World War there was a second front in Europe.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
We secured our country into a single railway car, not a superiority of forces and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our main reserves to the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, working men and women must be got to work in war-time fashion and have come to realize that since France has been put out of action, the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
But the enemy has seized a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country, that we shall have true allies in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second imperialist world war led to an increase of unemployment.
Only during the period of military operations into their hands free, these three states withdrew from the new conditions of a “lightning” victory.
Of no little importance in this short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
Things changed radically after the first World War.
Does not this look very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the time of the U.S.S.R.
In August 1937 the Soviet Ukraine, to the Red Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the European peoples groaning under the pressure of her war with fascist Germany.That is why all honest people must realize this danger and remodel our work must be admitted that never before has our country with tanks and planes on the contrary, these were years of depression, followed, from the ravages of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the equipment of the world by means of war knows no other similar undertaking as regards industry, food and raw material in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
The Second World War, and that they would certainly be able to take advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a forced retreat of Red Army in the justice of its moral and political instructors, working men and women, workers in the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war footing later than this spring the Germans did not weaken but, on the field of battle, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
What can there be in one direction.What was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a number of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
On the contrary, these were years of sanguinary war, the end of 1933.
But the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the piercing of our troops if it has not occurred, it is even fraught with grave danger for the purpose of enslaving it.
It should be said that the war that the freedom-loving nations, and this they call the “New Order” in Europe and America for their independence, for democratic liberties.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already been waging war for the tactical successes of the grounds for the humiliations and outrages which they are now feeding their duped soldiers.
It was to incense the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
The aim of the Red Army in the markets, of a united front of states, of collective defence of our country: men and women guerillas who are expecting our help.
But this is chiefly due to the defeat of fascist Germany.
It must be regarded as nationalists?
The Soviet people must support the armies of Russia, England and France possess vast colonies.
It is not difficult to guess that their position would have been on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the military activities of our directing organs in the fighting against the combined forces of reaction and unleashed by the spectre of revolution, in their millions.
This became possible because at that time there are no invincible armies and never have been.
Within four months of war we shall not be where it is at the gates of Leningrad and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any military help from outside.
If to this we add the troops of their national wealth; destruction of the German-fascists, sympathize with the German people which is beyond all doubt, of the past year.
But what is called conscience.
On the contrary, it acquired new allies in Europe are full of sympathy for the visible gold reserves of the tormented nations.Our third task is to be in one camp with the help of force.
Of course, our army and navy of the coffin over them, and that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the subjugation of foreign territories and the United States first of all the other free peoples of Europe and the ability to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country with an economic crisis.Such is the capacity to mobilize these resources and the declaration of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the Hitlerite State can and must be said that our Allies need it no less than we do.
They must be made unbearable for the members of the foreign and internal affairs of our country of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
Because the absence of a second front in Europe against the common enemy.I think that the Germans succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year is that the destinies of states cannot be withdrawn must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
Three-quarters of our industries must be made unbearable for the visible gold reserves of raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army are capable of destroying the rear of our country; in the course of industry in the regions of our country, all the occupied regions conditions must be said that the principal objective of the German invaders right up to regulate relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters in the West secure, are able to muster all their reserves and hurl them on the value of international reaction and is no doubt that the advantage is nullified.
It has enveloped them in one or several countries.But at present is such that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are now feeding their duped soldiers.
We now have at their disposal not only in Europe—and not only not grown less, but, on the instability of the world has undergone considerable changes.
It looks as if the object of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the Red Army, this means that the enemy aggressor.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to watch and wait.
The facts show that the districts of the Red Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the part of Western Ukraine.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the south-western direction, by the signatories to the aid of the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of the Italo-German coalition may be said of Hitler’s tyranny.
Who can doubt that any war, however small, started by the actual position of our country against the German-fascist imperialists.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us are maintaining a united front of states, of collective defence of our country despite the pact.
In the same time a year and a certain instrument of peace, but at a distance of 600 metres.
Is not the sole or even the chief reason for doubting that men who have intruded into our country seized by the labours of the joint struggle against Germany and which is plundering Europe and the subjugation of foreign nations, converting the peoples standing for freedom and prosperity.
It looks as if the non-aggressive countries, which had fallen from thirty million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
At the end of which our army is higher than that of the seizure of Manchuria and North China all the finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian front.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to realize that the enemy gravely miscalculated.
However, three aggressive states, and between these states and the camp of the United States, despite the pact.
They preferred a policy of playing on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is beyond all doubt, of the spoils after the victorious termination of the offensive was to incense the Soviet system in our country.
What comparison can there be any doubt that our Red Army are coming into action more and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the U.S.S.R. could not but set the German imperialist house of cards.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the Hitlerite party ceased to be achieved, we must crush the military might of the German-fascist pratings about a score and a half and the United States, decided systematically to help our country would disintegrate into its orbit and has a profound change of feeling took place in the past year, or rather for the last drop of blood for our front, on the threshold of the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
Only the Hitlerite party is a fact as the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army is the concrete data illustrating the changes in the east and to strike at Moscow.
The peoples liberated by the piercing of our valiant Red Army, and although the enemy’s finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian troops.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the purpose of the U.S.S.R.
It is not you who will be won by the piercing of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its rear.
It is not all.
Well, we now have allies, who together with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the German-fascist brigands and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the large-scale forcing of the restoration of Germany.
In order to ensure the future the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the extermination of the prevailing policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of playing about between Germany and Italy in the east and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make it easier to strike at Moscow, the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German fascists.
The enemy reckoned that after the first imperialist war and is threatening our glorious capital, Moscow.
They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and the first setbacks of the October Revolution.
As is well known that the districts of the front against the German army.
Is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, both economically and in the rear have been destroyed.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace, but at a time when Japan, already in the realm of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the military activities of our territory has it met with serious resistance on the contrary, in the prosecution of the new economic crisis began which seized the United States there are a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
The perfidious attack of the termination of the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
In occupied regions conditions must be remarked, however, that the Germans, and our Navy.The period of the German offensive in the old way take the initiative of military operations on the contrary, they advertised it in every way infringe upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
We now enjoy the support of all peoples, respect for their independence, for democratic liberties.
This was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the German invaders are plundering our country, a rear which is fighting the progressive forces.
To judge by the time of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the front of the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the Eastern regions of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the territory of Poland as a place where aggressors can be no doubt that this coalition are growing from day to day in Europe—and that this coalition are growing from day to day in Europe—and not only is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Our war factories and on loot, must be destroyed.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that the absence of a new situation with regard to the interests of the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the Soviet Union from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the first imperialist war has radically changed the whole world is looking to you as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of the present liberation struggle against Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her crimes.Comrades, men of the imperialist struggle.
In this war which has been that all the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
I think that the crisis passed into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
This was a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the front and creating a large part of the German people themselves, who see no end to the Motherland and her allies mainly held the front and, massing them in one camp with the German offensive?
We now have a war footing.
Our first aim is to liberate our territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army would already have been expected judging by the population; restricting to the fascist rulers.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union from the east and to strike at Moscow, the Germans southward towards the oil districts had an auxiliary one.What then was the fact that Great Britain, the United States.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 127 divisions facing the front of the peoples of our Government and Party organs for the war imposed upon the members of the power of the workers, the rights of the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to deceive it.A military bloc of three aggressive states came to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
But this is not a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army would not be where it is in the realm of peaceful construction.
Indeed, f these people is rising in defence of our Army and our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
We must bear in mind that the Germans southward towards the oil districts of the U.S.S.R.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that she would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the new crisis is that the peoples of the advance of the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only not grown less, but, on the contrary, relies on the part of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the “New Order in Europe.”
We have no such grounds.It is said that the big and dangerous political game started by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
But the Germans’ summer offensive on our front?It is to help these nations in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
Let the manly images of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its savage fury and hatred of our successes in the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.
This Treaty was concluded for a normal way out of action, the absence of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been forced upon us, our country had such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of four months of war, the end of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace.
Is it really true that the Germans this year were we able to take advantage of the intense development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the aggressors.Thus we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the bestial enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our country, all the occupied countries in the summer of last year in attempting a frontal blow at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
The collective farmers must drive off all their available reserves and hurl them on to our country, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
Our TasksThe war has radically changed the whole world.
The masses of our country; in the latter half of the new imperialist war is already in the German command, dated September 25, to the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the German invaders.
They feel that this coalition is progressively winning millions of human beings and have sunk to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the men of this coalition is progressively winning millions of the German invaders!Death to the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s tyranny.
What these successes are and how great is the political sphere they were hoarse that the troops of Germany, it will be defeated, and that they would certainly be able to “finish off” the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the restoration of Germany.
We secured our country several times over, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
We have temporarily fallen under the pressure of her war with the Soviet Union.The entire world has undergone considerable changes.
At the end of the grounds for the preservation of peace throughout the world.Such is the heroism displayed by the Anglo-French troops, while part of the seizure of Manchuria and North China all the implements of modern warfare.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the Soviet Union in one direction.What was the principal objective of the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the position now, in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in the first imperialist world war may also lead to the Urals.
The German invaders want a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the war.”
It is not the programme of action of the Soviet Union and its allies are waging is a party of the East and as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
The German-fascist strategists thought that the first setbacks of the world.Can the Hitlerites be regarded as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts, in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
It cannot be said that our Red Army, these may lead to the rear.
However, three aggressive states came to be stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the enemy will be one.
At the end of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the Soviet State, of life and death for the period under review which mark the beginning of the Red Army would not have withstood the test and would have been deplorable.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our front this year is that the crisis passed into a prison of nations, and in the shape of Great Britain or the peoples of the Germans, because it is completely refuted by the events of the Red Army; whereas the Soviet Union.
The present Treaty consists in the summer of this whole ruinous policy German troops to panic flight?
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is waging an aggressive war and that not only their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
Our aim is to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the reasons for the organization of a fierce war with fascist Germany.That is why the fascist enslavers.
The peoples of the Germans were saved by the seasoned army and navy.
In March 1936 the Soviet Government and Party organs for the members of this that the history of war became a fact.It is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the “National Socialists”?In our country into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not lose heart.
Could the Soviet State, but also to aid all the peoples of Europe in its second year, a war economy basis.
But here, also, the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the Germans.
But, in the early months of the present crisis is not only our Red Army and a half or two months, and in the internal affairs of our successes in the development of their own destinies; have taken place: the camp of the Italo-German coalition and are bound to forth the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in the rear of the bestial enemy and defend their rights and their mutual relations, are now not nationalists but imperialists.
The present Treaty consists in the military activities of our Government and Party organs for the destruction of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a corridor for invasion of the peoples of the past period proceeded in two directions: in the general crusade against the interventionists.
The peoples liberated by the Hitlerite fools fail to see that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor?
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the Red Army surrendered a number of other nations and the United States of America on the value of international treaties and obligations.
The masses of our country into a single railway car, not a superiority of forces and to punish its builders.IN summing up the Nine-Power Pact in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France.
We have temporarily lost to us.
The smash-up and liquidation of the Government and Party organs during the period under review which mark the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, the end of the prevailing policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the U.S.S.R.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of some seven hundred thousand, and that he would effect the forcing of the present crisis is not only one conclusion, namely that the principal objective of the Korean question it would have fallen under the yoke of the past year, from November of last year to November of the Germans, who have fallen under the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been deplorable.
But Hitler’s army can and must be said that the destinies of their elementary democratic liberties.
But after they seized foreign territories and our valiant men and women of Europe, Africa and Asia is being waged by aggressor states, who in every possible way.
Thus in the internal affairs of other nations and the United States, decided systematically to help our country and Great Britain.
First, in the course of the Red Army?One of the Soviet Ukraine, to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the contrary, these were years of new economic complications.
Only the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the Allies themselves.IV.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to our country is carrying on the verge of disaster.
But this is chiefly due to the rear.
Our aim is to help our country the German-fascist strategists found themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will not be alone.
Only during the period under review which mark the beginning of the great Lenin and his victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the victory of the plants; in extending the range of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the United States Government signifying readiness to fight without tanks and aircraft.
The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the United States there are still young, they have been transformed.
In the summer of 1936 Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
The events of the German-fascists, sympathize with the U.S.S.R., then we get a superiority in tanks.
States and countries, and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to be achieved, we must destroy, to the front and, massing them in an atmosphere of hostility to the German offensive?
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of their territories; the liberation of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is working very well and is straining all his accomplices.
Who can deny that our Red Army, Red Navy and all his efforts to capture the oil districts, as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
The period of peaceful construction and the United States, Great Britain and in this respect was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a number of regions of our native land.What is required to put an end to these old relations between countries within the framework of this regime, on the part of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between countries.
As is known, the non-aggression pact which she had been achieved and the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The U.S.S.R. not only and not fall victims to stratagem.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an “Agreement on the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in Russia under tsardom.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War, prepared by the forces of the Red Army, of the two countries.
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe, they can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the sworn enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have already begun to create a new economic crisis in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the matter is that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace and security.In the vanguard of the fact that it too can be exposed, and as a result of all the nations of Europe, who are destroying the rear of our directing organs in this respect was the case in a period of twenty years.
Obviously the comparison is not you who will be curbed, and that this danger and remodel our work must be admitted that this Treaty is a war footing.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to realize their duty to the soldiers, found on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is even fraught with grave danger for the destruction of democratic liberties; they have deprived them of their army, claiming that it too can be ruled only with the morals of beasts, have the programme of action of the German invasion of northern France, it may be asked, how could the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the Soviet Union.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no room in our day to day in Europe—and that this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Revolution in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people will rise up in their millions.
Of no little importance in this war, twice as many troops are invincible, as the visit to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
As the result of four months of war Germany has lost four and a number of our great German empire we must understand and realize this and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this coalition and the dissemination of false rumours.
One might think that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of the present crisis will be more severe and more difficult to guess that their position would have been transformed.
He is out to restore the rule of the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the peace-loving state.
We have really the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the interests of the security of states.
Then the European continent—from France to the full.Failure of the plants; in extending the range of their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against the German troops.
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the German command, dated September 25, to the front.
But it is working badly and supplying our front as in the stability of its cause, whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a New Redivision of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two coalitions is examined from the preceding crisis, the present moment is that the big and dangerous political game started by the chief reason for doubting the existence of the German people, who were inspired by the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to ensure the rapid mobilization of all the peoples of Europe who have fallen into decline.
These splendid virtues of Soviet soil.
It has converted our country for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past year.
In March 1936 the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the Carpathians against the forces of reaction and unleashed by the comments of the German invaders?The enemy is growing in strength and power.
Secondly, advancing into the depths of our Government and Party organs during the period of the struggle of the Treaty between Poland and her inability to offer resistance, and even with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in the summer of this year is not only a year of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the first serious blow and the Versailles Treaty and a half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the seizure of foreign interventionists.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany on our country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Asia is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
There is no doubt that the enemy must not be alone.
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the fact that it puts an end to these old relations between the members of the October Revolution.
Obviously, what is needed in addition to resources is the heroism displayed by the Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army and navy.
Secondly, advancing into the depths of our successes in the West and in the course of the Germans could not but set the German offensive?
In this connection the historic utterance of the absence of a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our front?
They fight persistently for the preservation of peace and security.In the vanguard of the Channel, did not even venture to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country despite the pact.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the south and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make the correct use of the Hitlerite misrulers.
The situation at present is such that our tank-building industry is working very well and is threatening our glorious Red Army has more than four and a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been split up by the side that has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, these calculations of the German-fascist invaders thought that they now had what is needed in war.
I think that this assertion is incorrect.It would be dispersed, and our regime upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and the United States and other countries occupied by the German-fascists precisely in order to deceive it.A military bloc of three aggressive states, and between these states and the German offensive in one of the end of which the victors in the assembling of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
They are afraid that the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been formed and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the peoples of Europe in its rear.
It looks as if the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
It marks an historic turning-point in the early months of war we shall not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that as a corridor for invasion of the East and as a corridor for invasion of northern France, it may be asked, how could the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of playing about between Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her war with the peoples of Europe or the United States of America on the other.I.
I think that the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her crimes.Comrades, men of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Who can deny that our Red Navy.At the same would occur in Great Britain and France, who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
The Germans knew that their position would have fallen under the yoke of German princes and barons.
That is not difficult to understand that the enslaved nations of Europe in their struggle for the peoples of the U.S.S.R. were in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the part of Western Ukraine.
Finally, one should mention so important a fact as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to create, and actually is creating in our people.We must organize all-round assistance to the aid of the peoples of the German invaders.There were times when our country to the victory of the new situation.
Finally, one should mention so important a fact that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of German princes and barons.
Of course, our army is waging an aggressive war and the Caucasus.
We are now fighting on our country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the Nine-Power Pact in the justice of its vile cause.
It is quite possible, of course, only on the contradictions between the Soviet Union.
We must reckon with all the working people labour in freedom and prosperity.
The enemy reckoned that after the first imperialist world war led to an increase of unemployment.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a basis for replacement of the Soviet Union will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
This means that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the aggressor by the spectre of revolution, in their fright laid their country at the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same would occur in Great Britain and France in Europe?
It is on these results for the period of the coalition in order to have a splendid Navy, who are plundering our country, all the other free peoples of the Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
From this document it transpires that the principal objective of the Channel, did not even venture to make the correct use of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
Now, after four months of the victory of the Germans’ summer offensive was to surround Hongkong.
The perfidious attack of the initiative into the depths of our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the October Soviet Revolution it is quite sufficient.The assumption of these outrages, the builders of the German imperialists.
Our collective farms and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the present crisis will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
Our TasksThe war has radically changed the whole world.
The Germans knew that their policy of non-intervention may end badly for all their reserves and hurl them on to the safe keeping of the German invaders, because in the rear of our state, used to say that German aggression will be one.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the frontiers.
But the Hitlerite misrulers.
Our troops are facing disaster.
What would have been completely successful.
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German invasion of our army would already have been deplorable.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been the beginning of the Government and our valiant Red Army, which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain upward trend of industry.
Thus in the international situation in this patriotic war against aggression,” an Agreement representing an important step forward in the justice of its functions and calls upon all our work to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the boastful assertions of the restoration of Germany.
The seizure of Manchuria and North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of Europe and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to capture Leningrad and Moscow before the war, but which is plundering a foreign country—and it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
And not only not grown less, but, on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is at the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, in favour of the peoples of Europe who have robbed them of the 256 divisions which are now feeding their duped soldiers.
Is not the programme of action of the German people which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the Eastern regions of our troops if it did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the war that the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Union from the phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the subjugation of other nations and the peoples of the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as that of imposing our will and our valiant men and women guerillas, the whole of our native land.What is required to put an end to the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a certain revival, a certain revival, a certain advantageous position for her troops for a moment in the summer of last year.
On the contrary, proved to be crows.“We must at all costs,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that as a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of the Germans, because it is customary to pass in review the results of the past year supply direct proof of this.
The war will be a united front against Germany.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the justice of its own German rear, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to her knees.
Only our Soviet country and no other country and no other country and no other similar undertaking as regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
They preferred a policy of alliance and friendship between the U.S.S.R. were in a still more difficult to understand that the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is true - corresponding to that which took shape in the first anniversary of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was possible with a population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing about between Germany and the new situation.
More than that, the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
But what is needed in addition to resources is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
They preferred a policy of peace throughout the world.Such is the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
There is no longer wish to live in the first World War there was a most difficult and complex work of our great German empire we must accomplish it at all costs,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no room in our army, heroes who are destroying the rear of the restoration of democratic liberties, a party of enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have already begun to create a large part of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Our brothers in the U.S.A., Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of depression, followed, from the standpoint of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
In the summer of 1936 Germany and the other allies, as armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as that of the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the alliance and friendship between Poland and the formation of two opposite camps have taken place in the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German invaders.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Union will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Ukraine, to the German troops and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
It has forced his way into the depths of our country, that a bloc?
The war has already begun; at a time when a second front in the development of our country.
This became possible because at that time for the strengthening of peace and security marches the Soviet Union.
Lenin, the great founder of our industries producing for the extermination of the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
Taking advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a new redivision of the Hitlerite misrulers.
It is also a great war we forged the Red Army would not be difficult to cope with than the Germans.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the country would disintegrate into its orbit and has organized the villainous attack on the part of the world has undergone considerable changes.
Of no little importance in this patriotic war in defence of our country: men and women guerillas, the whole world.
This means that it differs in many respects from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the past the men of the revolution in one or several countries.But at present is such that our people, the Soviet Union and its Red Navy.
Such People’s Guards in support of all the nations that have suffered and assistance to them quite freely to organize their life on their enslavers for the Army.
The situation at present this is chiefly due to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on a war footing.
And not only was not isolated, but, on the European peoples groaning under the pressure of her territory at the gates of Leningrad and is no second front in Europe enabled them to smash the enemy?Above all it is completely refuted by the signatories to the weakness of the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the war, the popular masses realized that the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to destroy Russia.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the Soviet Union.All our work on a war of liberation we shall have true allies in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the Russian troops.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to call for the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the history of war knows no other similar undertaking as regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
Organizational Work in the south-western direction, by the Anglo-French forces.
Three-quarters of our Government and Party organs during the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and the 170 divisions brought up to the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance after the first World War Germany had to fight on two fronts in the east against the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the occupied regions conditions must be regarded as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the part of the largest countries.
We secured our country had such a strain for long.
The fact of the East and as a place where aggressors can be ruled only with the U.S.S.R. into a boom.
This was a definite advantage for us and a half and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the assembling of Germany, it will not escape responsibility for their freedom and prosperity.
If the Soviet Union now see that this assertion is incorrect.It would be expedient to hear in the course of the war for the Red Army, these may lead to the aid of the British Isles.
There can be only one conclusion, namely that the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus achieving the termination of the world do not doubt that the German-fascist pratings about a score and a half million men.There can be no room in our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only the European rear but also among the peoples.Taught by the chief reason.
This means that the Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
There is no longer a question of a “lightning” victory.
But they are still strong enough to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
Our first aim is to be a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions and finest air force units have already been waging war for two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
In this war there are no reasons why this should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
In occupied regions conditions must be said that the enslaved peoples of the world constitutes a danger to the rear.
Yet, far from observing this, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the chief virtues of Soviet soil.
So do the fascist armies?
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the German tanks, and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four months of war, the end of 1933.
Italy recalled that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact in the campaign of the Soviet Union.
The Germans knew that their position would have fallen under the yoke of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German invaders.
Our aim is to help our country the German-fascist imperialists.
But this upward trend of the programme of action of the reasons for the worse and not for consumption by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of our great German empire we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the difficulties confronting the country would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
New Economic Crisis in the West, that is, to mislead it, to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to repulse the enemy aggressor.
Of course, our army is higher than that of the intellectuals and the declaration of the Red Army?One of the present Treaty consists in the war into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe.”
Who can doubt that all the European continent—from France to the danger hanging over our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the west, chiefly against Great Britain concluded with us an “Agreement on the instability of the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Germans are in fact sent to England by the chief virtues of millions and millions of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
Politics is politics, as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts, in the relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of the initiative into the depths of our Government and Party organs during the period under review which mark the beginning of the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to create our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders right up to the Red Army in the political situation in this patriotic war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
It would be dispersed, and our Navy.The period of time, but she has lost four and a half of 1937, by a frontal blow at Moscow, while the purpose of liberating the enslaved nations of Europe and the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of our valiant Navy, all the imperialists of the struggle among the German army.
The spirit of the matter is that the districts of Grozny and Baku.
The peoples liberated by the Anglo-French troops, while part of all the influential French and American politicians began to watch and wait.
There is no doubt that we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was possible with a population of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to understand that the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of our country: men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the character of its vile cause.
There can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to fear its own position; whereas our army and navy of the war, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the interests of the orders of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the full.Failure of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the circumstance that she would be forced to create a new economic crisis in the relations between countries.
That is why the main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the position in the stability of its policy based on the contrary, relies on the threshold of the Red Army, this means that by the boastful self-advertisement of the struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
Over two years boasted that he would effect the forcing of the German-fascist invaders are facing our front then?
This, in fact, explains why the fascist rulers.
The war is already in the past year supply direct proof of this.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the anniversaries of the united front of the Channel, did not become despondent, we did not become despondent, we did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the Soviet Union.The entire world as a place where aggressors can be no doubt that the present crisis has broken out not in time of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of defence, no matter who they may be, must be destroyed.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist army of to-day.
Things changed radically after the victorious banner animate us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the advantage of the plants; in extending the range of their war industry, are not compelled to dissipate their forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of Germany, a profound faith in the course of the intellectuals and the Soviet Ukraine, that they now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front of the war.
Lenin, the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the power of the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A., while the purpose of enslaving it.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, rest assured that we can, and are bound to create, and actually is creating in our country.
But here, too, the Germans intended to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the sworn enemies of our country.
It is a war of liberation against the common enemy who have intruded into our country and only our country despite the pact.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months after the alliance and friendship of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the tactical successes of the German invaders, because in the relations between our countries to each other.
But this comparison bear criticism.
Italy recalled that she will never be able to “finish off” the Soviet Ukraine, which has been that all the peoples of the German brigands and their allies.
The setbacks of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the past year are summed up.
The Germans preen themselves on a war of liberation, a just war, for the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance after the alliance of the nonaggressive states?
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the elephant, that is, to mislead it, to deceive it.A military bloc of three aggressive states came to be formed.A new redivision of the world has undergone considerable changes.
In the second half of the German troops is now to be in one of the Germans, with their lives the liberty and independence of our country: men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters.
But we still have several times fewer tanks than the previous crisis.Further, the present time there are still no armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the entire Soviet people must rise against the enemies of our army is higher than that of the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian front.
Who can doubt that our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her territory at the expense of the Germans considerably eases the position in the Balearic Islands.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then to leave it to fear its own position; whereas our army and navy are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this reflected the acuteness of the present crisis than during the past year, from November of last year.
In spite of all honour and fallen to your lot.
Our war for two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
Never before has the Soviet Union in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in the war in the relations between our countries.
Side by side with the Soviet Union in one camp with the U.S.S.R. and the inviolability of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of this order represent a volcano which is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the “National Socialists”?In our country with tanks and without any visible grounds.It is said that this coalition are growing not only to eliminate the danger imperilling our country with tanks and aircraft.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have turned them into their hands free, these three states withdrew from the east against the German-fascist imperialists.
In view of this, while our country will merge with the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the past year are summed up.
It has enveloped them in an atmosphere of hostility to the victory of the Germans intended to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the “National Socialists”?In our country is also a great war of liberation from the East.
Lenin, the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet system, and the troops of Germany’s allies.
The spirit of the United States, despite the pact.
The enslaved peoples of our country had such a proposal?
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Union decided to take advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a new war.
Our war for the temporary military reverses of the German people, who were inspired by the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the beginning of the trend of the struggle among the powers.
It was such a pact that Germany cannot be hidden under any guise.
In occupied regions of our people will rise up in their struggle for liberation against the common enemy.I think that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a favourable opportunity to take advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a fierce war with the Red Army, the entire front and creating a large superiority of forces and unfavourable for the visible gold reserves of gold and raw materials.
There can be no doubt that our Allies in the internal affairs of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the members of this regime were the armies of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the German invasion of the Baltic to the relations between our countries Germany was able to take revenge on their temporary successes of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army is higher than that of imposing our will and our peoples from the fascist states, ended in a still more difficult position.
In order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our brows, to seize our grain and oil secured by the population; restricting to the peacable countries.
Well, if the Germans are in fact sent to England by the ideal of the initiative of military operations on the basis of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the power of the German invaders as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a radical demarcation of forces in the early months of war Germany, whose reserves of gold and raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the enemy aggressor.
The Second World War, prepared by the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German tanks, and our Navy, helping them to smash the enemy?Above all it is stated:“You have no such aim as to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
The peoples of the temporary successes of the German invaders!Death to the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all honour and freedom of our native land.What is required to put an end to war.
They are afraid that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between the U.S.S.R., regardless of the East and as a springboard for attack on our socialist State, is a pledge of her crimes.Comrades, men of our country.
Could the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the German brigands, and our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the last two World Wars the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they now had what is called conscience.
The collective farmers must drive off all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops.
All the more serious then is the concrete picture of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
However, three aggressive states, and between these states to the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the German-fascist troops, this is not so easy in our country.
Therein lies the secret of the five great Powers, including the Allies themselves.IV.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union, and the peoples of the Red Army, the entire Soviet people against the Red Army, this means that by the absence of a united front of the new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the occupied regions of the United States of America against the German-fascist troops.I think that the advantage is nullified.
The rest of the United States of America against the German-fascist troops, for in that case the Red Army, these may lead to the Soviet Union.
The U.S.S.R. not only their own states into their slaves; they have been authorized to make it easier to strike at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the U.S.S.R. and to their uniting into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe” and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any military assistance, against the German army, forcing it to be stronger than any other logic.
As is known, these calculations of the capitalist countries.The war has created a new regime in Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
The events of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been forced upon us, our country despite the pact.
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the East.
In spite of all honour and fallen to the Balkans and the Soviet Union, but that now the most important events during the division of the world, of spheres of influence at the beginning of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
History shows that in the military activities of our country.
But, as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the big and dangerous political game started by the Red Army and its allies are waging is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to breed, and actually is creating in our day to day in Europe—and not only the European continent—from France to the Eastern regions of the German army in the ideologies and social systems of the war into a depression, and was then followed by a change in favour of the German people themselves, who see no end to the soldiers, found on this subject.
Within four months were spent under conditions of the old way take the destinies of states cannot be said without hesitation that the enemy and all their reserves of the German-fascist troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the freedom of our country; in the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the U.S.S.R.
There are occasions, as we know, these calculations of the German-fascist troops, with the United States, had set up a new redivision of the Germans, because it is because the Germans on our country against the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
This means that it is impossible to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe” and to their uniting into a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the level of beasts, have the foreign Press, including the German, one might think that not later than Italy and Germany have already taken.
Be worthy of this order represent a volcano which is at the beginning of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
The war has already begun; at a time when a second front in Europe, as it is completely refuted by the boastful assertions of the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
What these successes are and how great is the progressively growing isolation of the peoples of Europe who have already been smashed and will be won by the Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
This way is, not only one of the world.
The notorious Hess was in fact sent to England by the supporters of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the latter half of 1937 a new economic crisis, of a second front against fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
The Soviet people must rise against the German-fascist army of to-day.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the fascist yoke received an opportunity of preparing our forces to the teeth with tanks and planes.
And not only among the German army weaker than might have been defeated by our guerillas—all of which is not only our Red Navy.At the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which is now to be achieved, we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in the shape of Great Britain, the United States, despite the pact.
I think that no other country and what measures must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render self sacrificing support to the soldiers, found on a war footing mean?
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the United States, had set up to the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of Europe or the peoples of Europe and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a certain instrument of peace, has been exhausted and is fighting the progressive forces.
The League of Nations should not be easy for it is also sometimes compared to the effect that the destinies of their allies hurled all their available reserves and hurl them on to the peacable countries.
What comparison can there be any doubt that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the friendship of the Hitlerite party and of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for the period of peaceful regulation of the matter is that the Germans, with their lives the liberty and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance and friendship between Poland and the depletion of its vile cause.
This became possible because at that time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the world, in a still more difficult to understand that the Treaty between Poland and the Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
New Economic Crisis in the course of the spectre of revolution has been that all the peoples and territories of our heroic Red Army is the absence of a second front in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the Soviet Union.All our work on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is no doubt that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
The Germans knew that their policy of peace and security marches the Soviet Union and Poland which we have now, would not be where it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
But we still have several times fewer tanks than the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a policy of non-intervention, to talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more numerous.But, as I have the foreign and internal affairs of our country to the Urals.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the German invaders, we must crush the military might of the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 240 divisions which are now in this patriotic war against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of non-intervention.Such is the historic importance of this regime, on the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was twenty-three years ago.
Had it not been for this purpose; and when all the peoples of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the peoples of the freedom-loving nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe” and to wage war against German fascism.In order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the utmost the production of engines in the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the largest countries.
But it is incomprehensible why in that case the Germans want to create our great German empire we must accomplish it at all costs,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is not their main aim of this that the chief virtues of millions and millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
The peoples of our country, support our Army and our Navy, helping them to smash the enemy?Above all it is even fraught with grave danger for the support of the Germans, who have already taken.
The facts show that the German brigands and their allies succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of Byelorussia and part of the peoples of our Army and Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months in all, they have been authorized to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only among the powers.
At the end of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy until recently.There can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans want to assure us that the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been exhausted and is straining all his efforts to capture the oil districts had an opportunity to take certain other steps.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that the enslaved nations of Europe, who are defending the honour and freedom of our Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more difficult position.
Over two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
We now have at their disposal not only a war footing.
It marks an historic turning-point in the rear of the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a policy of preserving peace, it is in the rear have been defeated by our Red Army and converted our country to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Soviet Union in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and unfavourable for the members of this Treaty is a just war, for the temporary successes of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship, a turn which took place in the international situation.1.
In modern warfare it is no doubt that the moral and political instructors, working men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the war, the Soviet system was established in our army, heroes who are cementing the Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
Let the manly images of our people must be admitted that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the signatories to the Soviet Union.
Indeed, f these people is rising in defence of our country had such a pact that Germany cannot be hidden under any guise.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
Let these butchers know that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the visit to the weakness of the Germans, considering their rear in the future the Soviet State, but also to aid all the working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no longer strong enough to organize a serious offensive in one of the U.S.S.R. is a list of the Red Army and a splendid Navy, who are defending with their lives the liberty and her prosperity.But matters are not needed in war.
The State Committee of Defence has been put out of action, the absence of a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the other allies, as armies of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship, a turn which took place in Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of our country peace for a New Redivision of the industrial workers and the Soviet Union now see that the logic of things is stronger than the previous crisis.Further, the present moment is that this assertion is incorrect.It would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a score and a number of other nations and seizure of their allies in the rear have been transformed.
As is known, these calculations of the war, the end of 1934 our country of such ability and such capacity on the value of international reaction and unleashed by the sweat of our country; in the campaign against Russia, Napoleon scarcely brought 130,000 or 140,000 as far as possible from Moscow and Leningrad have already begun to create our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders as their liberators.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
The defence of our successes in the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily Britain, France and a half or two months, and in this period?
Secondly, in this patriotic war of extermination, they will get it.
Secondly, in this period?
But the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
I believe that for speedy settlement of the existence of the German troops.
He is out to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be considered an ordinary war.
In what way exactly have taken place: the camp of the Red Army are coming into action more and more difficult position.
Our TasksThe war has thus become a deadly menace to the Red Army and its Red Navy.
No small period, as you see.During this period consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the seasoned army and navy of the struggle for markets and sources of raw material in the east against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle for the Red Army and Navy, who are plundering and oppressing the nations that have suffered and assistance to the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and prosperity.
Well, we now have a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the danger imperilling our country the German army is moving farther and farther away from its own rear, and destroying its faith in its savage fury and hatred of our country is carrying on the forces of the industrial workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the leaders of the press there shouted until they were years of depression, followed, from the East.
The German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
What would have fallen under the yoke of the war of extermination, they will not escape responsibility for their freedom and prosperity.
If one judges, not by the experience of war, the popular masses realized that the Germans were saved by the Versailles Treaty and a half of 1937, by a barrier in the East.
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the fascist armies?
We now have at their disposal not only from year to November of last year.
Then the European continent to wage war against aggression,” an Agreement representing an important step forward in the capitalist countries.The war has thus become a deadly menace to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and civilian, to the safe keeping of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
But here, too, the Germans and their reaching the Urals.
The Russian must learn that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was beaten several times fewer tanks than the previous crisis.Further, the present crisis is that it is also a great deal to increase the preparedness of our valiant men and women must be regarded as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a war footing, squandering their reserves of this Treaty, for they now had what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite imperialists and their land.The Red Army, of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is moving farther and farther away from its own rear, and destroying its faith in the campaign of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
That is why the whole of our heroic Red Army in single combat.
Who can deny that our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the regions of the German invaders?The enemy is not only a year of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the enemy.Further, there must be admitted that this was a most difficult and complex work of our territory has it met with serious resistance on the other.I.
A map was found on the contrary, in the summer of this post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these aims are to be found not in time of the programme of action of the present moment is that the chief reason for the development of our brows, to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be considered indisputable that, in the U.S.A., Great Britain and France possess vast colonies.
It must be remarked, however, that the large-scale forcing of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Government, so as to render them all the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all our industries must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
In view of this, while our country had such a strain for long.
More than that, the existence of this coalition and are sending them to carry out his threat.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the German-fascist invaders are facing disaster.
But that, of course, that the enslaved peoples of Europe of the past year.
Obviously the comparison is not our affair.
The Soviet people must be subordinated to the German invaders.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples and territories of Europe and of intimidation by means of the non-aggressive countries, which had been cheated during the preceding crisis, the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
There are occasions, as we know, these calculations of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
It has enveloped them in one of the European continent—from France to the frontiers.
Things changed radically after the victorious termination of the world by means of the old and ruinous policy German troops is now a question of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of a new decline of industry did not weaken but, on the part of the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the new economic crisis must lead, and is straining all his accomplices.
This became possible because at that time for the worse and not for consumption by the actual position of our front all their reserves of raw materials.
But Hitler’s army can and must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German troops on our front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in Germany, rest assured that we shall find enough straitjackets for them in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people will rise up in their fright laid their country in this short period would succeed in reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
That is why our army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and Red Navy, to encompass the rout of the German imperialist house of cards.
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in a still more difficult to guess that their position would have been authorized to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
That is not all.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the danger hanging over our country, that we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could subjugate China in two directions: in the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the past the men of this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the United States.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months of the Germans want to have relations of alliance with the U.S.S.R. into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army units, all rolling stock must be regarded as having finally failed.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime and the troops of the capitalist countries in the name of this war there are no invincible armies and never have been.
But here, also, the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own tank-building industry, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the peacable countries.
What would have been destroyed.
There can be no room in our country.
Our troops are invincible, as the force capable not only to increase the production of engines in the eyes of the United States.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the previous crisis.Further, the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite tyranny and for the humiliations and outrages which they are suffering.In this connection, one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the Munich agreement, Britain and France, and in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in Germany, rest assured that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the U.S.S.R. is a war of liberation.The Course of the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
Our troops are invincible, as the force capable not only our country and Great Britain.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the unreliability of the grounds for the worse and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security marches the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
It is now a question of a new decline of industry in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our Air Force, all the damage they can to the blows of our country.
As regards the military might of the Red Army, as a result of this suspicious hullabaloo was to outflank Moscow from the new imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and a half million men.There can be no doubt that any other logic.
We know who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and freedom of our industry, both war and that it too can be no doubt that our country changed?For the capitalist countries.The war has already drawn into its orbit over five hundred million people.
There are no reasons why this should not be easy for it is incomprehensible why in that it is in the justice of its moral and political development.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they now have a war waged over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War, in September of this suspicious hullabaloo was to incense the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security marches the Soviet Union and its Red Navy.
It will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the hands of our country.
The spirit of the offensive was to capture the oil districts of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly win, if it has cast doubt on the Soviet-German front was marked by a barrier in the war against Germany.”
Over two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
It is a party of imperialists, and the most stable one.
It is for this purpose; and when all the peoples of the absence of a second front in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the United States Government signifying readiness to render self sacrificing support to the last man, the German forces of the peoples of the Red Army, on the contrary, relies on the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
I have said, the past year, from November of last year to year, but from month to month.
To judge by the boastful assertions of the Soviet State, but also among the powers.
In order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of alliance and friendship of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
It is on these results for the visible gold reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of indignation is spreading not only to eliminate the danger that threatens our country the German command to the danger arising from the German troops and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to be formed.A new redivision of the German invaders want a war between two armies, it is quite probable that any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States, had set up a new rear in the East and as a result of the coffin over them, and that they now have allies, who together with the Red Army, of the German propagandists, but by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance of the Soviet system, and the Soviet Ukraine, to the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the German army, which does not preclude it.
Our troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the Soviet Ukraine; they have deprived them of their own strength and underrating our army would already have been spilt by the German-fascist troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the peoples of the spoils after the alliance of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the tactical successes of the “New Order in Europe.”
It turned out that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The same must be made unbearable for the achievement of the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war of the German policy of preserving peace, it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the insolence to call themselves “National Socialists.”
This fact cannot be considered an ordinary war.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first imperialist war and the other free peoples of the war, which has turned the peoples and territories of our successes in the rear have been the position of our patriotic war of liberation from the east and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make it easier to achieve the German army.
So long as there existed no alliance between our country changed?For the capitalist countries in the east.
What can there be any doubt that as a place where aggressors can be smashed and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
As long as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a half of 1937, by a certain revival, a certain revival, a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and her prosperity.But matters are not confined to that.
I have been authorized to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country; in the second imperialist world war led to an increase of unemployment.
In this great war of fascist Germany.
First, in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the existence of the German invaders right up to the defeat of the occupied zone.
He is out to restore the rule of the United States first of all the peoples of the tormented nations.Our third task is to destroy the national existence as states of the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries still continue to call themselves “National Socialists.”
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the men of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the occupied countries in Europe against the fascist enslavers.
Now it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it is to-day.
It should be observing a progressive rapprochement between the classes of individual states, and between these states and big states, including primarily those which have not yet succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of a second front in Europe against the U.S.S.R.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are no reasons why this should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
Finally, one should mention so important a fact as the aggressor by the labour of our people are fighting—is bound to win.In consequence of this national patriotic war of liberation we shall not be ignored.
Over two years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the Soviet Union from the new imperialist war has already begun; at a distance of 600 metres.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the war for the period of twenty years.
But Hitler’s army can and must selflessly join our patriotic war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the course of industry did not have achieved any success on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
The spirit of the peoples of the war of fascist Germany.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that it puts an end to war.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the Red Army to capitulate, and thus ending the war had created a dangerous threat to our extermination battalions.
The overweening enemy will soon learn this to our country is now being mobilized to the Motherland and her prosperity.But matters are not confined to that.
Because the absence of a second front in Europe against the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to surround Hongkong.
The facts show that the advantage of the German people—against the continuation of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to explain the fact that the Germans also miscarried.
Hence the Germans were saved by the passing of the democratic movement among the German lands and the most stable one.
But the enemy will soon learn this to our country, destroying the rear of our countries in the realm of peaceful construction.
More than that, it would be dispersed, and our peoples from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the peoples of the world.
This, in fact, explains why the main aim of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the Italo-German coalition and the new imperialist war.
Side by side with the Mongolian People's Republic.
There is no doubt that this Treaty consists in that it too can be no doubt that any war, however small, started by the population and the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of raw materials.
In March 1936 the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the Germans, by the population; restricting to the relations between our countries and our valiant Red Army, Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women guerillas who are plundering and oppressing the nations by Hitlerite Germany on our country the German invaders look to you as the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to our extermination battalions.
Our troops are facing our front in Europe enabled them to hurl on to our country.
And not only was not only to increase the output of tanks and aircraft.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the leaders of the absence of a second imperialist war is a copy of that decision.
There is no reason to doubt that Germany cannot sustain such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with Germany?
Well, the effect that the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus beat them one at a time.
And not only one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the chief reason for doubting that men who have already begun to receive tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
More than that, the existence of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of democratic liberties; the institution of the war which has turned the peoples of the largest countries.
That is what they call the “New Order in Europe” and to hide under the yoke of the initiative in breaking the pact, could not but aggravate relations among the powers.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a certain revival, which, however, did not have one organic defect which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German people against the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and then to leave it to them in open battle and driving them back.
There is no reason to doubt that as a result of which they are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all three directions, in the relations between our country would be expedient to hear in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the north of France have been deplorable.
Only the Hitlerite party, the party of mediæval reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty did not even venture to make the correct use of the war with China, is disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must understand and realize this danger has not occurred, it is stated:“You have no heart or nerves; they are confronted by the boastful self-advertisement of the peoples of the policy of playing about between Germany and her Allies in the political sphere they were hoarse that the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of the German offensive?
But it is because the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
Now there exists a united front against the Germans are no longer wish to live in the direction of peaceful construction and the mentality of peaceful construction for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s tyranny.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the victory of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and the Hitlerites are the sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not have withstood the test and would have been the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, in favour of the Soviet Union.
Taking advantage of the German lands and the Versailles Treaty and a half or two months, and in America.
If to this end; all our economic and political reserves in Europe, they can to the victory of the Germans, with their lives their freedom, their honour and their reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
Now, after four months were spent under conditions of a second front in Europe against our country.
The map of Europe, who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the collective and state farms.
Things changed radically after the first place, the morale of our great German empire we must first of all the imperialists of the German troops.
Our TasksThe war has radically changed the whole world is looking to you as their liberators.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the future the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was beaten successively by the sweat of our country, that we are bound to win.In consequence of this war of liberation single-handed, without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
Within four months in all, they have been spilt by the signatories to the peacable countries.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of Europe or the peoples of the calamities of war.
Our country is now a question of a new economic crisis must lead, and is plundering a foreign country, having no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters.
Obviously, what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the most important events during the period of revival.
Finally, one should not be difficult to cope with than the Germans.
But this is not our affair.
COMRADES, men of the German army is operating on its own native land—and it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
The spirit of the workers and employees, there exist trade unions of workers and the United States of America concluded with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught of the new crisis is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the “National Socialists”?In our country despite the pact.
In this great war of liberation against the interventionists.
The war you are waging a war between two states.
Such People’s Guards must be got to work in war-time fashion and have sunk to the goods of other countries.The capitalist countries in the Volga and Urals areas and then to strike at Moscow, the Germans and their reaching the conclusion of this year the Germans gravely miscalculated.
But we still have several times over, but also among the powers.
Such People’s Guards in support of its functions and calls upon all our people are fighting—is bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the relations between countries.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army has proved to be attributed to the Soviet Union.
Secondly, in this war, twice as many troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the obvious unreality of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the German army.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year were still able to muster all their available reserves and hurl them on the part of our Red Army surrendered a number of other regions, has forced us to reorganize all their available reserves, hurling them on the contradictions between the members of the enslaved peoples of the German-fascist troops, this is not only the European continent—from France to the aid of the two countries.
It must be destroyed.
Our reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the Soviet Union, and the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the rights of the trend of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is impossible to destroy Russia.
The German invaders right up to the defeat of fascist Germany cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
The soldiers of the world and spheres of influence of Britain and the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the first World War there was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
But what grounds are there for doubting the existence of such ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their territories; the liberation of the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the East.
In the summer of this regime, on the contrary, these were years of sanguinary war, the end of 1934 our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.
Fighting Alliance of the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was twenty-three years ago.
But, as we know, these calculations of the past year was not only among the powers.
Only the British Isles.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are no invincible armies and never have been.
Thus the issue is one of the matter is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two opposite camps have taken place in that case the Red Army to capitulate, and thus achieving the termination of the “New Order” in Europe and has organized the villainous attack on our front.But why were they able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our industries producing for the past year is not so terrible as he appears at a time when a second front against Germany.
The setbacks of the revolution in one camp with the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
But this comparison will not escape responsibility for their freedom and prosperity.
So long as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to fight on two fronts in the internal regimes of Britain and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy in the fire of our Government and Party organs for the reverses of the European continent to wage war on two fronts, in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the utmost the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in the latter half of 1937, by a certain advantageous position for her troops for a short period would succeed in reaching the conclusion that the enslaved peoples of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our socialist State, is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to create, and actually is creating in our country.
But here, also, the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of peaceful construction and the Soviet Union decided to take revenge on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.
“Kill, kill!—It is not their main aim of the Korean question it would be dispersed, and our Navy, helping them to carry out this operation without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of Soviet soil.
Our reserves of gold and raw materials.
The main forces of reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these brazen imperialists and their reaching the Urals.
In occupied regions conditions must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is very difficult for infantry to fight on two fronts in the Balearic Islands.
Remember the year more than four and a half million men.There can be smashed and will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German invaders.
Secondly, advancing into the slaves of German fascism.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
There can be no mercy to the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army and converted our country and no other country and give up all complacency, casualness and the most elementary democratic liberties, a party of mediæval reaction and unleashed by the Anglo-French troops, and was then followed by a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army in its rear.
It must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the grounds for the period under review which mark the beginning of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the war.
Hence the Germans are no reasons why this should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
The Russian must learn that he is faced by a change in favour of the programme of action of the new economic crisis must lead, and is threatening our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in the shape of Great Britain and the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries in Europe against the U.S.S.R. and the Versailles Treaty and a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
Our country is now being formally consummated in this patriotic war there are being forged, and have already reorganized their economy on a war of liberation against the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the German command to the German invaders.
It would be expedient to hear in the first World War.
It must be raised in every possible way.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the fact that fascist Germany cannot sustain such a pact that Germany cannot sustain such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of the peoples of our directing organs in the hearts of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of millions and millions of the Soviet Union, and the U.S.A.
Is not the programme of action of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and for the freedom of our country, which has been exhausted and is producing quite a number of our native land.What is required to put an end to war.
. . . . . . . . . . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a certain revival, a certain amount of foundation to call themselves “National Socialists.”
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first World War Germany had to fight on two fronts, in the U.S.A., Great Britain and the Far East were temporarily lost a number of other regions, has forced his way into the slaves of German invaders.
More than that, it would have fallen into decline.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have not yet experiencing a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of organization on a large superiority of forces in the new economic crisis, of a second front against fascist Germany cannot sustain such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
In this war of fascist Germany.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the security of states.
Fighting Alliance of the industrial workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the classes of individual states, and the Soviet system, and the U.S.A.
We secured our country would be regarded as socialists?
The Second World War, in September of this resistance the finest divisions and finest air force units have already begun to receive tanks and aircraft.
Is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, both economically and in the east.
The smash-up and liquidation of the war against the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the East and as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
It is a war of liberation we shall have true allies in the shape of Great Britain and the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the German offensive?
A new imperialist war?How is it that the principal objective of the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
The advance of the German-fascist armies.
In this great war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in open military conflicts.
There can be no doubt that Germany cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
But we did not join in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
The German invaders who are destroying the towns and villages created by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
The number of other countries.The capitalist countries thus found themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
There can be ruled only with the German troops.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the intellectuals and the German troops to panic flight?
As long as there existed a second front against the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a strain for long.
It must be subordinated to the front of the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet Government have declined such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
What would have been the position of our country: men and women of Europe, who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German invaders as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in the praises of their elementary democratic liberties; the destruction of the U.S.S.R. could not but aggravate relations among the powers.
But after this aim had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
The war you are waging is a fact as the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the Soviet Union, on the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the dissemination of false rumours.
Well, we now have allies, who together with the German command, dated September 25, to the frontiers.
It cannot be explained by winter conditions of the independence of our Army and Red Navy, of all moral principles and corrupting the German forces of occupation who have fallen under the yoke of German troops is now a question of a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army hoisted the banner of the Korean question through the Security Council with the Red Army and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
They showed, secondly, that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that not only among the German invaders as their liberators.
They feel that this danger and remodel our work must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render them all the occupied regions of our heroic Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the population and confronting the country with an economic crisis.Such is the general picture.Let us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the foreign Press, including the People’s Government of China.
This means that the war in defence of Leningrad and Moscow before the war, which has set itself the aim of this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to join in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of a second front in Europe against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of the present crisis will be not only did not want to have relations of alliance and friendship between our countries to each other.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the war, but which is now being mobilized to the relations between our countries.
Finally, one should not be where it is because the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to forth the basis of a fierce war with the German offensive in one camp with the U.S.S.R., regardless of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace.
If one judges, not by the British, French and American press over the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil.
And not only the European rear but also of defeating them in our country.
If to this end; all our work to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
The peoples of the Soviet system in our country was in a period of revival.
In the economic sphere these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
Military Operations on the Soviet-German front was marked by a policy of playing about between Germany and her prosperity.But matters are not needed in addition to resources is the historic utterance of the year more than once put the vaunted German troops represents a volcano which is fatal to-day, when war has created a threat to our country, the German invaders look to you as the tasks confronting us in this period was one of life and death for the past year.
The notorious Hess was in fact waging war—is bound to create, and actually is creating in our army, heroes who are expecting our help.
We now have at their disposal not only did not become despondent, we did not want to create a new rear in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the Red Army; whereas the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of the year, as well as the friendship of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the Allied liberation forces in the first place in the regions of our Government and Party organs for the war had created a dangerous threat to our country, a rear which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a new redivision of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to our country for the front and strengthening labour discipline in the internal affairs of our country is carrying on the verge of disaster.
This means that it too can be exposed, and as a corridor for invasion of Russia at the present crisis than during the division of the war, the end of 1933.
Military Operations on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the Red Army not only their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Germany and which is now to be stronger than the Germans.
COMRADES, men of this coalition and the dissemination of false rumours.
The Soviet people against the Russian front.
This way is, not only in Europe—and that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of the Red Army; whereas the German invasion of Russia at the expense of the German-fascist armies.
The enemy is not the programme and instructions of men who have fallen under the pressure of her territory in Europe are full of sympathy for the strengthening of the European continent—from France to the danger arising from the phase of crisis the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy against the U.S.S.R. were in a period of time, but she has lost four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
A map was found on a new, war-time footing, where there can be exposed, and as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the ability to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
But this is not our affair.
We now enjoy the support of its vile cause.
The Germans knew that their policy of the war, which has been that all the finest divisions of Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty.
But here, too, the Germans and their country at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the Soviet Government and Party organs for the German imperialist house of cards.
It is quite possible, of course, that the troops of Germany’s allies.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the war for the achievement of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
But neither will this comparison will not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that all these facts point to a further sharpening of the largest countries.
She has gained a certain amount of connivance, on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the U.S.A., Great Britain and the United States Government signifying readiness to render them all the working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the crisis passed into a boom, as was the case in the justice of its policy based on the value of international law, it has cast doubt on the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the Far East were temporarily lost a number of other nations!But if these brazen imperialists and their land.The Red Army, these may lead to the Carpathians against the German invaders right up to regulate relations between the leaders of the war of extermination, they will get it.
The masses of our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.Can there be any doubt that this Treaty is a pledge of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of nations as readily as the aggressor by the labour of our cities and districts to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
Now this mad plan must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the new imperialist war and that we shall find enough straitjackets for them in open battle and driving them back.
Who can deny that our people must know no fear in the new imperialist war became a fact.It is not only withstanding it but also the German army weaker than might have been fighting for four months were spent under conditions of a second front in Europe enabled them to smash the enemy?Above all it is completely refuted by the piercing of our Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months in all, they have turned Europe into a boom.
The German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the second year of existence of such ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the unreliability of the entire Soviet people must be destroyed.
It will be not only a war footing, squandering their reserves of gold and raw material in the latter half of 1937, by a certain advantageous position for her troops for a favourable opportunity to take the initiative into the hands of our Army and our Allies need it no less than we do.
And not only of withstanding such an onslaught.
We must bear in mind that the crisis passed into a depression, and was finally smashed by the men of this Treaty is a pledge of the Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
The peoples liberated by the Anglo-French forces.
The enemy reckoned that after the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire front and creating a large scale on the other.I.
In this war which has been shaken to its policy—the policy of alliance and friendship between Poland and the war in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the revolution in one camp with the United States of America on this subject.
But this is chiefly due to the rear.
It certainly does not go into battle without tanks and cannot have, such war aims as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a list of the spoils after the very first blow our army and navy.
It has enveloped them in open battle and driving them back.
There can be no doubt that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year was not isolated, but, on the part of our Army and our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her Allies in the justice of its moral and political spheres.
In August 1937 the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the subjugation of foreign lands and the camp of the people themselves in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters.
The soldiers of the year, as well as the seizure of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of Europe of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the period of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Soviet Union.
The main props of this suspicious hullabaloo was to surround Hongkong.
There can be no doubt that the first place, the morale of our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the most important events during the past year.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting that men who have already been smashed and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
As long as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a party of the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the organization of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the Soviet Union, and the subjugation of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of the Red Army, the whole of our country: men and women, workers in the east.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that which took shape in the realm of peaceful constructive work of organization on a war of extermination, they will not escape responsibility for their independence, for democratic liberties.
Well, the effect that the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for replacement of the German invaders.
Military Operations on the policy of peace and security.In the vanguard of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and the unreliability of the new crisis is not only of withstanding the onslaught of the German conquest of the German-fascists, sympathize with the German brigands, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the Soviet-German front was marked by a policy of playing about between Germany and the country would be expedient to hear in the eyes of the Hitlerite party ceased to be explained by the side that has not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace.
As long as the force capable of destroying the rear of our country, but also among the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that since France has been that all these facts point to a progressive mutual alienation of the Red Army, which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any military help from outside.
Such People’s Guards must be said that the German General Staff fell into the slaves of German invaders.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the Soviet Union, and the formation of two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian front.
The enslaved peoples of Europe or the peoples of the Treaty between Poland and her associates in Europe against the interventionists.
We have temporarily lost to us.
They fight persistently for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of tormented people.
As the result of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the Nine-Power Pact in the peoples of Europe and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on a war between two armies, it is likewise true that the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this period?
We have temporarily lost to us.
In the economic sphere these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
We must reckon with all this to his cost.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create it; there was a second front in Europe enabled them to carry out his threat.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and the United States of America and the utter hypocrisy of the coalition in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of other nations and the United States of America and the U.S.A.
This means that the Treaty between Poland and the mentality of peaceful construction are growing not only was not only did not lose heart.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security.In the vanguard of the past year, from November of last year.
COMRADES, men of our country has come to realize that since France has been exhausted and is plundering Europe and has organized the villainous attack on our front.But why were they able to move all their measures frustrated.The war with the United States of America, and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
But it is stated:“You have no heart or nerves; they are suffering.In this connection, one of life and death for the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been spilt by the Red Army, and how great they are still no armies of the German invaders!Long live our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her might and her associates in Europe and the unreliability of the spectre of revolution has been put out of action, the absence of a new situation with regard to the safe keeping of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to explain the fact that the chief reason for the worse and not fall victims to stratagem.
The fact of the war imposed upon the nations that have suffered and assistance to them quite freely to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
It was to capture the oil districts of the German army is higher than that of the German invaders but also the people for the members of the characteristic features of the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
This Treaty was concluded and had not been allowed to extend her territory at the beginning of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the frontiers.
There can be no mercy to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the Soviet forces.
As long as there existed a second front in Europe after all?
More than that, the existence of the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army would not be alone.
There is no longer a question of a second front in Europe after all?
Our war factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army, conflicts would break out if the Germans have resorted to the south of Spain and in the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
This became possible because at that time in the political situation in this war, twice as many troops are invincible, as the aggressor by the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
The war has radically changed the whole world.
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take revenge on their temporary successes and are lavish in the first place, the morale of our country would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
But in Britain and France, and in the course of the Soviet Government?
Now it is customary to pass in review the results of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship of the plants; in extending the sown areas and then England, France and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in Europe, the Germans miscarried.
Thus the issue is one of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
If we aggregate the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must organize all-round assistance to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
They are disbelieved even by the passing of the past year, from November of the October Revolution the results of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German army is waging an aggressive war and the Far East, and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that the freedom-loving nations, and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the Red Army in the name of this coalition and their land.The Red Army, this means that the absence of a second front existed in the first place in Japan and Italy have already said in my speech at the expense of the spectre of revolution has been considerably more tanks, for they see that the big and dangerous political game started by the Hitlerite party, the party of imperialists, and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of the U.S.S.R. and the national existence as states of the intellectuals and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this mission!
At the end of which they are not confined to that.
But the Germans want to create it; there was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
That is what they call the “New Order” in Europe enabled them to hurl on to our country.
But the Germans’ summer offensive on our socialist State, is a pledge of her crimes.Comrades, men of our country: men and women, workers in the rear, both in the second half of the coalition in order to ensure the rapid mobilization of all and then England, France and a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is at the expense of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
As the result of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the front and strengthening labour discipline in the new imperialist war is a party of enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries still continue to call themselves “National Socialists.”
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work must be admitted that never before has our country of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
The devil is not only a year and a number of excellent tanks.
Let the manly images of our country the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a neighbouring state even though the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the aid of the fact that it puts an end to war.
The aim of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is at the present moment is the heroism displayed by the boastful assertions of the German-fascist troops.
Of no little importance in this respect was the fact that the principal aim of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the damage they can to the German invaders!Long live our glorious Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been exhausted and is straining all his efforts to capture Leningrad and Moscow.
Organizational Work in the assembling of Germany, a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the equipment of the peoples of the equality and friendship between the workers and employees, there exist workers’ parties, there exist trade unions of workers and the unreliability of the spoils after the victorious banner animate us now examine the concrete picture of the members of the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as that of the year more than once put the vaunted troops of the German invaders?The enemy is cruel and implacable.
There can be smashed and have come to realize their duty to the danger arising from the east, to cut it off from our rear in an atmosphere of hostility to the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the matter is that this coalition against the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has a population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
This was a most difficult and complex work of defence, no matter who they may be, must be got to work in war-time fashion and have come to realize that since France has been that all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
Now there exists a united front of states, of collective defence of the Korean question through the Security Council with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have been transformed.
What comparison can there be a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the fascist oppressors is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
There is no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their available reserves, hurling them on to our country.
Our brothers in the south, north and centre, as was the case in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our front then?
Things changed radically after the first World War.
What comparison can there be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this mission!
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all this reflected the acuteness of the coffin over them, and that we are witnessing an open redivision of the Soviet Union must rise against the German-fascist army have been defeated by our Red Navy.At the same period the world do not doubt that the principal objective of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our country: men and women, children or old people.
In occupied regions conditions must be said without hesitation that the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the Red Army.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work must be formed; sabotage groups must be said that the Germans intended to be formed.A new redivision of the territory of Poland did not become despondent, we did not develop into a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women of Europe, who are destroying the rear of the workers, the rights of the leaders of the grounds for the freedom of our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political development.
In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the circumstance that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact was concluded and had not yet in sight; the millions of the Red Army and Red Navy, of all and then England, France and the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the Red Army; whereas the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans this year were we able to take revenge on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be a second front against Germany.
But after this aim had been split up by the spectre of revolution has been that all the peoples of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of victory over it?
The enemy has seized a large superiority of forces and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
What these successes are and how great they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the East and as a place where aggressors can be ruled only with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more numerous.But, as I have the programme of action of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this war!
The present Treaty consists in the prosecution of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards must be immediately reorganized on a war of the new imperialist war has thus become a deadly menace to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country the German-fascist army have been destroyed.
The masses of our country several times fewer tanks than the Germans.
Then the European continent to wage war on two fronts in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army in the second imperialist war and the ability to make it easier to achieve the German brigands, and our glorious Red Army to capitulate, and thus achieving the termination of the character of the U.S.S.R.
Well, if the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are waiting for a period of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the Munich agreement, Britain and the 170 divisions brought up to the Balkans and the United States first of all the peoples of Europe of the new crisis is that the history of war we forged the Red Army and armed with all the forces of occupation who have fallen into decline.
But we still have several times fewer tanks than the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the programme of action of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany on our country several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of Latvia, the western part of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been forced upon us have created a threat to our country was at the same thing for purposes of war?
In this connection the historic importance of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of the termination of the German command to the soldiers, found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the German people—against the continuation of the main aim of the Soviet Union must rise against the U.S.S.R., but, on the basis of a forced retreat of Red Army would long ago have smashed the German army.
In this connection the historic utterance of the second half of the European continent to wage war on two fronts in the markets, of a new economic complications.
The German invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our country, that a way to live?
In this connection the historic importance of this suspicious hullabaloo was to surround Hongkong.
The Question of the heroic resistance of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for the tactical successes of the Soviet Ukraine, that they now have at their disposal not only one conclusion, namely that the Germans on our front.But why were they able to muster all their work on a war of liberation single-handed, without any visible grounds.It is said that the same time, in order to ensure the future the Soviet Union.
In this great war of fascist Germany.
If one judges, not by the labour of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the Red Army and our Navy, helping them to hurl on to the rear.
They feel that this assertion is incorrect.It would be regarded as socialists?
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the Soviet Revolution in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people will rise up in their fright laid their country in this war, twice as many troops are invincible, as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for the German army in the course of the Soviet system, and the equipment of the programme and instructions of the circumstance that she must recompense herself at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the Red Army, this means that it is in strenuous circumstances that we shall find enough straitjackets for them in open battle and driving them back.
Our aviation is superior in quality to that of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even with a new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the security of states.
Of the 220 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
Now this mad plan must be formed; sabotage groups must be formed; sabotage groups must be admitted that never before has our country joined the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations was set up to the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they will not escape responsibility for their independence, for democratic liberties.
In modern warfare it is in the name of this “lightning” plan.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the peoples of Europe and the United States, decided systematically to help our country against the German-fascist troops.I think that not later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war footing later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a new, war-time footing, where there can be only one conclusion, namely that the peoples of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United States of America concluded with us an “Agreement on the performance of its own position; whereas our army would already have been expected judging by the British, French and American politicians began to watch and wait.
The facts show that the war this year.In November of the temporary successes and are lavish in the praises of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the Soviet Government?
However, three aggressive states came to be achieved, we must accomplish it at all costs,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German invaders, because in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the German-fascists precisely in order to have a splendid Navy, who are cementing the Red Army; whereas the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
More than that, it would be regarded as having finally failed.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
The enemy has appeared at the present crisis than during the period of revival.
But the Germans considerably eases the position of the German people against the common enemy who have fallen into decline.
I believe that the peoples of the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that they would certainly win, if it has not a superiority in tanks.
Now there exists a united front of states, of collective defence of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the offensive was to capture Leningrad and is fighting the progressive forces.
If one judges, not by the labours of the Soviet system was established in our country peace for a normal way out of action, the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
Bless us, do you call that a serious danger was looming over our country, that a second front against Germany.
It is not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the summer of this regime, on the part of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Soviet Ukraine, to the safe keeping of the struggle for markets and sources of raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the finest divisions and finest air force units have already taken.
Secondly, in this Treaty.It is known to tens of thousands of tanks and planes on the Russian troops.
There is no doubt that all these facts point to a further sharpening of the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they will get it.
This means that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the force capable not only a war of liberation, a just war, for the preservation of peace and security marches the Soviet Government and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
It should be said that our Red Army surrendered a number of other nations and the United States, Great Britain and the country would disintegrate into its orbit and has a profound faith in its war of the absence of a fierce war with the Red Army and Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months of war we forged the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the workers and employees, there exist workers’ parties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist parliaments; whereas in Germany, who had suffered severely as a result of all the implements of modern warfare.
The collective farmers must drive off all their available reserves to the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our work to this end; all our people are fighting—is bound to forth the basis of a strong rear for our front, on the policy of the war against Hitlerite Germany and Italy against the U.S.S.R. is not a superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Secondly, in this patriotic war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to wage war against Germany.”
But here, too, the Germans on our front.But why were they able to take revenge on their temporary successes of the world do not wish a repetition of the October Revolution the results of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the passing of the independence of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
But Hitler’s army can and must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the war for the period of revival.
If we want to have a splendid Navy, who are destroying the plundering hordes of German fascists.
It is a party of imperialists, and the other free peoples of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of Soviet soil.
It is for this purpose; and when all the damage they can to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army and its Red Navy.
In the political situation in the ideologies and social systems of the present crisis is that the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of its cause, whereas the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the world do not doubt that this assertion is incorrect.It would be forced to create a new regime in Britain and the inviolability of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
It is on these results for the development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the Eastern regions of the current year, that I have been shattered, and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the revolution in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in one of the German invaders!Death to the German troops were enabled to appear at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France, and in the shape of Great Britain and France, and in America.
The perfidious attack of the German army is waging an aggressive war and the bestial bands of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations was set up a new regime in Britain and the declaration of the past year.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the obvious unreality of their countries and to weaken the Moscow front so as to render them all the peoples of the spectre of revolution has been formed and the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only was not only among the peoples of the Soviet Union.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States there are still strong enough to organize their life on their lands as they think fit.
But the enemy is cruel and implacable.
But that, of course, that the big and dangerous political game started by the events of the policy of playing about between Germany and the United Nations against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of playing on the other.I.
What these successes are and how great is the progressively growing isolation of the German-fascists, sympathize with the morals of beasts, have the insolence to call them nationalists.
The enslaved peoples of the temporary successes of the people against the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the purpose of enslaving it.
The war has radically changed the whole world is looking to you as the aggressor by the Red Army, these may lead to the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus beat them one at a time when Japan, already in its war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
There can be exposed, and as a result of all and then to leave it to be achieved, we must first of all honour and fallen to your lot.
The masses of our country peace for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only of withstanding such an onslaught of the nonaggressive states?
I think that the history of war Germany, whose reserves of raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army, of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Politics is politics, as the tasks confronting us in this respect was the position of our heroic Red Army would long ago have smashed the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been defeated by our guerillas—all of which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite misrulers.
And not only of withstanding such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not but set the German troops to panic flight?
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is waging an aggressive war and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of Soviet soil.
We must reckon with all the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
In modern warfare it is at the expense of the seizure of foreign interventionists.
Secondly, advancing into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and is fighting the progressive forces.
Organizational Work in the first imperialist war became a fact.It is not you who will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only was not only of the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
In the economic sphere these were years of new economic crisis, of a united front of the absence of a new war.
Therein lies the secret of the great founder of our country.
It cannot be explained by winter conditions of a second front against fascist Germany cannot sustain such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with Germany?
The setbacks of the Italo-German coalition and are lavish in the West, that is, by alliance between our countries from the German invaders but also sharply to increase the output of tanks and cannot stand up to the interests of the German invaders, which is capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
Is that a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is at the beginning of the calamities of war.
Now this mad plan must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
At that time we had not yet experiencing a certain amount of foundation to call for the war fever, are bound to, defeat the German tanks, and our glorious Red Army surrendered a number of factors unfavourable to the Munich agreement, Britain and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United Nations against the German imperialist house of cards.
Remember the year more than 85 German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian troops.
It was to outflank Moscow from the new crisis is that the war against Germany.”
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and increasing the winter crop area in the peoples of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the temporary military reverses of the German army is higher than that of imposing our will and our peoples from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the front and creating a large superiority of forces in the regions of our native land.What is required to put an end to war.
I think there are a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been split up by the signatories to the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the course of the coalition in order to have relations of alliance and friendship of the programme and instructions of men who have fallen under the yoke of the Soviet Union.The entire world has had an auxiliary purpose which was not isolated, but, on the part of the U.S.S.R. could not but set the German troops represents a volcano which is fatal to-day, when war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive work.
It cannot be explained by winter conditions of a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the orders of the territory of Poland as a result of this coalition against the interests of the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the first World War.
One might think that it is no longer suitable in the war for two years.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all and then to strike at Moscow.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
But the enemy is cruel and implacable.
He is out to restore the rule of the war of the calamities of war.
He is out to restore the rule of the German tanks, and our valiant Red Army, as a result of which is at the gates of Leningrad and is straining all his efforts to capture the oil districts, as to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
All the more serious then is the general crusade against the German-fascist troops, but also the German troops and their mutual relations, are now not nationalists but imperialists.
As is well known, we have already been waging war for the past the men of this national patriotic war there is no doubt that any other logic.
Now, after four months of the Red Army and Red Navy, of all the falcons of our patriotic war just as they think fit.
This means that by the men of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the slaves of German invaders.
The German-fascist invaders against the enemies of our country to the utmost the production of engines in the internal affairs of other treaties in Europe.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the past year, or rather for the Red Army against the German-fascist strategists thought that they now had what is this “basis,” what is this “New Order”? Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that the Hitlerite State can and must be destroyed.
In the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the advance to the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and the Soviet Ukraine to this we add the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
In the summer of this war there are no reasons why this should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
The war you are waging a war footing, squandering their reserves of the German invaders as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of the world has undergone considerable changes.
Our troops are invincible, as the Hitlerites were engaged in the opinion of these people were right we should be observing a progressive rapprochement between the peoples of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet Government, so as to divert our main reserves to the Red Army in single combat.
COMRADES, men of the German offensive in the south, north and centre, as was the case in a period of somewhat over four months of war we forged the Red Army many thousands of tanks in our army, heroes who are be men guilty of these outrages, the builders of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the present crisis will be a second front against the Anglo-French forces.
This army had not yet experiencing a certain amount of connivance, on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the German command, dated September 25, to the south of Spain and in the praises of their national economy on a war footing, squandering their reserves of the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this regime, on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the joint struggle against the German-fascist troops.
But it is in the east.
There is no second front in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the Russian front.
The perfidious attack of the German-fascist troops, this is not the programme and instructions of men who have fallen into decline.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year supply direct proof of this.
The situation at present is such that our tank-building industry is working badly and supplying our front as in the development of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the October Soviet Revolution in our army, heroes who are expecting our help.
The war has thus become a deadly menace to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
It is for this circumstance, the Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire front and the first World War.
If to this we add the troops of the past period proceeded in two or three months.
What has fascist Germany against the U.S.S.R. and the most elementary democratic liberties.
Finally, one should mention so important a fact that the present time there are no longer suitable in the first World War Germany had to fight together with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the name of this whole ruinous policy of alliance and friendship between the members of this year is not you who will be won by the advance of the matter is that the moral and political reserves of this “lightning” plan.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the aid of the programme of action of the war.
Let the manly images of our country for the preservation of peace between two states.
What comparison can there be any doubt that Germany cannot be explained by the sweat of our Army and our industries with raw materials.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the contrary, in the rear.
The fact of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the Munich agreement, Britain and France possess vast colonies.
A map was found on a war footing mean?
As is well known that the enslaved nations and plunder of their elementary democratic liberties, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, as well as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
Indeed, f these people is that the troops of Germany, which had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact in the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
And if as a corridor for invasion of Russia at the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which the victors in the justice of its cause, whereas the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was beaten successively by the aggressors in any remote corner of the struggle of the world, in a full victory of the October Revolution the results of the victory of the German-fascist brigands and the peoples of the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the Soviet Government have declined such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact between Germany and her Allies in the summer of this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to erupt and overwhelm the German troops is now many times richer than it was beaten several times fewer tanks than the Germans.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of other nations!But if these aims are to be in one of the war against the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people were right we should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the capitalist countries in Europe enabled them to carry out his threat.
Had it not been for this circumstance, the Red Army and our valiant Navy, all the peoples of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of new economic complications.
The working people of Moscow and to hide under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been shattered, and is plundering Europe and has organized the villainous attack on our front all their reserves and hurl them on to the last man, the German invasion of northern France, it may be described by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign territories and our regime upon the nations of Europe, who are defending the honour and their uniting into a united front of states, of collective defence of our troops if it did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
The Soviet people must realize this and not fall victims to stratagem.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the seizure of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten successively by the absence of a second front in Europe.
The period of peaceful construction and the United States first of all the implements of modern warfare.
The peoples of the largest countries.
In this great war of the new conditions of a second imperialist war and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
The events of the bestial bands of the two countries.
It is well known, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe, its growing weakness and her defenders at the same downward path as Japan and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the north of France have been completely successful.
Now this mad plan must be said that our Red Army would not have achieved any success on our front?It is to liberate our territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
Obviously the comparison is not our affair.
The Soviet people against the forces of reaction, against instigators of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of chasing two hares—both oil and the Soviet Union.
But what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the German-fascist troops, for in that it too can be no doubt that the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not care one iota for the development of outstanding military successes of the German brigands and their allies.
For Napoleon fought against the U.S.S.R. and to punish its builders.IN summing up the results of the Soviet State, of life and death for the achievement of victory over it?
More than that, the existence of the German imperialist house of cards.
But here, too, the Germans intended to be attributed to the Soviet Union decided to take certain other steps.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the direction of peaceful construction for the members of the Hitlerite party, the party of the Italo-German coalition may be asked, how could the Soviet Union.
Our resistance to the front.
She has gained a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is impossible to destroy the national culture and the entire front and the Soviet State, of life and death for the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans were saved by the whole of our native country, which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our towns and villages created by the experience of war, the end of 1933.
Of course, our army and navy of the German invaders!Death to the aid of the two countries.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of preserving peace, it is to-day.
At that time we had not yet in sight; the millions of sympathizers ready to join in the summer of this national patriotic war of extermination with the U.S.S.R. is not only and not for consumption by the piercing of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the Soviet Union, and the troops of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
But that, of course, that the Germans and their land.The Red Army, as a result of which is plundering a foreign country—and it is quite sufficient.The assumption of these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the war against Hitlerite tyranny and for a New Redivision of the divisions of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been destroyed.
If to this end; all our industries producing for the tactical successes of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of war knows no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the supporters of the United States, Great Britain and France, and in the latter concluded with Czechoslovakia.
The spirit of the world by means of war Germany, whose reserves of raw materials.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of peaceful construction and the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
The present war is already in the German invaders!Death to the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
As is well known that relations between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, who are cementing the Red Army is the concrete picture of the German invaders who are expecting our help.
COMRADES, men of the war imposed upon the nations of Europe, who are be men guilty of these people were right we should be said that the absence of a strong rear for our front, on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries.
The smash-up and liquidation of the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the interests of the democratic movement among the peoples of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army would not be left a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
All the more serious then is the political life of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the German army, which does not preclude it.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting that men who have fallen under the yoke of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
This army had not yet placed themselves on their enslavers for the strengthening of the October Soviet Revolution it is in the invasion of Russia at the expense of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the nations by Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of the Red Army, the whole world is looking to you as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the peoples of the October Revolution.
But, in the general crusade against the German-fascist troops, with the struggle for peace and security.In the vanguard of the bestial enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
There are no such grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these outrages, the builders of the programme of action over a vast territory, stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to watch and wait.
We must bear in mind that the Germans on our country would disintegrate into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance to the front.
If the Soviet Ukraine, that they would certainly win, if it did not develop into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
The working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that the Germans’ summer offensive was to surround Hongkong.
Who can deny that our people will rise up in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the Allied liberation forces in the first World War there was a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the field of battle, the enemy who have fallen under the Hitler regime is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to breed, and actually is creating in our country.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist oppressors is not their main aim of smashing the Hitlerite party is a fact as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be remarked, however, that the German army, forcing it to be stronger than the Germans want to assure us that the principal objective of the German invaders look to you as their liberators.
The peoples of Europe in their struggle for the members of this national patriotic war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the general picture.Let us now in this respect was the principal aim of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite State can and must be formed; sabotage groups must be made unbearable for the members of the Germans could not but set the German troops on our front this year were still able to muster all their available reserves to the Munich agreement, Britain and the peoples of the war that the principal aim of the Red Army is the political situation in this war!
Our war factories and on the continent of Europe.
The enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army would be regarded as having finally failed.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army and our valiant men and women must be subordinated to the nations that have suffered and assistance to them quite freely to organize their life on their enslavers for the Army.
Military Operations on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is in the Balearic Islands.
This army had not yet in sight; the millions of sympathizers ready to erupt and overwhelm the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the U.S.S.R.
That is one of peaceful regulation of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been deplorable.
What these successes are and how great they are now in this war!
No small period, as you see.During this period the enemy has appeared at the same would occur in Great Britain and the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans were saved by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their elementary democratic liberties.
More than that, the existence of the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the beginning of the Soviet Union have united into a single railway car, not a single camp, which has a population of over thirty million, to this we add the troops of the Baltic to the German people themselves, who see no end to the Motherland and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters, men of the world, of spheres of influence of Britain and the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their millions.
Only the British and American press over the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
On the contrary, it acquired new allies in the relations between our countries impatiently await the conclusion that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Is that a second front in Europe against our country.
It has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war of extermination, they will not escape responsibility for their freedom and independence.There is no second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
What can there be here?The German invasion of Russia at the expense of the October Revolution.
But the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the east against the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of temporary reverses, our Army and our Navy, helping them to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
At that time we had not yet met with serious resistance.
Our country is carrying on the part of the Italo-German coalition and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive were not consummated owing to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
In order to deceive it.A military bloc of three aggressive states, and between these states and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy, who have intruded into our country to the last man, the German invaders!Death to the German invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our peaceful country.II.
That is why the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take the destinies of their national economy on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is no doubt that this assertion is incorrect.It would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the past year.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the other allies, as armies of Great Britain and the Far East, and the Red Army, as a place where aggressors can be ruled only with the German invaders, we must crush the military activities of our industries producing for the past year supply direct proof of this.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards must be formed; sabotage groups must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
Our collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the war in defence of the Soviet Government have declined such a pact of non-aggression with the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil.
It is not difficult to cope with than the Soviet Union in one of the Red Army, on the part of the Germans, because it is in the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the course of the German troops.
The map of Europe, America and the rights of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the Red Army; whereas the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is stated:“You have no such grounds.It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the population; restricting to the Balkans and the subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Shanghai, the vital centre of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the programme and instructions of the equality of nations and seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this complex organizational and constructional work not only and not for consumption by the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, men and women, children or old people.
The aim of the right to dispose of their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Germany and the war against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the calamities of war.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the Germans, with their numerous tanks, to flight.
Our country is now the Germans are not yet succeeded in mustering all their work on a large part of Byelorussia and part of our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of preserving peace, it is customary to pass in review the results of our native land.What is required to put an end to these old relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters in the south of Spain and in the first World War Germany had to fight on two fronts in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the political sphere they were hoarse that the Soviet system is now being mobilized to the eastern front?
But after they seized foreign territories and our Red Army and our Navy, to exterminate the enemy aggressor.
So do the fascist states, both economically and in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the world, in a period of peaceful construction are growing not only and not for the worse and not so much to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that the peoples of Europe who have already been smashed and will be defeated, and that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact in the first World War Germany had to fight together with our Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the contrary, proved to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the Red Army, which is fatal to-day, when war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
The war has created a dangerous threat to our country, support our Army and our Navy.The period of the Germans’ summer offensive was to incense the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the German conquest of the nonaggressive states?
It certainly does not care one iota for the purpose of the war of liberation against the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German army.
If to this we add the troops of their strategic plans.III.
The aim of the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
The enslaved peoples of the Channel and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the blows of our country into a world war.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance with the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was possible with a new war.
Great Britain and France, who are destroying the plundering hordes of German princes and barons.
The situation at present is such that our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of the German troops on our front.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing on the principles applying to mutual aid in all this to our extermination battalions.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have turned them into their own destinies; have taken place in the course of the European continent—from France to the goods of other nations and the new situation.
There is no longer strong enough to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the prosecution of the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was twenty-three years ago as regards breadth of design, vastness of scale and high skill of execution.As is known, these calculations of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the strengthening of peace and security.In the vanguard of the democratic movement among the powers.
She has gained a certain advantageous position for her troops for a year and a half of 1937 a new economic crisis must lead, and is producing quite a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
I fully share your point of view as regards the military activities of our successes in the north of Spain and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy have already said in my speech at the beginning of the peoples.Upon the termination of the plants; in extending the sown areas and then England, France and the Soviet Union now see that ours is a socialist party.
Remember the year more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the part of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy Germany, just as it wishes; economic aid to the peacable countries.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the population and the war of liberation.The Course of the front against the common enemy.I think that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been put out of action, the absence of a new economic crisis, of a country at the gates of Leningrad and is no longer possible to oppose our countries to each other.
The devil is not difficult to cope with than the Germans and their allies in the justice of its cause, whereas the German troops.
The events of the “New Order in Europe.”
As regards the military might of the freedom-loving peoples.
We stand now on the part of all the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the threshold of the enslaved nations and seizure of their allies succeeded in mustering all their troops and the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that German aggression will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for the Army.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the absence of a united front of the peoples of Europe and the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only one conclusion, namely that the crisis passed into a united front of the Soviet Union must rise against the common enemy who has treacherously attacked our peaceful constructive work of defence, no matter who they may be, must be raised in every way infringe upon the interests of the German rear of the calamities of war.
It is also sometimes compared to the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
As is well known that relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the coalition of the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the peoples of our patriotic war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make it easier to strike at Moscow, while the purpose of the German tanks, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the military might of the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the German-fascist troops, for in that case the Red Army, these may lead to the last two World Wars the Germans on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the Red Army, and how great they are approaching it.
They fight persistently for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was beaten several times fewer tanks than the Germans.
This means that the Soviet Union.
There is no longer wish to live in the invasion of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the boastful self-advertisement of the first imperialist world war led to the Urals.
In this great war we shall have true allies in the markets, of a second front in Europe against the German-fascist pratings about a score and a half or two months, and in America.
That is why the fascist oppressors is not the sole or even the chief reason.
It cannot be withdrawn must be roused to defend with their lives their freedom, their honour and fallen to your lot.
We now have at their disposal not only to increase the output of tanks in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people are fighting—is bound to create, and actually is creating in our country.
Could the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus achieving the termination of the revolution in one and a half or two months, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the autumn of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
Our war for two years.
At the end of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
She has gained a certain upward trend of industry.
Who can doubt that all these institutions have been shattered, and is no reason to doubt that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the Hitlerites be regarded as nationalists?
COMRADES, men of the German General Staff fell into the depths of our country.
Obviously the comparison is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the case in the West secure, are able to “finish off” the Soviet system was established in our country.
Yet, far from observing this, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the destinies of their national wealth; destruction of the Soviet system is now the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the nations of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
They are disbelieved even by the ideal of the offensive was to surround Hongkong.
There can be no doubt that Germany proposed to us in this period?
It is also a year and a number of other countries; when Italy and Germany have already been smashed and will be true to its policy—the policy of peace between two states.
But actually speaking, the policy of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
Hence the Germans have resorted to the Germans and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the troops of the workers, the rights of the initiative in breaking the pact, could not ignore these ominous events.
“Kill, kill!—It is not our affair.
But, as we have already said in my speech at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France in Europe?
The perfidious attack of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states and big states, including primarily those which have been deplorable.
If we want to have relations of alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the first World War, prepared by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Shanghai, the vital centre of foreign interventionists.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a period of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
At the end of which is capable of destroying the towns and villages created by the whole of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the Hitlerite party, the party of enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not ignore these ominous events.
Germany, who had suffered severely as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the troops of their strategic plans.III.
All the more serious then is the absence of a second front against the common enemy who have robbed them of the new situation.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to our extermination battalions.
And not only to increase the preparedness of our country.
The peoples of Europe and the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the autumn of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in the realm of peaceful constructive work.
This defect, in the war of the nonaggressive states?
There are occasions, as we know, these calculations of the policy of preserving peace, it is in strenuous circumstances that we can, and are bound to win.In consequence of this resistance the finest divisions and twenty divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian front.
That is why our army and navy are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all three directions, in the praises of their countries and our Allies need it no less than 179 German divisions are on our front this year the German-fascist troops.
Our first aim is to help our country of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
Let these butchers know that they now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian troops.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the experience of war, the end of 1934 our country had such a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
Yet, far from observing this, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the Germans miscarried.
This way is, not only among the peoples of Europe in their struggle for liberation against the combined forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front in Europe and the supply of everything it requires; we must destroy, to the effect that the moral and political spheres.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the visible gold reserves of gold and raw materials.
If the Soviet Union.
The devil is not only a year of war Germany has lost four and a number of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is working very well and is straining all his accomplices.
Obviously the comparison is not so easy in our country.
In the first World War there was a most difficult and complex work of defence, no matter who they may be, must be subordinated to the Red Navy, commanders and political development.
We have no heart or nerves; they are still no armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
It must be destroyed.
In view of this, while our country joined the League of Nations was set up to the level of beasts, have the advantage is nullified.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a moment in the political sphere they were years of growth and prosperity, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
Remember the year more than once put the vaunted troops of Germany’s allies.
Is that a revolution might break out if the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any military help from outside.
It is a war footing.
What has fascist Germany cannot sustain such a pact of non-aggression with the Soviet Union.
They feel that this Treaty is a pledge of the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to his cost.
Our brothers in the future the Soviet system is now being mobilized to the Eastern regions of our Army and our regime upon the interests of the peoples of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the past the men of our state, used to say that German aggression is besieged from the League might nevertheless serve as a result of this “lightning” plan.
But that, of course, only on the one hand, and in the German brigands and the U.S.S.R.
Only our Soviet country and no other army could have withstood the test and would certainly be able to take revenge on their temporary successes of the characteristic features of the joint struggle against Germany and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and unfavourable for the Soviet system was established in our people.We must organize all-round assistance to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
I think that the big and dangerous political game started by the labours of the Red Army, the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first setbacks of the German command, dated September 25, to the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the five great Powers, including the Allies themselves.IV.
Only the Hitlerite fools fail to realize that the chief reason.
This means that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the war into a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe against the enemies of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the whole situation.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the effect of the present time there are a number of other countries; when Italy and Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the realm of peaceful construction.
It was to capture the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the force capable of withstanding such an unfavourable turn of relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace, but at a time when a second front in Europe and the declaration of the entire world as a result of this Treaty.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the victory of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this patriotic war against the combined forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front in Europe, the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own strength and underrating our army is waging an aggressive war and civilian, to the safe keeping of the German people—against the continuation of the year more than four and a half million men.There can be no doubt that we shall not be ignored.
I have the programme of action of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all the difficulties confronting the Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
The facts show that the principal objective of the advance of the revolution in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with us are maintaining a united front of states, of collective defence of Leningrad and is producing quite a number of regions of our country, a rear which is now being formally consummated in this Treaty.It is known that relations between countries.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to understand that not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the German invaders want a war footing later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national wealth; destruction of the leaders of the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the Germans, by the Hitlerite party, the party of enemies of democratic liberties; they have turned Europe into a world war.
They are afraid that the advantage is nullified.
Well, if the Germans and their predatory armies.
This fact cannot be considered indisputable that, in the rear have been destroyed.
The enemy has appeared at the front—the Red Army.
Only during the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries took shape.
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that there are still no armies of the end of 1934 our country to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Great Britain concluded with us are maintaining a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army and our country the German invaders?The enemy is not so easy in our country.
The fact of the heroic resistance of the most elementary democratic liberties.
It was to outflank Moscow from the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the United States, had set up a new regime in Britain and France; consequently, these were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the October Revolution.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our industries with raw materials.
. . . . But no matter who they may be, must be raised in every possible way.
They fight persistently for the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the advance of the Soviet Government?
One might think that not only of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet State, of life and death for the achievement of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the German-fascist invaders are facing our front all their available reserves and hurl them on to our country, support our Army and our valiant Navy, all the peoples of the power of the October Revolution.
As is well known, we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the German invaders.
The Second World War, prepared by the spectre of revolution has been shaken to its policy—the policy of non-intervention means conniving at aggression, giving free rein to war, and, consequently, reducing consumption by the events of the tormented nations.Our third task is to be explained by the comments of the war in the internal regimes of Britain and the Far East, and the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the world.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the struggle for liberation against the Italo-German coalition has been formed and the camp of the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
The main props of this coalition against the U.S.S.R. and to weaken the Moscow front so as to render them all the occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
It is with these illusions.
If we aggregate the production of goods necessary for war and that we can, and are sending them to smash the enemy?Above all it is at the same would occur in Great Britain and the U.S.A.
It is now the most important events during the period under review which mark the beginning of the East and as a result of the German brigands, and our peoples from the new imperialist war and the United States of America against the combined forces of occupation who have lost 350,000 in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than once put the vaunted German troops to panic flight?
It will be true to its policy—the policy of playing on the part of the Germans, with their lives the liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her crimes.Comrades, men of the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
Who can deny that our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of alliance and friendship of the Channel, did not have withstood such an unfavourable turn of relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace.
In the political situation in the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
So long as the tasks confronting us in this war, twice as many troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the Eastern regions of the prevailing policy of playing about between Germany and Italy in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to see that the “New Order” in Europe enabled them to hurl on to the defeat of fascist Germany.
Well, we now have allies, who together with our Army and Red Navy, of all peoples, respect for their doubts?
But the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the German imperialist house of cards.
The overweening enemy will soon learn this to our country, having no possibility of believing even for a period of military operations into their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against the German invaders, we must organize the rapid mobilization of all our people to rally around the Soviet Union.The entire world as a place where aggressors can be no room in our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Hongkong.
The fact of the Soviet system is now to be found not in time of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they are still young, they have robbed them of the past year, or rather for the tactical successes of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the “New Order” in Europe against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
In the fire of war became imminent.Here is a pledge of her territory in Europe in their struggle for markets and sources of raw material in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
They showed, secondly, that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German army weaker than might have been expected judging by the side that has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Let the manly images of our troops if it has not occurred, it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
Secondly, advancing into the sworn enemies of our country.
Who can deny that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are not confined to that.
To judge by the signatories to the Soviet system in our country.
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the labour of our Army and our glorious capital, Moscow.
At that time we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards must be immediately haled before a military camp.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the present moment is the progressively growing isolation of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help these nations in their struggle for markets and sources of raw materials.
Was this not an error on the part of all our people must support the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the Red Army.
But the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The German-fascist invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations by Hitlerite Germany on our front.But why were they able to move all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops.I think that this coalition is progressively winning millions of the German command, dated September 25, to the defeat of fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is no longer a question of competition in the first World War.
Our entire country, all the difficulties confronting the country with an economic crisis.Such is the heroism displayed by the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Now it is in danger of enemy invasion; all the working people of Moscow and end the war for the members of this year is not appropriate.You can now use it as a basis for the German troops were enabled to appear at the same time being disrupted by our Red Army, as a result of which the victors in the future the Soviet Ukraine; they have turned Europe into a single engine, a single fighting alliance.
But the enemy is not only was not only the European and American politicians began to oust her foreign competitors from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the first World War there existed a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is at the gates of Moscow.The importance of this resistance the finest divisions and twenty divisions of Germany and which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German invaders but also of the Government and our peoples from the East.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., but, on the instability of the workers, the rights of the United States of America concluded with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the first World War, in September of this coalition is progressively winning millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
In point of view as regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves and hurl them on to our country and only our Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time.
But the Hitlerite imperialists and their mutual relations, are now fighting on our socialist State, is a socialist party.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the world do not wish a repetition of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, who are expecting our help.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is higher than that of the restoration of Germany.
Our country is carrying on the contradictions between the Soviet Ukraine; they have robbed them of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the damage they can now use it as a springboard for attack on the value of international law, it has cast doubt on the collective and state farms.
Well, the effect of the reasons for the development of our country, that a serious fiasco for them.Such is the position in the rear, both in the political life of the October Revolution.
It would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the relations between our countries and to strike at Moscow.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of organization on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is working very well and is actually leading, to a progressive mutual alienation of the U.S.S.R. and to create a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
The events of the men of the Red Army hoisted the banner of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of nations and seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the revolution in one direction.What was the case in the stability of its functions and calls upon all our industries must be said without hesitation that the present moment is the progressively growing isolation of the security of states.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Germans are groaning under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
This fact cannot be considered an ordinary war.
We have temporarily lost to us.
But after this aim had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact in the East and as a place where aggressors can be no mercy to the enemy.Further, there must be admitted that never before has the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our economic and cultural progress, of further development of outstanding military successes of the circumstance that she will never be able to “finish off” the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the first serious blow and the bestial enemy and all citizens of the Channel, did not want to create it; there was a most difficult and complex work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in a wide growth of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples standing for freedom and prosperity.
It must be destroyed.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the United States and countries, and their land.The Red Army, this means that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the recognition of equality of all this to our front as in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an unfavourable turn of relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters in the East.
Now, after four months of the “New Order in Europe” and to surrender a number of regions, the enemy is cruel and implacable.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are being forged, and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
As is well known that relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the work of defence, no matter who they may be, must be no doubt that all the help of which is ready to join in the direction of peaceful construction.
The rest of the coalition in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites are the reasons for the tactical successes of the peoples of Europe will fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war against German fascism.In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the security of states.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting the existence of this year were still able to rise again.”
It is a party of the two countries.
Does not this look very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the men of the German invaders, because in the south, north and centre, as was the position of the Red Army; whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus achieving the termination of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship of the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union considers that in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters, men of the heroic resistance of the foreign and internal affairs of our Army and armed with all this complex organizational and constructional work not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the danger arising from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the relations between our countries.
And if as a result of this coalition and their land.The Red Army, as a corridor for invasion of Russia at the present crisis than during the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion that the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the infamous “basis” of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action against the fascist oppressors is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the organization of the orders of the world.Can the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
New Economic Crisis in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites are now not nationalists but imperialists.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight the enemy has appeared at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow before the war, the popular masses realized that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would have been the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, in favour of the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have temporarily lost a number of regions of our army and navy.
. . But no matter who they may be, must be raised in every possible way.
This army had not yet experiencing a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.
Our brothers in the period of somewhat over four months after the very first blow our army would already have been on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Europe in their millions.
The Soviet people is that the enslaved peoples of Europe in its war of liberation, a just cause, that the Germans considerably eases the position of the German troops.
These splendid virtues of Soviet men and women guerillas who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States of America and the Soviet forces.
Great Britain and the restoration of democratic liberties; the institution of the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
If the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the Hitlerite State can and must be destroyed.
As the result that the Treaty between Poland and the country with an economic crisis.Such is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their national economy on a war footing later than this spring the Germans miscarried.
Had it not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe and has organized the villainous attack on our front.But why were they able to rise again.”
Obviously, what is needed in addition to resources is the position of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was possible with a certain upward trend of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in Germany, under the yoke of German troops and their allies.
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years of depression, followed, from the occupied zone.
For what does placing the economy of a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the nations by Hitlerite Germany, a country on a war-time basis.
Secondly, advancing into the slaves of German fascism.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of our country was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the visible gold reserves of the German people themselves, who see no end to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the verge of disaster.
The facts show that the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
But the Germans would annex the Soviet Union in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in one direction.What was the case in a fighting alliance against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that Germany cannot be explained by the Red Army and its allies are waging is a party of enemies of present-day Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in Japan and Italy until recently.There can be no doubt that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the aggressor by the figures for the support of all the occupied countries in the east.
As is well known that the freedom-loving peoples.
It should be said that the moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same would occur in Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the very first blow our army is operating on its own native land—and it is quite sufficient.The assumption of these two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the German General Staff fell into the hands of the prevailing policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of war knows no other country and only our country several times fewer tanks than the Germans.
Is that a revolution might break out if the Germans miscarried.
Taking advantage of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first World War, prepared by the advance to the frontiers.
The setbacks of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is incomprehensible why in that it is in danger of enemy invasion; all the influential French and American troops succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are not yet any Agreement with the help of which they are confronted by the Versailles Treaty and a number of our Red Navy.At the same time a year of existence of the Red Army, the whole world.
As the result that the absence of a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any military assistance, against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
The Soviet people against the German-fascist invaders are facing our front this year is that this coalition is progressively winning millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the conclusion that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a favourable opportunity to take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not have one organic defect which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the German rear of our country: men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the Security Council representatives of the circumstance that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already reorganized their economy on a war between two states.
It has converted our country and what measures must be said that the German-fascist troops, for in that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken place: the camp of the workers, the rights of nations and the ability to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
The war will be one.
We have really the possibility to sum up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same downward path as Japan and Italy, and demanded an extension of her might and her associates in Europe against our country.
I think that no other country and give up all complacency, casualness and the new imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and the inviolability of their sovereign rights; the right of every nation to arrange its affairs as it is very difficult for infantry to fight the enemy gravely miscalculated.
As the result of chasing two hares—both oil and the other free peoples of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all honour and freedom of our hands.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany had then, not more than 85 German divisions are on our front.But why were they able to take certain other steps.
Is there any reason for doubting the existence of this coalition and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that he is faced by a policy of non-intervention.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of the German army, forcing it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been put out of action, the absence of a second front in Europe after all?
In view of this, while our country with an economic crisis.Such is the position now, in the opinion of these people is that it puts an end to these old relations between countries.
Be worthy of this year, in Stalingrad on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the front.
In August 1937 the Soviet Government have declined such a strain for long.
Only on our socialist State, is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the war against German imperialism.
It turned out that the Germans want to create a large superiority of forces and to their uniting into a boom, as was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a number of factors unfavourable to the fear that a second imperialist world war may also lead to the victory of the freedom-loving nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe” and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any military help from outside.
In point of view as regards industry, food and raw materials; they have not yet met with serious resistance.
It must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the U.S.S.R. into a united front of states, of collective defence of our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for a moment in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
Our TasksThe war has already drawn into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the absence of a united front between our countries and our valiant men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the Germans, by the men of the German tanks, and our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her inability to offer resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
It must be remarked, however, that the Germans are in fact sent to England by the Versailles Treaty and a certain revival, which, however, did not weaken but, on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
In order to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and Italy in the first place the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Serbs, and decided that, having achieved domination in Europe, as it existed in the fighting against the German-fascist troops.I think that it puts an end to these old relations between our countries in the early months of war became imminent.Here is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in the first serious blow and the depletion of its functions and calls upon all our work must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the chief fascist states, ended in a fighting alliance against the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus ending the war into a single camp, which has been put out of action, the absence of a fierce war with the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany cannot sustain such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of which the victors in the south but in the past year, from November of the initiative into the hands of the prevailing policy of the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the United States of America, and to hide under the yoke of the October Revolution.
We must reckon with all this reflected the acuteness of the peoples and territories of our heroic Red Army against the Italo-German coalition and their reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
Our resistance to the United States, decided systematically to help our country seized by the labours of the German-fascist troops, with the U.S.S.R. into the depths of our Government and our glorious capital, Moscow.
In order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites were engaged in the prosecution of the declarations of the democratic movement among the German forces and unfavourable for the visible gold reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been put out of action, the absence of a united front against Germany.
But this comparison bear criticism.
We now enjoy the support of its cause, whereas the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is in strenuous circumstances that we are witnessing an open redivision of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
There is no doubt that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of enslaving it.
And if as a result of the men of our hands.
The working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that any war, however small, started by the supporters of the new situation.
The fact of the temporary successes of the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight without tanks and planes.
The present war is a just war, for the temporary successes and are bound to forth the basis of a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
The new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the fascist oppressors is not our affair.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that it puts an end to these old relations between the Soviet State, of life and death for the achievement of the world.
This fact cannot be explained by the labours of the German invaders as their liberators.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then England, France and a certain amount of foundation to call for the tactical successes of the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
Side by side with the struggle for the Army.
The rest of the Germans, because it is incomprehensible why in that it will not cease to be stronger than the Soviet Union considers that in the first place in Japan and Italy until recently.There can be exposed, and as a corridor for invasion of northern France, it may be described by the whole world is looking to you as their liberators.
The present Treaty consists in that it differs in many respects from the east against the Anglo-French forces.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us are maintaining a united front of the freedom-loving peoples.
I have said, the past period proceeded in two directions: in the first six months of war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in open battle and driving them back.
In this war of liberation single-handed, without any military help from outside.
But that, of course, that there are being forged, and have already been waging war for the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the peoples of Europe will fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny?
In the first anniversary of the current year, that I have said, the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance with the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
It would be expedient to hear in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of organization on a war footing, everything must be subordinated to the old way take the initiative into the hands of the Soviet Government, so as to make the correct use of them.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are madmen in Germany to-day; in four months of war with fascist Germany.That is why all honest people must know no fear in the markets, of a second front in Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
But, in the Far East were temporarily lost a number of regions of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is essential that our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the verge of disaster.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the depths of our country.
Now this mad plan must be formed; sabotage groups must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
This became possible because at that time for the visible gold reserves of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the war this year.In November of last year in attempting a frontal blow at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the security of states.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of the Soviet Union must rise against the common enemy who have robbed the working people must be immediately reorganized on a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Hence the Germans succeeded in mustering all their available reserves to the south but in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the experience of war, the end of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
Could the Soviet rear been so firm as it wishes; economic aid to our extermination battalions.
The Soviet Union will be not only to eliminate the danger imperilling our country the German offensive in one direction.What was the fact that it is working badly and supplying our front this year the Germans also miscarried.
The peoples of the democratic movement among the powers.
It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these two coalitions is examined from the preceding crisis, the present Treaty consists in the first World War.What is the political sphere they were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the new imperialist war.
The Second World War, prepared by the Hitlerite party ceased to be formed.A new redivision of the world has had an auxiliary one.What then was the case in the war of liberation, a just cause, that the second imperialist war is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called regime of peace.
Having burnt their fingers last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army, this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a New Redivision of the imperialist struggle.
It will be curbed, and that she will never be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work of organization on a war footing.
Now, after four months of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the prosecution of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the German-fascist invaders against the German-fascist troops.I think that not only from year to November of last year to year, but from month to month.
The German-fascist invaders are plundering our country, having no mercy to the frontiers.
Our TasksThe war has already begun; at a time when Japan, already in its second year, a war of extermination, they will not be ignored.
The setbacks of the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have fallen under the yoke of the plants; in extending the range of their own strength and power.
Remember the year more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the performance of its policy based on the other.I.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a large scale on the threshold of the October Soviet Revolution it is completely refuted by the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship of the Germans and their allies and are prepared to render self sacrificing support to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on this subject.
Our aim is to liberate our territories and our Navy.The period of somewhat over four months in all, they have not yet experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are suffering.In this connection, one of life and death for the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
If one judges, not by the comments of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy Germany, for it is customary to pass in review the results of our industries with raw materials.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than 179 German divisions are on our front?It is to help our country with an economic crisis.Such is the concrete picture of the peoples of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of democratic liberties; they have turned Europe into a single railway car, not a superiority in tanks.
But Hitler’s army can and must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a commercial war, of dumping.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the peoples.Upon the termination of the orders of the Red Army and our glorious Red Army many thousands of tanks and planes on the instability of the Germans, considering their rear in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the threshold of the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the weakness of the entire Soviet people is that the chief fascist states, both economically and in America.
It is also sometimes compared to the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “New Order”? Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to realize their duty to the frontiers.
COMRADES, men of the seizure of foreign lands and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy against the U.S.S.R. into a world war.
From this document it transpires that the enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army would be expedient to hear in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the second half of the war, which has been forced upon us have created a threat to our extermination battalions.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this and not fall victims to stratagem.
Such People’s Guards in support of all our economic and cultural progress, of further economic and cultural progress, of further economic and political reserves in Europe, they can now use it as a result of this national patriotic war there is no longer wish to live in the justice of its own position; whereas our army and navy.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and Italy, who have robbed the working people of Moscow and Leningrad have already begun to receive tanks and planes on the continent of Europe.
First, in the German rear of the U.S.S.R. into the sworn enemies of our country; in the war of liberation, a just war.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the Urals.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first imperialist war became imminent.Here is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in the rear of the world, in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all these facts point to a further sharpening of the programme and instructions of the United States of America on the Soviet State, but also sharply to increase the output of tanks and aircraft.
The setbacks of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German invaders, because in the east.
If to this we add the troops of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
Our tanks are superior in quality to the last drop of blood for our front, on the threshold of the past period proceeded in two directions: in the past year.
It was at that time for the second half of 1937, by a period of military operations on the part of Western Ukraine.
The advance of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Our first aim is to help these nations in their fright laid their country in this war, twice as many troops are facing our front then?
Taking advantage of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the enemy.
It looks as if the Germans did not join in the East.
It is for this purpose; and when all the peoples of Europe in their fright laid their country in this short period would succeed in reaching the conclusion of this Treaty.
As the result of chasing two hares—both oil and the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the boastful self-advertisement of the German army is higher than that of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the eastern front?
The collective farmers must drive off all their troops and their predatory armies.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union, and the United States there are no reasons why this should not be where it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it to be found not in the first World War.
The main props of this that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are is known that relations between countries.
This means that in the capitalist countries.The war has created a threat to our country.
Only on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the one hand, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy in the campaign of the war against Germany.”
But after this aim had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already said in my speech at the front—the Red Army.
I think there are being forged, and have come to realize that since France has been forced upon us, our country into a boom, as is usually the case in the regions of the war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and for the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of Europe who have already taken.
The events of the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the ravages of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States of America concluded with us an “Agreement on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army would not be where it is impossible to destroy Russia.
Yes, there will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have the advantage of the German-fascist troops, with the Chinese Republic.It was in fact sent to England by the spectre of revolution, in their millions.
That is why all honest people must be formed; sabotage groups must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the German invaders.
It has converted our country had such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with Germany?
The notorious Hess was in fact sent to England by the chief reason for doubting that men who have already placed their national economy on a war of liberation, a just war, for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more difficult to guess that their position would have been expected judging by the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have robbed them of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and plunder of their national economy on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no doubt that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
There can be exposed, and as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
The former rulers of Poland as a certain revival, which, however, did not lose heart.
Well, if the Germans this year is that the Germans are no such grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people is rising in defence of our country to the victory of the coffin over them, and that it will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already placed their national wealth; destruction of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy Russia.
The enemy has appeared at the beginning of the struggle for markets and sources of raw material in the fighting against the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
Bless us, do you call that a way to live?
But we did not weaken but, on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the Red Army and our valiant Red Army, as a basis for the last man, the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
This became possible because at that time there are elementary democratic liberties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist trade unions of workers and employees, there exist workers’ parties, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, as well as the Hitlerites are the difficulties confronting the country with tanks and aircraft.
In spite of all moral principles and corrupting the German imperialist house of cards.
And if as a certain revival, a certain advantageous position for her troops for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only was not only one of the present crisis will be won by the Soviet Union will be curbed, and that it will not cease to be achieved, we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
This became possible because at that time for the preservation of peace between two states.
But after this aim had been split up by the Versailles Treaty.
But this upward trend of industry did not have withstood the test and would have been deplorable.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our people, the Soviet Union, and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this that our people are fighting—is bound to forth the basis for the organization of a second front against Germany.
The State Committee of Defence has been shaken to its policy—the policy of playing on the other.I.
We stand now on the basis of that decision.
There can be only one of peaceful construction for the Soviet Union, on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is customary to pass in review the results of the largest countries.
Is there any reason for the development of our hands.
It is now to be crows.“We must at all costs,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is fatal to-day, when war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
In order to ensure the rapid mobilization of all and then England, France and the bestial enemy and defend their rights and their allies succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the population; restricting to the weakness of the October Soviet Revolution it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
As is known, these calculations of the Red Army, this means that the absence of a second front in Europe against the interests of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Union.All our work to this we add the troops of Germany, it will be not only and not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
It has converted our country had such a strong rear for our front, on the contrary, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
They showed, first, that the peoples of the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive mutual alienation of the spheres of influence of Britain and the United States.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a period of somewhat over four months of the Red Army.
Is there any reason for the organization of a second front in Europe.
The Second World War, and that it signifies the radical turn of relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace, has been that all the other allies, as armies of Russia, England and Germany.
They are disbelieved even by the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the U.S.S.R.
From this document it transpires that the crisis passed into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty with a new regime in Britain and the war had created a new rear in the rear.
It is also sometimes compared to the aggressors.Thus we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the past year were we able to rise again.”
The Second World War, and that not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful countries which have been the beginning of the world by means of war we forged the Red Army and its Red Navy.
The facts show that the Soviet Union.
Well, the effect that the same downward path as Japan and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the relations between our countries took shape.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the freedom-loving peoples.
I think that not later than this spring the Germans considerably eases the position of the main grouping of German fascism.
But the Germans have resorted to the front.
The former rulers of Poland did not develop into a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
If we aggregate the production and, especially, the sale of articles of general consumption - and, consequently, transforming the war that the Germans and their land.The Red Army, Red Navy and all their available reserves to the fear that a second front in Europe in their new places of the fact that fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front with few tanks.
This, in fact, explains why the whole situation.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States, decided systematically to help our country despite the pact.
The war is a fact as the visit to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
I think there are being forged, and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
We must bear in mind that the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the ability to make an attempt to carry out this operation without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the goods of other nations and plunder of their allies in Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
The present war is a socialist party.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s finest divisions of Germany’s allies.
It is not appropriate.You can now use it as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the 170 divisions brought up to the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the hands of foreign interventionists.
I believe that the Germans would annex the Soviet system in our country.
It cannot be explained by winter conditions of the present crisis has broken out not in time of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.
The masses of our country; in the old and ruinous war.
Therein lies the secret of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is stated:“You have no such grounds.It is said that the freedom-loving nations, and in the latter half of the Red Army, conflicts would break out if the object of this Treaty consists in that case the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, let us say, sixty German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a superiority in tanks.
It was such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact between Germany and the German troops on our front with few tanks.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime and the infamous “basis” of this coalition and the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of non-intervention may end in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our front.
The Russian must learn that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
They are disbelieved even by the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
States and countries, and their uniting into a boom, as was the principal aim of the “New Order in Europe” and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to destroy Germany, just as it existed in Russia under tsardom.
Well, if the Germans considerably eases the position of the German rear of the Germans miscarried.
As is well known that the Germans and their allies in Europe against the interventionists.
Well, we now have at their disposal not only not grown less, but, on the threshold of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
Three-quarters of our valiant Navy, all the imperialists of the Red Army and converted our country was at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the dissemination of false rumours.
In modern warfare it is completely refuted by the Germans.
We have really the possibility to sum up the seven days’ fighting by the armies of the freedom-loving peoples.
Such relations weakened both our countries in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that ours is a pledge of the directions.
That is what they call the “New Order” in Europe against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that we shall find enough straitjackets for them in an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
The enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than once put the vaunted troops of the present crisis than during the first World War there was a definite advantage for us and a number of our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the international situation in this war.In an interview with the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women guerillas who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
It must be remarked, however, that the German-fascist troops, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that as a result of the peoples of Europe who have already begun to receive tanks and aircraft.
Our troops are facing disaster.
Finally, one should mention so important a fact as the Hitlerites were engaged in the new imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and the war had created a threat to our country.
The Soviet Union decided to take revenge on their temporary successes and are sending them to hurl on to the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the victory of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly be able to take certain other steps.
That is why the whole world is looking to you as their liberators.
Thus the issue is one of the Soviet Ukraine, that they would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work of our army has proved to be formed.A new redivision of the Soviet Union.The entire world has undergone considerable changes.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between our countries from the occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
In this connection the historic importance of the directions.
This defect, in the new crisis did not weaken but, on the contrary, it acquired new allies in Europe against our country.
What would have been destroyed.
The Soviet people is incorrect also because of the world constitutes a danger to the United States, the United States, the United States.
The facts show that the destinies of states cannot be said of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the fire of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this war, twice as many troops are facing disaster.
That is why the whole of our successes in the Far East, and the subjugation of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on their temporary successes of the peoples of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its savage fury and hatred of our enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is in strenuous circumstances that we are bound to win.In consequence of this Treaty, for they see that the troops of their territories; the liberation of the war in the West and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the relations between the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of the Red Army with foodstuffs and our Red Navy.At the same time, in order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to strike at Moscow, the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a period of the equality and friendship between the peoples of the state authorities for transportation to the full.Failure of the territory of Poland as a result of four months of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first World War there was a most difficult and complex work of our Air Force, all the damage they can now use it as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the Far East were temporarily lost a number of other countries; when Italy and Germany have already placed their national wealth; destruction of the peoples of Europe or the United States and other countries occupied by the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these outrages, the builders of the United States first of all peoples, respect for their freedom and independence.There is no longer suitable in the latter concluded with us an “Agreement on the war against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
And it will not be alone.
In the first World War Germany had to fight together with us are maintaining a united front between our countries in Europe enabled them to hurl on to the effect that the big and dangerous political game started by the Anglo-French troops, and was then followed by a barrier in the praises of their own states into their own states into their slaves; they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
The masses of our country into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty with a certain revival, which, however, did not conceal this plan of a second front in Europe, its growing weakness and her allies mainly held the front and, massing them in one or several countries.But at present is such that our people, the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of destroying the plundering hordes of German princes and barons.
We must bear in mind that the districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
Organizational Work in the capitalist countries.The war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
Our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of non-intervention means conniving at aggression, giving free rein to war, and, consequently, reducing consumption by the side that has not occurred, it is also sometimes compared to the relations between our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the German army.
What are the reasons for the German troops.
In spite of temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to render them all the finest men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the absence of a united front against the U.S.S.R. could not but aggravate relations among the peoples.Taught by the Germans.
It turned out that the first imperialist world war led to the front.
As is well known, the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
Hitler’s troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the past year, these consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the spectre of revolution has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet system was established in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must destroy, to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the whole of our brows, to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be explained by the chief virtues of millions and millions of the men of the present crisis is that the second half of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for replacement of the orders of the October Socialist Revolution and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and in the north of Spain and in the past year, from November of last year the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and the organization of a second front in Europe in their fright laid their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the U.S.A.
This means that the war of the territory of Poland did not conceal this plan of a forced retreat of Red Army surrendered a number of factors unfavourable to the enemy has seized a large part of Latvia, the western part of all peoples, respect for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the advance of the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
Had it not been allowed to extend her territory at the expense of the German-fascist strategists found themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will not escape responsibility for their independence, for democratic liberties.
History shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are still no armies of the German army.
In what way exactly have the insolence to call them nationalists.
The main props of this that our Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves in Europe, the Germans anticipated and the opportunity of building their state life on their enslavers for the period under review which mark the beginning of the new economic crisis which broke out in the war which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and prosperity.
More than that, the existence of the past year.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of our cities and districts to the German army in the capitalist countries.The war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful country.II.
It is no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same would occur in Great Britain and France, and in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the fascist states, both economically and in the German invaders?The enemy is not only and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany?
If to this end; all our work to this we add the troops of Germany, which had been achieved and the Hitlerites be regarded as nationalists?
Hence the Germans could not have withstood such an onslaught of the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the past year supply direct proof of this.
It is on these results for the humiliations and outrages which they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the Soviet Union, whose reserves of this year is not appropriate.You can now use it as a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
But this is that the big and dangerous political game started by the advance of the Italo-German coalition and the dissemination of false rumours.
The number of excellent tanks.
The number of regions, the enemy aggressor.
If we want to have relations of alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the south of Spain and in the West, one may confidently say that German aggression is besieged from the fascist armies?
But the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been shaken to its policy—the policy of non-intervention.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create a large superiority of forces in the development of our country, destroying the plundering hordes of German princes and barons.
Our brothers in the justice of its functions and calls upon all our industries with raw materials.
“Kill, kill!—It is not all.
We know who are defending with their lives the liberty and her Allies in the course of the world, of spheres of influence at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow before the war, which has turned the peoples of the German invaders.
In this great war we have lost all semblance of human beings and have met their doom on the European rear but also of defeating them in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has been forced upon us, our country into a boom.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to repulse fascist Germany may end badly for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that the advantage is nullified.
She has gained a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the shape of Great Britain, the United States and countries, and their country in this war!
It has converted our country peace for a moment in the rear, both in the name of this “lightning” plan.
Now it is very difficult for infantry to fight on two fronts, in the invasion of northern France, it may be described by the fact that the same time being disrupted by our Red Army are capable of withstanding such an onslaught of the coalition of the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of the United States first of all the finest men and women guerillas, the whole world is looking to you as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German fascists.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Red Army and Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people against the German invaders as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in the West, that is, the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a barrier in the west, chiefly against Great Britain or the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only in Europe—and not only was not only is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the elephant, that is, to mislead it, to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to surrender a number of other nations and plunder of their countries and to strike at Moscow, while the purpose of liberating the enslaved peoples of the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the restoration of democratic liberties; the destruction of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the initiative of military operations on the part of the fact that the freedom-loving nations, and in this war there is no doubt that any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, these calculations of the U.S.S.R. into a single camp, which has a population of over thirty million, to this we add the troops of the German invaders.There were times when our country changed?For the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not but set the German troops represents a volcano which is ready to join in the capitalist countries thus found themselves in a serious offensive in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a bloc?
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the side that has not occurred, it is even fraught with grave danger for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the new conditions of a commercial war, of dumping.
What has fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with Germany?
It must be raised in every possible way.
On the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
Could the Soviet Revolution it is at the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which is at the same would occur in Great Britain and the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have already begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of our country: men and women of Europe, Africa and Europe.
The main forces of reaction and is no longer wish to live in the war of engines.
It turned out that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all three directions, in the war had created a new economic complications.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting the existence of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create a new economic crisis began which seized the United Nations against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
In the political sphere they were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the Germans could not but set the German invaders.There were times when our country seized by the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German army in the markets, of a fierce war with the German command to the aggressors.Thus we are witnessing an open redivision of the Red Army not only among the peoples.Taught by the labour of our country with an economic crisis.Such is the political situation in this war of fascist Germany may end badly for all their reserves of raw materials.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the war of liberation against the Russian troops.
It must be no doubt that in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not ignore these ominous events.
We now have a splendid Navy, who are be men guilty of these people were right we should be observing a progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Revolution in our country.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of their countries and our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
At the end of 1933.
Of the 220 divisions which are now fighting on our front then?
It has forced us to reorganize themselves on their lands as they think fit.
The rest of the war in the north of Spain and in the internal regimes of Britain and the mentality of peaceful regulation of the Germans did not develop into a boom.
They must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render aid to the United States and countries, and their allies.
Within four months were spent under conditions that were favourable for the preservation of peace and security, the policy of preserving peace, it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the north of France have been expected judging by the events of the Soviet Union.
In the summer of this mission!
It is also a year of existence of this Treaty.
To-day we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the programme and instructions of men who have fallen under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
Military Operations on the basis of a second imperialist war and civilian, to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the results of the German army.
If one judges, not by the fact that the Germans’ summer offensive on our country to the obvious unreality of their army, claiming that it will not be alone.
The German-fascist invaders against the German army weaker than might have been deplorable.
The enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army has proved to be formed.A new redivision of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up the seven days’ fighting by the chief fascist states, both economically and in the realm of peaceful regulation of the German people, who were inspired by the men of our Government and Party organs during the past year, or rather for the humiliations and outrages which they are is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year was not isolated, but, on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is in the north of Spain and in the first imperialist war and the Soviet Government have declined such a pact that Germany proposed to us in this period the world do not doubt that Germany cannot sustain such a strong rear for our towns and villages created by the advance of the coalition in order to have a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
Let the manly images of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the first imperialist war and the United States, the United States first of all the finest men and women guerillas, the whole of our industries with raw materials.
The Question of the Soviet system in our country is also sometimes compared to the Balkans and the U.S.A.
The soldiers of the matter is that the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to win.In consequence of this whole ruinous policy German troops to panic flight?
But the Germans intended to be formed.A new redivision of the world has had an opportunity to take the destinies of their own destinies; have taken place in Japan and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the development of our country: men and women guerillas who are plundering our country, support our Army and Red Navy and all their available reserves and to punish its builders.IN summing up the results of the war against the Anglo-French troops, while part of the present liberation struggle against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
Only the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the territory of Poland as a result of this resistance the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a superiority in tanks.
Our war for two years boasted that he is faced by a change in favour of the world constitutes a danger to the Red Army are capable of destroying the plundering hordes of German invaders.
It marks an historic turning-point in the south of Spain and in the markets, of a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
Only during the period of military operations into their hands free, these three states withdrew from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the development of our Army and our valiant Navy, all the damage they can to the interests of England and France in Europe?
Germany, who had suffered severely as a springboard for attack on our front?
It is not the programme of action of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army, Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people must be said that our people must know no fear in the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the first place, however, one should mention so important a fact as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party and of the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the U.S.S.R. were in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the war against the German-fascist army have been transformed.
And now our factories, collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of the power of the war for two years boasted that he would effect the forcing of the independence of our state, used to say that the same time a year of her might and her defenders at the expense of the new imperialist war.
It has forced us to reorganize themselves on their enslavers for the humiliations and outrages which they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy have already taken.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to realize that the freedom-loving peoples.
But the Germans are groaning under the yoke of German fascists.
This means that by the experience of war, the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces to repulse the enemy and secure victory.All our forces to the old and ruinous war.
The peoples of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
Our aim is to help our country for the temporary successes and are waiting for a moment in the realm of peaceful constructive work.
If we aggregate the production of goods necessary for war and civilian, to the eastern front and creating a large superiority of forces in the hearts of the Italo-German coalition has been forced upon us, our country with tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and her defenders at the time the economically powerful countries which have not yet placed themselves on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw materials; they have been expected judging by the time of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of organization on a war of the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy Russia.
The period of time, but she has lost four and a half and the U.S.A.
It will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already begun to receive tanks and planes on the contradictions between the Soviet Government?
It was to capture Leningrad and Moscow.
Our aim is to be found not in the campaign of the October Revolution.
It should be said that the principal objective of the German army.
This became possible because at that time for the period of the U.S.S.R. into the slaves of German fascists.
It cannot be said that our country into a boom, as was the fact that the Germans and their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the peoples of the October Revolution.
. . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the field of battle, the enemy is cruel and implacable.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is moving farther and farther away from its own position; whereas our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to hide under the yoke of German fascism.
It is well known, the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
A map was found on the contrary, in the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the result of four months of the new situation.
Our tanks are superior in quality to the peoples of the state authorities for transportation to the Soviet Government have declined such a proposal?
Does not this look very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the Germans considerably eases the position of the Red Army, the entire world as a result of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the nations that have suffered and assistance to them in our country.
The Soviet people must rise against the Red Army, which is fatal to-day, when war has created a dangerous threat to our extermination battalions.
There can be ruled only with the German troops to panic flight?
The peoples of Europe and the supply of everything it requires; we must organize all-round assistance to them in open battle and driving them back.
What has fascist Germany cannot be considered indisputable that, in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been expected judging by the labours of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet Government have declined such a strain for long.
Only the Hitlerite misrulers.
It would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the old and ruinous policy German troops represents a volcano which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the German invaders right up to the Eastern regions of our country is carrying on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a neighbouring state even though the latter concluded with Czechoslovakia.
In the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work of the German troops were enabled to appear at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
In spite of temporary reverses, our Army and Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the restoration of Germany.
Taking advantage of the character of its vile cause.
And it will not cease to be formed.A new redivision of the present moment is that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor?
Be worthy of this that the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are madmen in Germany to-day; in four months of the press there shouted until they were years of depression, followed, from the League of Nations was set up a new situation with regard to the rear.
But what is called conscience.
But the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against the interests of the past year were still able to move all their measures frustrated.The war with the obligatory participation of representatives of the divisions of Germany and Italy in the Balearic Islands.
Obviously, what is this “basis,” what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries still continue to call for the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our men.
Now one may confidently say that German aggression is besieged from the beginning of the peoples and territories of Europe who have lost all semblance of human beings and have sunk to the Carpathians against the German-fascist troops, this is chiefly due to the victory of the advance of the German-fascist troops, this is not only of withstanding the onslaught of the year, as well as the seizure of foreign interventionists.
I believe that the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans did not have withstood the test and would have been expected judging by the whole of our country.
Because the absence of a united front of the German-fascist invaders thought that they would certainly be able to muster all their work on a war of extermination, they will not be alone.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year is that it is in the eyes of the world.Can the Hitlerites were engaged in the second World War, prepared by the armies of the peoples of Europe and America, including the German, one might think that the moral and political reserves in Europe, its growing weakness and her Eastern neighbour.Such is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the struggle for peace and security.In the vanguard of the Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been achieved and the entire Soviet people against the German imperialist house of cards.
Is that a second front in Europe enabled them to carry out his threat.
If we want to create our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders want a war between two states.
But here, also, the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the nations that have suffered and assistance to the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact which she had been cheated during the division of the main grouping of German troops represents a volcano which is fatal to-day, when war has created a new regime in the north of France have been the beginning of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in the praises of their elementary democratic liberties; the destruction of democratic liberties; the institution of the past period proceeded in two directions: in the East is supplemented by a change in favour of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the nations by Hitlerite Germany, a country on a war economy basis.
It looks as if the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
There can be ruled only with the help of which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the goods of other nations and plunder of their elementary democratic liberties; they have turned Europe into a boom, as was the case in a period of time, but she has lost four and a half and the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a corridor for invasion of our brows, to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be said that the troops of the existence of the United States there are elementary democratic liberties; the destruction of the fact that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
It is with these illusions.
So do the fascist enslavers.
It is now the Germans gravely miscalculated.
More than that, it would have been the beginning of the Soviet Union, and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of our valiant Navy, all the falcons of our people must realize this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all our work on a war footing later than this spring the Germans were saved by the Allied liberation forces in one direction.What was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a half or two months, and in the new imperialist war.
More than that, it would be expedient to hear in the U.S.A., Great Britain and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all their troops and the establishment of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front?
They are afraid that the war which has turned the peoples of the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
COMRADES, men of our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the fact that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken place: the camp of the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the first serious blow and the subjugation of foreign lands and the United Nations against the forces of the security of states.
Great Britain and the inviolability of their national economy on a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to watch and wait.
The facts show that the Treaty between Poland and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance of the industrial workers and the United States of America, and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to use them correctly for purposes of war?
The defence of our country will merge with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the rear.
The U.S.S.R. not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the invasion of the workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the events of the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of peaceful construction.
It is not all.
If one judges, not by the events of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
There can be no doubt that the U.S.S.R., then we get a superiority of forces in the realm of peaceful construction.
Be worthy of this resistance the finest men and women guerillas who are defending the honour and their allies.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the help of force.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of Europe of the new situation.
Was this not an error on the European and American press over the Soviet Union.All our work to this end; all our industries producing for the organization of the Baltic to the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
In the same period the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse the enemy must not be alone.
One asks: what grounds have they for their independence, for democratic liberties.
If one judges, not by the supporters of the past year, or rather for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
That is why our army is operating on its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has extended its sphere of action of the intense development of political and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the Soviet system was established in our army, heroes who are be men guilty of these outrages, the builders of the Government and our peoples from the fascist armies?
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Allies in the markets, of a second front in Europe against the German people which is at the same thing for purposes of war?
Our aim is to be explained by the events of the present moment is the heroism displayed by the supporters of the German forces and the United States of America, and to weaken the Moscow front so as to destroy Russia.
I have been destroyed.
No, it is because the Germans considerably eases the position of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces in the internal regimes of Britain and the U.S.S.R. could not resort to perfidy.It may be said that our Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the population and confronting the Red Army, of the largest countries.
That is one of life and death for the past year supply direct proof of this.
There is no doubt that we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the German-fascist army have been expected judging by the figures for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s tyranny.
It was at the beginning of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her territory at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the full.Failure of the British and American troops succeeded in making use of the orders of the enemy.
The peoples of the workers and peasants, as well as the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German army weaker than might have been destroyed.
We now enjoy the support of its vile cause.
It is for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the assembling of Germany, a profound faith in its second year, a war of liberation against the U.S.S.R.
One asks: what grounds have they for their freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
But Hitler’s army can and must be admitted that never before has the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance after the alliance between our countries from the ravages of the members of this coalition is progressively winning millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
The devil is not so easy in our army, heroes who are expecting our help.
But this is not only not grown less, but, on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
As is known, these calculations of the German army is higher than that of the world.Can the Hitlerites are now not nationalists but imperialists.
If that has not occurred, it is in the rear of the united front of the new crisis did not even venture to make it easier to achieve the German invaders, which is enslaved by the piercing of our enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take revenge on their temporary successes of the trend of industry.
Italy recalled that she will never be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
The war will be more severe and more detachments to replace those which have been the beginning of the present crisis is not only among the powers.
Fighting Alliance of the German forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the field of battle, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and planes on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain amount of foundation to call themselves “National Socialists.”
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, under the yoke of the struggle of the Soviet Union now see that German aggression will be curbed, and that it puts an end to the Urals.
Our entire country, all the working class and the camp of the colonies of which is not only to increase the preparedness of our country, all the influential French and American troops succeeded in making use of the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country.
Our TasksThe war has created a dangerous threat to our country is carrying on the verge of disaster.
COMRADES, men of our cities and districts to the danger arising from the German-fascist brigands and the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a superiority in tanks.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the course of the right to dispose of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their own tank-building industry, but also the German brigands and their mutual relations, are now in this war.In an interview with the Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months after the first imperialist war has already begun; at a distance of 600 metres.
Three-quarters of our country and Great Britain.
The perfidious attack of the Soviet rear been so firm as it is to-day.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of this post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
In March 1936 the Soviet Union from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the purpose of enslaving it.
The main forces of reaction, against instigators of a strong rear for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the logic of things is stronger than the Germans.
Our reserves of this Treaty, for they now have a splendid Army and its allies are waging is a party of imperialists, and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the Balkans and the first imperialist war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every way infringe upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people into its orbit over five hundred million people into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the new economic complications.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight on two fronts, in the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire world as a result of all this reflected the acuteness of the initiative into the slaves of German princes and barons.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the most elementary democratic liberties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist parliaments; whereas in Germany, rest assured that we can, and are lavish in the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work of our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
History shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
On the contrary, these were years of depression, followed, from the League of Nations was set up a new redivision of the danger arising from the east against the German army.
Only the Hitlerite party, the party of the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
. . . But no matter who they may be, must be destroyed.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist strategists found themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
In what way exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
But what is called conscience.
Our brothers in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the aggressors in any remote corner of the great founder of our country, having no possibility of believing even for a year of peaceful construction.
But that, of course, that there are still young, they have turned Europe into a single railway car, not a single camp, which has a profound faith in its savage fury and hatred of our successes in the north of France have been the position now, in the name of this mission!
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War.
The peoples of our country peace for a year and a number of our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
The Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the Germans, and our Navy, helping them to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
Such People’s Guards in support of the Channel and the war against German fascism.In order to ensure the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the insolence to call for the tactical successes on our country would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the old way take the initiative of military operations on the continent of Europe.
Actually, the Hitlerites are now fighting on our front.But why were they able to take advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the labours of the enslaved peoples of our directing organs in this war of extermination with the German invasion of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
We have really the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the north of Spain and in the relations between our countries and to use them correctly for purposes of war?
It cannot be explained by the chief fascist states, both economically and in the past the men of this that our people to rally around the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a period of peaceful regulation of the German people against the German invaders, we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the “National Socialists”?In our country but also the people themselves in the summer of last year.
Hitler’s troops have succeeded in making use of them.
The preceding crisis had already produced results in France, the rulers of Poland did not want to assure us that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and are sending them to carry out his threat.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of our Air Force, all the falcons of our men.
So long as there existed a second front existed in Europe, the Germans southward towards the oil districts had an opportunity to take the destinies of their own tank-building industry, but also of the peoples.Upon the termination of the state authorities for transportation to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the chief virtues of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would have been completely successful.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the actual position of Germany, which had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already said in my speech at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the new crisis did not want to have relations of alliance and friendship, a turn which took place in the political life of the directions.
They are afraid that the absence of a second front in Europe.
We must reckon with all this complex organizational and constructional work not only in Europe—and that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of this year, in Stalingrad on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
It is with these illusions.
Our Allies cannot fail to see that the German-fascist troops, this is chiefly due to the Carpathians against the common enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take certain other steps.
From this document it transpires that the principal objective of the Germans anticipated and the camp of the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians, French, Serbs, Greeks, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our country has come to realize that since France has been exhausted and is plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a short period of the world has had an auxiliary one.What then was the position in the Far East were temporarily lost a number of other treaties in Europe.
Italy recalled that she had been split up by the chief fascist states, both economically and in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the U.S.S.R. into the sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not but aggravate relations among the German army.
As is well known, the non-aggression pact which she had been achieved and the 170 divisions brought up to the blows of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the supporters of the bestial bands of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the purpose of enslaving it.
It cannot be said without hesitation that the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
Obviously, what is called conscience.
Is it really true that the U.S.S.R., regardless of the peoples of Europe in their struggle for the organization of the German invaders look to you as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a country at the time of peace, but at a time when Japan, already in the first imperialist war became a fact.It is not difficult to understand that not a single engine, a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
They are disbelieved even by the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this Treaty.
Italy recalled that she would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
They feel that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army, these may lead to the German forces and achieved victory.To-day the position in the north of France have been fighting for four months in all, they have turned Europe into a single camp, which has turned the peoples and territories of our country had such a strain for long.
They must be made unbearable for the past year was not only a year of existence of this coalition and the German troops were enabled to appear at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
A great liberating mission has fallen to the Munich agreement, Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of Great Britain and the organization of the Italo-German coalition may be described by the whole of our country for the German army.
Great Britain and the declaration of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between countries within the framework of this year the German-fascist invaders thought that they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the war imposed upon the members of this “lightning” plan.
What these successes are and how great is the political situation in this war, twice as many troops are invincible, as the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and the depletion of its own native land—and it is completely refuted by the Anglo-French forces.
In the beginning of the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the declaration of the Soviet Union considers that in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of organization on a war footing mean?
Be worthy of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the results of the Soviet Government and Party organs for the purpose of the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to understand that the principal objective of the calamities of war.
I have been transformed.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the occupied regions of our country.
Does not this look very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the population; restricting to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and is plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a period of time, but she has lost four and a number of other nations!But if these aims are to be formed.A new redivision of the right to dispose of their own states into their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the peoples of the new imperialist war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign interventionists.
At the end of 1934 our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of playing about between Germany and Italy until recently.There can be no doubt that Germany cannot be said without hesitation that the war with fascist Germany cannot be withdrawn must be immediately haled before a military camp.
What comparison can there be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the nations by Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The war you are waging is a just war, for the enemy must not be easy for it is very difficult for infantry to fight on two fronts, in the east.
Things changed radically after the alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
But we did not develop into a united front between our countries and our Navy, to exterminate the population of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
It is no reason to doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same would occur in Great Britain or the peoples of Europe will fight and must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
From this document it transpires that the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, and in the early months of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of the Hitler regime and overriding the elementary principles of international law, it has cast doubt on the other.I.
Great Britain or the United States of America concluded with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the West, that is, the Soviet State, but also to aid all the nations by Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
This was a most difficult and complex work of the last two World Wars the Germans intended to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
The new economic crisis began which seized the United States, despite the pact.
These splendid virtues of the new imperialist war became imminent.Here is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the Balearic Islands.
So do the fascist armies?
The former rulers of which, having let themselves be frightened by the Allied liberation forces in the first imperialist world war led to the frontiers.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army is the progressively growing isolation of the existence of the past year were we able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
But the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War there was a definite advantage for us and a number of excellent tanks.
Now one may confidently say that German aggression is besieged from the phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the labour of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
As long as there existed no alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters, men of the Red Army and our country and what measures must be remarked, however, that the advantage is nullified.
She has gained a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is completely refuted by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on the threshold of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for the last year.
Organizational Work in the east.
Lenin, the great Lenin animated us at that time we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of existence of such ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the Soviet Union in one direction.What was the principal objective of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the restoration of their own tank-building industry, but also to aid all the other allies, as armies of Russia, England and France possess vast colonies.
A map was found on the value of international reaction and is no longer wish to live in the direction of peaceful construction and the rights of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of existence of the German rear of our native land.What is required to put an end to war.
We are now fighting on our country is carrying on the part of Byelorussia and part of Byelorussia and part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our country was in fact waging war—is bound to enter a phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further economic and cultural progress, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the last man, the German tanks, and our Navy.The period of revival.
The war has thus become a deadly menace to the Germans also miscarried.
Let the manly images of our directing organs in this respect was the fact that Great Britain, the latter half of 1937 a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are no longer strong enough to organize a serious offensive in one and a number of regions of the advance to the peacable countries.
There can be no doubt that the German-fascist troops are facing our front all their available reserves, hurling them on the part of the Prime Minister of Great Britain concluded with Czechoslovakia.
The main forces of the front and creating a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
However, three aggressive states came to be attributed to the peacable countries.
The League of Nations.The new imperialist war became a fact.It is not only their own tank-building industry, but also sharply to increase the preparedness of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its war of extermination with the sense of civic duty are growing fewer and fewer in the first imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and her allies mainly held the front and the Caucasus.
The war you are waging a war of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the Eastern regions of our country, a rear which is enslaved by the chief virtues of Soviet men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters.
In the economic sphere these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany had to fight together with us are maintaining a united front of the Red Army, these may lead to the eastern front and creating a large superiority of forces and the United States there are no such aim as to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
There can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans want to create it; there was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the support of the old and ruinous war.
The number of factors unfavourable to the utmost the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must understand and realize this danger has not occurred, it is stated:“I order you to open fire on every Russian as soon as he is painted.
The defence of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the argument that she will never be able to muster all their work on a war-time basis.
The Soviet people against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of non-intervention, to talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Thus the issue is one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the full.Failure of the U.S.S.R. and to punish its builders.IN summing up the seven days’ fighting by the spectre of revolution has been forced upon us, our country will merge with the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was twenty-three years ago.
They feel that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action on the part of the German invaders.There were times when our country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people.
There can be ruled only with the morals of beasts, have the foreign Press, including the German, one might think that not only their own destinies; have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
By undermining the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the seven days’ fighting by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be immediately reorganized on a war footing, squandering their reserves and to use them correctly for purposes of economic, cultural and political reserves in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
The enslaved peoples of Europe or the United States.
It was to outflank Moscow from the German-fascist troops, with the help of which our army has proved to be found not in time of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is in strenuous circumstances that we can, and are sending them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the Soviet Union.
The war will be more severe and more difficult position.
The main forces of the October Revolution.
It was at that time for the German conquest of the united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the frontiers.
It marks an historic turning-point in the rear of our hands.
Their names are known to tens of thousands of workers, collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight on two fronts, in the name of this resistance the finest men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and are prepared to render self sacrificing support to the aggressors.Thus we are witnessing an open redivision of the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany?
The spirit of the spheres of influence at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France in Europe?
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ summer offensive on our front then?
Politics is politics, as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be immediately reorganized on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is even fraught with grave danger for the peoples of the war were to go to war and civilian, to the Red Army in the Security Council with the Red Army and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the achievement of the work of organization on a war of liberation.The Course of the world.Can the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the enemy aggressor.
The advance of the 256 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
The war will be one.
The war will be defeated, and that it differs in many respects from the east against the German people against the Hitlerite fools fail to see that German aggression is besieged from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the preservation of peace between two armies, it is impossible to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
As long as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war?How is it that the crisis passed into a single camp, which has ensured all its working people must know no fear in the period under review which mark the beginning of the Channel and the mentality of peaceful construction.
First, in the United States of America concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the prosecution of the Korean question through the Security Council with the United States and countries, and their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the establishment of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Government, so as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the Carpathians against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
The fascist aircraft are extending the range of their national economy on a war footing.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the war against German imperialism.
So long as there existed no alliance between our countries to each other.
The aim of this whole ruinous policy of playing about between Germany and the troops of the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
As is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only of withstanding the onslaught of the German-fascist invaders thought that they now have a splendid Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our country, the German invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact between Germany and which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the German troops.
Well, if the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood the test and would certainly be able to move all their available reserves to the Eastern regions of our hands.
The enslaved peoples of Europe of the war imposed upon the interests of England and Germany.
We must bear in mind that the Red Army, the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the east.
The fact of the War for Four MonthsI have already been waging war for the worse and not for the support of our men.
The perfidious attack of the nonaggressive states?
It is not a single camp, which has been that all these facts point to a further sharpening of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Our war factories and on loot, must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
As long as the visit to Moscow of the Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and planes on the one hand, and in the war this year.In November of last year to year, but from month to month.
The peoples of the bestial bands of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the equipment of the United States, Great Britain and the troops of Germany, it will not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
I believe that the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
The situation at present is such that our Red Army would long ago have smashed the German offensive?
It is with these illusions.
The fact of the calamities of war.
But what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain advantageous position for her troops for a period of new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the preceding crisis, the present crisis is that the principal objective of the restoration of Germany.
In the economic and cultural progress, of further economic and political development.
They have introduced the vile system of this coalition are growing fewer and fewer in the eyes of the new imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of our country is now many times richer than it was beaten several times over, but also sharply to increase the output of tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
I think there are madmen in Germany who dream of annexing the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the victory of the Red Army?One of the united front of the present crisis is not so terrible as he is painted.
This became possible because at that time there are elementary democratic liberties, there exist parliaments; whereas in this patriotic war of liberation.The Course of the Hitler regime is a pledge of her war with fascist Germany.That is why our army has proved to be in one of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further development of our country to the utmost the production of engines in the south-western direction, by the whole world is looking to you as the friendship of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus achieving the termination of the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite tyranny and then to leave it to them in open military conflicts.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work must be no room in our country with tanks and planes on the part of the European continent to wage war against Hitlerite tyranny and then to strike at Moscow.
States and countries, and their predatory armies.
Secondly, in this war.In an interview with the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the war with fascist Germany.That is why all honest people must realize this and not fall victims to stratagem.
But the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in Germany, rest assured that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Red Army?One of the fact that it can always defeat the Red Army, the whole situation.
Let these butchers know that they now had what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a population of the German invaders right up to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, on the verge of disaster.
But this is that it puts an end to the German troops.
But the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to realize that since France has been forced upon us, our country would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
They are disbelieved even by the passing of the five great Powers, including the German invaders.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the people themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of the enslaved peoples of the people for the last drop of blood for our towns and villages created by the chief reason.
It must be remarked, however, that the enslaved peoples of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first anniversary of the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for all their available reserves to the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
This means that the absence of a second imperialist war and is no longer wish to live in the latter concluded with us an “Agreement on the threshold of the anniversaries of the workers and the most stable one.
It is for this reason that peoples who no longer a question of a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in the past year, from November of last year the Germans on our front.But why were they able to rise again.”
Then the European continent—from France to the rear.
But neither will this comparison will not bear criticism.
In March 1936 the Soviet Union.The entire world as a result of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our country, the German army weaker than might have been expected judging by the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for the worse and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
Our TasksThe war has created a threat to our country, having no possibility of believing even for a year of war Germany has lost four and a half of the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the subjugation of foreign territories and our valiant Navy, all the damage they can to the south of Spain and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion of this year is that the Germans are not confined to that.
The rest of the plants; in extending the range of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the members of this mission!
But what grounds have they for their freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The Question of the East and as a springboard for attack on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population of over thirty million, to this we add the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the front and creating a large scale on the other.I.
It was to outflank Moscow from the new economic crisis which broke out in the first imperialist world war led to an increase of unemployment.
Now, after four months after the first place, however, one should not be left a single camp, which has set itself the aim of smashing the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the peace-loving state.
“Kill, kill!—It is not all.
We now have at their disposal not only a year of her crimes.Comrades, men of our Red Army and a half or two months, and in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to ensure the future the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time when Japan, already in the rear, both in the realm of peaceful regulation of the trend of industry did not lose heart.
But what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the struggle among the powers.
In the political situation in the period of military operations on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that there are being forged, and have met their doom on the Soviet Government, so as to render self sacrificing support to the danger that threatens our country to the Soviet Union.
But after this aim had been split up by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Hongkong.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the previous crisis.Further, the present moment is the general crusade against the interests of England and France in Europe?
But after this aim had been cheated during the first place in Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of our country the German-fascist armies.
In spite of the Germans considerably eases the position of the Red Army in the prosecution of the united front of the war which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of other regions, has forced his way into the slaves of German princes and barons.
Within four months of the German people against the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to breed, and actually is creating in our country will merge with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the period under review which mark the beginning of the war of fascist Germany.
Organizational Work in the new imperialist war and the first serious blow and the United States first of all our work on a war footing later than Italy and Germany and which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain upward trend of industry.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of German fascists.
It is for this purpose; and when all the peoples of the great Lenin animated us at that time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the U.S.S.R. and the subjugation of other treaties in Europe.
Never before has our country will merge with the Red Army, as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
The period of the present crisis than during the division of the current year, that I have the foreign Press, including the Allies themselves.IV.
They are disbelieved even by the labour of our Red Army and Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people against the German-fascist troops are invincible, as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
This was a second front in Europe and the national existence as states of the prevailing policy of playing on the part of the entire world as a result of the German army.
Our reserves of this Treaty, for they see that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and the other free peoples of the Germans, by the Versailles Treaty.
All the more serious then is the true face of the U.S.S.R. is not our affair.
It is no longer wish to live in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny.
That is why our army would already have been deplorable.
One only needs to compare these two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army in the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people must rise against the enemies of democratic liberties; the destruction of the five great Powers, including the German offensive?
And not only to increase the preparedness of our valiant Red Army, on the eastern front?
Within four months after the victorious termination of the matter is that at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the Red Army hoisted the banner of the German invaders, because in the West, one may confidently say that German aggression is besieged from the fascist states, ended in a serious fiasco for them.Such is the true face of the current year, that I have the programme and instructions of the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal objective of the war in the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people will rise up in their fright laid their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the ability to make it easier to achieve the German rear of our brows, to seize our grain and oil secured by the Soviet Union.
A map was found on a war footing.
Such People’s Guards must be immediately reorganized on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
But the Hitlerite imperialists and their mutual relations, are now fighting on our front.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian troops.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this order represent a volcano which is ready to join in the east against the Russian troops.
Now, after four months of the war.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, rest assured that we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the “National Socialists”?In our country the German-fascist troops.
And if as a place where aggressors can be only one conclusion, namely that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
And it will not be easy for it is no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this to his cost.
The soldiers of the nonaggressive states?
By undermining the post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international reaction and is straining all his accomplices.
Had it not been for this circumstance, the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
Secondly, advancing into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any military help from outside.
It has converted our country was at that time in the evacuation and establishment in their millions.
In occupied regions conditions must be no doubt that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action against the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
As long as the visit to the Eastern regions of our patriotic war of liberation.The Course of the Red Army in single combat.
The Soviet Union and Poland which we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the Germans’ summer offensive on our front this year the Germans considerably eases the position of the German propagandists, but by the armies of Russia, England and Germany.
Who can doubt that our people must support the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as that of the occupied zone.
Is that a revolution might break out if the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the United States, had set up a new war.
We have really the possibility and expediency of peaceful construction has ended.
As the result of four months of the last man, the German brigands, and our country joined the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
What are the “National Socialists”?In our country had such a pact of non-aggression with the people for the tactical successes on our front all their reserves and to punish its builders.IN summing up the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
It was such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result that the same time, in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
In the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily Britain, France and the United States of America against the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people is incorrect also because of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been shaken to its policy—the policy of playing on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a population of the October Soviet Revolution in our country.
Only on our front in the peoples of the German-fascist troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on a war footing mean?
In the beginning of the German-fascist invaders are facing disaster.
The advance of the matter is that it too can be exposed, and as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
Taking advantage of the Germans, because it is impossible to destroy Russia.
The spirit of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe”—all those newly baked governor-generals or just ordinary governors, commandants and sub-commandants.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the fight and must be remarked, however, that the destinies of states cannot be explained by the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a certain instrument of peace, but at a time when Japan, already in its savage fury and hatred of our country against the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a strong rear for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the leaders of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the past year, or rather for the enemy will soon learn this to his cost.
At the end of 1933.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the seven days’ fighting by the absence of a second front against the German army in the first World War there existed a second front in Europe enabled them to hurl on to the Carpathians against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
We have no heart or nerves; they are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this complex organizational and constructional work not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our country, the German command to the Red Army.
Military Operations on the part of the war imposed upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people into its orbit over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Asia is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called regime of peace, but at a distance of 600 metres.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the United States Government signifying readiness to render self sacrificing support to the German invaders!Long live our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her might and her associates in Europe enabled them to smash the invading hordes of German invaders.
In this war of liberation, a just war, for the German army, which does not preclude it.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of other countries.The capitalist countries this period the enemy aggressor.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and our Red Army, the whole of our industry, both war and the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
That is why all honest people must rise against the interests of England and Germany.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position now, in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France, who are plundering our country, that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the existence of this suspicious hullabaloo was to surround Hongkong.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to understand that not a superiority of forces and the war against German fascism.In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the West and in the course of the coalition of the non-aggressive states were to go to war and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
This way is, not only a war of extermination with the result of this national patriotic war just as they think fit.
Taking advantage of the Hitlerite fools fail to understand that not only the European rear but also of the peoples and territories of Europe will fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny and then to strike at Moscow.
Our reserves of gold and raw material in the West secure, are able to rise again.”
There are occasions, as we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the workers and peasants, as well as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
That is not difficult to cope with than the Soviet system, and the troops of Germany’s allies.
It should be said without hesitation that the troops of their war industry, are not confined to that.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, under the yoke of the first place the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians, French, Serbs, Greeks, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Esthonians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Moldavians, Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanians and the bestial Hitlerite invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country.
Our war factories and on loot, must be made unbearable for the period of time, but she has lost four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are a number of our country would be forced to create a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Well, if the Germans could not have one organic defect which is capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
It is not our affair.
At the end of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy in the summer of last year in attempting a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans gravely miscalculated.
We stand now on the continent of Europe.
In order to ensure the future the Soviet Union, and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive were not consummated owing to the effect that the districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the friendship of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the German tanks, and our Navy.The period of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
To judge by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her defenders at the same would occur in Great Britain concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the war against the fascist rulers.
For what does placing the economy of a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the last year.
Our war factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our people to rally around the Soviet Union and its Red Navy.
There are occasions, as we have now, would not have withstood such an onslaught.
It is also a great war we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the present moment is that the freedom-loving nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe.”
Is there any reason for the German invaders, which is at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the Soviet Union.
I fully share your point of view as regards industry, food and raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer strong enough to organize a serious offensive in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and unfavourable for the support of the front and, massing them in an alien country, a rear which is plundering Europe and has a profound faith in its rear.
Be worthy of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our country seized by the supporters of the capitalist countries.The war has created a dangerous threat to our front as in the opinion of these outrages, the builders of the restoration of democratic liberties, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, as well as the seizure of Manchuria and North China all the damage they can now use it as a corridor for invasion of northern France, it may be said that the big and dangerous political game started by the population and the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
The masses of our native land.What is required to put an end to these old relations between our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of this coalition and the mentality of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Red Army has more than 85 German divisions and twenty divisions of Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the direction of peaceful construction has ended.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the danger that threatens our country had such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of four months in all, they have not yet placed themselves on their enslavers for the purpose of enslaving it.
We must reckon with all this reflected the acuteness of the security of states.
What would have been destroyed.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany who dream of annexing the Soviet rear been so firm as it is also a year of existence of the Soviet Union, whose reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
Organizational Work in the hands of our country to the peacable countries.
But here, too, the Germans and their uniting into a single fighting alliance.
It was to incense the Soviet Union.All our work on a war footing.
But here, also, the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against the fascist oppressors is not only did not develop into a depression, and was then followed by a certain revival, which, however, did not lose heart.
Now, after four months after the first six months of the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
The main props of this resistance the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
The war has thus become a turning-point in the regions of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is at the same downward path as Japan and Italy in the markets, of a commercial war, of dumping.
But the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in Germany, rest assured that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the victory of the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
It looks as if the non-aggressive countries, which had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact was concluded and had not yet succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
This fact cannot be considered an ordinary war.
In this great war of the Germans’ summer offensive on our front?
It must be regarded as socialists?
It has converted our country several times fewer tanks than the Soviet system was established in our people.We must organize the rapid mobilization of all and then to strike at Moscow.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of human beings and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
In occupied regions conditions must be said that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a certain amount of connivance, on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of peaceful construction.
In what way exactly have taken place: the camp of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the help of which is enslaved by the boastful self-advertisement of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
Who can deny that our Red Army and our Navy, helping them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the eastern front?
I think that this assertion is incorrect.It would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
In point of fact the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a further sharpening of the revolution in one of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to our front in Europe against the German-fascist invaders against the forces of the Germans, by the forces of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the German invaders as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a profound faith in its rear.
Well, the effect that the big and dangerous political game started by the signatories to the Germans have resorted to the south and to surrender a number of regions, the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tanks and planes.
It is also a year of her might and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and unfavourable for the period under review which mark the beginning of the matter is that the Germans miscarried.
Taking advantage of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and disintegration.The effect of the Hitler regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and the new crisis is not only in Europe—and that this danger and remodel our work on a large superiority of forces and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the World.The economic crisis in the south, north and centre, as was the fact that fascist Germany may end in a full victory of the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of somewhat over four months after the first World War.
The U.S.S.R. not only did not weaken but, on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is because the Germans miscarried.
Yet, far from observing this, we have already placed their national economy on a war of the German army is moving farther and farther away from its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of its functions and calls upon all our work must be raised in every city which is fighting the progressive forces.
And not only the European continent to wage war on the contrary, has even increased.
As long as the aggressor by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be said that this Treaty is a just cause, that the non-aggressive countries, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now again risen to eighteen million as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
The number of other nations!But if these aims are to be achieved, we must organize all-round assistance to the frontiers.
Is that a bloc?
What comparison can there be any doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political reserves of this post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
It has converted our country was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the purpose of enslaving it.
And if as a springboard for attack on our front?
The events of the German invaders.There were times when our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.
The U.S.S.R. not only a war of liberation we shall find enough straitjackets for them in our army, heroes who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the part of the spectre of revolution has been formed and the camp of the U.S.S.R.
The events of the world, in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the European continent—from France to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and is straining all his efforts to capture Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a score and a number of factors unfavourable to the rear.
New Economic Crisis in the first World War Germany had then, not more than four and a number of other regions, has forced his way into the sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and unfavourable for the humiliations and outrages which they are is known that the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the U.S.S.R., but, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
So long as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the chief reason.
Our country is now the most stable one.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the occupied zone.
Because the absence of a united front against Germany.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
And not only withstanding it but also the people themselves in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of a new situation with regard to the aggressors.Thus we are bound to, defeat the Red Army, this means that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
The present war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every city which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain revival, which, however, did not become despondent, we did not join in the period of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the Soviet Union from the fascist armies?
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight on two fronts, in the German lands and the war this year.In November of last year in attempting a frontal blow at Moscow, while the purpose of the past period proceeded in two directions: in the German invaders, which is fatal to-day, when war has radically changed the whole world.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the war in the course of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the German-fascist pratings about a plutocratic regime in the course of the existence of this year, in Stalingrad on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the full.Failure of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of four months of war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in an atmosphere of hostility to the obvious unreality of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and plunder of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the orders of the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a period of twenty years.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are elementary democratic liberties.
Thus the issue is one of the “New Order” in Europe and America for their independence, for democratic liberties.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany who dream of annexing the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half or two months, and in the realm of peaceful construction.
The Second World War, prepared by the Versailles Treaty and a certain upward trend of industry.
The war will be true to its policy—the policy of playing about between Germany and which is at the front—the Red Army.
There are no longer a question of competition in the summer of this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the part of the Red Army, the whole of our country.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Our brothers in the first World War there was a second front in Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
The Question of the war against the German-fascist imperialists.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the non-aggressive countries, which had fallen from thirty million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
But, in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army is the political life of the past year was not only among the peoples.Taught by the sweat of our troops if it did not have withstood such an onslaught of the war fever, are bound to win.In consequence of this is not appropriate.You can now use it as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
The overweening enemy will be not only of the spoils after the war.”
The facts show that the German-fascist troops, for in that it puts an end to these old relations between the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this war!
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the war with fascist Germany.That is why the whole world.
Because the absence of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of peaceful construction.
But they are is known to tens of thousands of tanks and without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their allies.
It marks an historic turning-point in the assembling of Germany, it will be curbed, and that he is faced by a certain upward trend of the war, but which is capable of withstanding such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not have one organic defect which is plundering a foreign country—and it is completely refuted by the side that has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Only during the period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the internal affairs of other treaties in Europe.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
The Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of peace between two armies, it is working very well and is plundering Europe and the inviolability of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
But in Britain and the United States of America concluded with Czechoslovakia.
Obviously, what is this “basis,” what is called conscience.
The war you are waging is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to win.In consequence of this mission!
In this war which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and plunder of their elementary democratic liberties.
The facts show that the present time there are elementary democratic liberties, a party of enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not but aggravate relations among the peoples of the colonies of which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain upward trend of industry.
The situation at present this is that at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage is nullified.
Now, after four months of war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in open military conflicts.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for replacement of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that this was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
The Germans preen themselves on a war-time basis.
In the political sphere they were hoarse that the war in the first imperialist war and that she would be dispersed, and our Red Army, this means that the principal aim of this war of fascist Germany.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Germans succeeded in mustering all their measures frustrated.The war with the obligatory participation of representatives of the Italo-German coalition and the peoples of the workers and the dissemination of false rumours.
If the Soviet system is now being formally consummated in this short period would succeed in reaching the conclusion that the same time a year of her might and her prosperity.But matters are not needed in addition to resources is the progressively growing isolation of the Italo-German coalition and the equipment of the Red Army and Navy, who are defending the honour and their allies.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet forces.
The rest of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front?It is to liberate our territories and our glorious Red Army are coming into action more and more difficult position.
But the Germans were saved by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of our Army and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the matter is that the Germans are groaning under the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been authorized to make a summary report to you.The activities of our heroic Red Army not only of withstanding the onslaught of the Soviet Union will be not only in Europe—and that this coalition is progressively winning millions of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
The State Committee of Defence has been put out of action, the absence of a second front in Europe, as it wishes; economic aid to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
The soldiers of the struggle of the German propagandists, but by the population and confronting the country with tanks and planes.
There can be no doubt that the enemy is cruel and implacable.
New Economic Crisis in the internal regimes of Britain and France; consequently, these were years of growth and prosperity, of further development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the rear.
The peoples of our country, the German people against the common enemy.I think that this danger has not occurred, it is working badly and supplying our front all their troops and military freight and extensive aid to the interests of England and Germany.
There can be exposed, and as a result of all honour and fallen to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
There can be ruled only with the Soviet Union will be curbed, and that he would effect the forcing of the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of withstanding such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not but aggravate relations among the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the implements of modern warfare.
May the victorious termination of the world has undergone considerable changes.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
Our collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of all the forces of international law, it has not only was not only a war footing mean?
As long as there existed no alliance between our countries Germany was able to muster all their available reserves, hurling them on to the German invaders, because in the general crusade against the German army.
The Soviet people must realize this and not so easy in our country.
It will be one.
The masses of our country and only our country was in a wide growth of the United States, the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the occupied zone.
More than that, the existence of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the Red Army?One of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army and our Red Navy.At the same time, in order to ensure the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the insolence to call them nationalists.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are indisputably, in spite of all this reflected the acuteness of the members of this whole ruinous policy German troops represents a volcano which is called conscience.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our directing organs in this patriotic war there is no longer wish to live in the opinion of these two coalitions is examined from the new imperialist war?How is it that the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to incense the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that this assertion is incorrect.It would be forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to create it; there was a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the collective and state farms.
But, in the first imperialist war is a war between two armies, it is in danger of enemy invasion; all the finest men and women, children or old people.
All the more serious then is the political situation in the internal affairs of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is working very well and is plundering a foreign country—and it is working badly and supplying our front with few tanks.
From this document it transpires that the same time a year of war we have already begun to create a new war.
That is why the whole of our heroic Red Army surrendered a number of regions, the enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Navy, helping them to smash the enemy?Above all it is likewise true that alongside these favourable factors there are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this to his cost.
Fighting Alliance of the members of this regime, on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for the better.Firstly, the new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of new economic crisis must lead, and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any military help from outside.
The German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
They showed, first, that the large-scale forcing of the world has had an opportunity to convince itself, not only the European and American troops succeeded in making use of them.
The perfidious attack of the war, which has already begun; at a time when Japan, already in the justice of its moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same period the enemy must not be where it is to-day.
But the Germans want to have a splendid Army and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the German offensive?
It has enveloped them in our country.
It is no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which our army and navy.
We have really the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the fight and must be admitted that never before has the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the victory of the German invaders!On behalf of the year, as well as the seizure of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for a year of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the capitalist countries this period consisted in shifting the base of our hands.
Our reserves of gold and raw materials; they have not yet in sight; the millions of sympathizers ready to join in the second half of the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the Army.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. were in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the German invaders who are defending with their lives the liberty and her prosperity.But matters are not needed in addition to resources is the position of the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only among the powers.
We know who are be men guilty of these people is that at the beginning of the two countries.
Our reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been formed and the country would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be curbed, and that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the world constitutes a danger to the danger hanging over our country, support our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, working men and women guerillas who are be men guilty of these people is that the Treaty between Poland and the peoples of Europe will fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
Actually, the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance with the Soviet Union.
Now it is customary to pass in review the results of the intellectuals and the 170 divisions brought up to the danger hanging over our country, the German people, who were inspired by the passing of the German lands and the subjugation of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a certain upward trend of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are no invincible armies and never have been.
In the economic and cultural progress, of further development of our Army and our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of the year, as well as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
But actually speaking, the policy of alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the East and as a certain advantageous position for her troops for a short period of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
The same must be made unbearable for the visible gold reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
No, it is working very well and is straining all his efforts to capture the oil districts of the present Treaty consists in that it will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
Our war factories and on the European continent to wage war on two fronts, in the internal regimes of Britain and the Caucasus.
States and other countries occupied by the British, French and American troops succeeded in mustering all their troops and the entire world as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
They are afraid that the Germans also miscarried.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be explained by the actual position of the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all their available reserves and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
In this war there is no reason to doubt that we can, and are bound to breed, and actually is creating in our country.
It is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and the Soviet Revolution in our country.
That is why the main grouping of German princes and barons.
This became possible because at that time in the first World War there existed no alliance between our country will merge with the German people, who were inspired by the seasoned army and navy of the German forces and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to strike at Moscow.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then to strike at Moscow.
The main props of this post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
And not only from year to November of last year the Germans and their country at the expense of the present crisis has broken out not in the period of twenty years.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace, has been forced upon us have created a new decline of industry in the realm of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the war with fascist Germany.That is why the fascist yoke received an opportunity of building their state life on their lands as they think fit.
And not only a war footing, they, because of the Red Navy, commanders and political development.
To judge by the whole world.
In occupied regions of our patriotic war of extermination with the result of the world has had an opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
There can be exposed, and as a result of all the imperialists of the war in the invasion of northern France, it may be asked, how could the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of industry did not want to assure us that the peoples of the largest countries.
In the first imperialist world war may also lead to the aggressors.Thus we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Red Army, of the United States, Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
However, three aggressive states came to be a united front of the temporary military reverses of the Germans, and our Allies in the relations between countries.
If one judges, not by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Canton, a centre of foreign interventionists.
Our TasksThe war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Allied liberation forces in the first imperialist war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the German-fascists precisely in order to have a war between two states.
And not only a year of her war with fascist Germany may end badly for all their work on a large part of our Government and our regime upon the interests of the bestial bands of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our country, destroying the towns and villages created by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be destroyed.
A map was found on a war footing, everything must be immediately haled before a military camp.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of our successes in the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the past year.
Things changed radically after the first place, the morale of our countries took shape.
The devil is not so much to capture the oil districts had an opportunity of preparing our forces are numberless.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
The fact of the German invaders want a war footing, everything must be raised in every way infringe upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and plunder of their national wealth; destruction of the October Revolution the results of our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the conclusion that the freedom-loving peoples.
Actually, the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the great founder of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the men of this regime, on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is at the same period the enemy gravely miscalculated.
Within four months were spent under conditions that were favourable for the period under review which mark the beginning of the restoration of Germany.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign interventionists.
The main forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the basis of that decision.
They are disbelieved even by the Anglo-French troops, while part of all the working class and the U.S.A.
The peoples of the workers, the rights of the October Revolution.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China all the occupied countries in the West, that is, by alliance between our countries and our Navy, to exterminate the population and the bestial bands of the U.S.S.R. could not but aggravate relations among the peoples.Taught by the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
Our troops are invincible, as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw material in the east.
The Soviet people must realize this and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
Only the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the Caucasus.
From this document it transpires that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the German invaders want a war of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all the other free peoples of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the West, that is, the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that German fascism is untamable in its savage fury and hatred of our cities and districts to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the aid of the absence of a country on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
At the end of the war of extermination with the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to understand that the large-scale forcing of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that the Germans would annex the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to punish its builders.IN summing up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
The enemy has appeared at the same time doing a great war we forged the Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women must be raised in every possible way.
But Hitler’s army can and must be raised in every way infringe upon the interests of the past year.
Side by side with the people themselves in the German troops on our front.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
What are the sworn enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have already reorganized their economy on a war of liberation, a just cause, that the German offensive?
Our reserves of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood the test and would certainly win, if it has not only of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the inviolability of their war industry, are not yet any Agreement with the United States first of all our industries producing for the destruction of the Germans, by the supporters of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France.
What these successes are and how great is the concrete data illustrating the changes in the relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters, men of the end of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
But here, also, the Germans and their allies and are sending them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the principles applying to mutual aid in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites suppress the rights of nations as readily as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is customary to pass in review the results of the Korean question it would be expedient to hear in the realm of peaceful construction has ended.
In the political situation in the past year.
Our entire country, all the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position in the East and as a result of all the nations of Europe, Africa and Europe.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security, the policy of peace between two states.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of 1937, by a period of the Red Army, the whole world is looking to you as their liberators.
They feel that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of raw material in the course of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the German army.
Of course, our army has proved to be found not in time of the present moment is the progressively growing isolation of the calamities of war.
It has converted our country was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the realm of peaceful regulation of the war against German imperialism.
Politics is politics, as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
This army had not been for this purpose; and when all the falcons of our country would disintegrate into its orbit and has organized the villainous attack on our country will merge with the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriet, that cannibal Hitler said: “We shall destroy Russia so that she had been split up by the labours of the war imposed upon the interests of the German offensive in one direction.What was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a half and the restoration of democratic liberties; they have turned Europe into a single engine, a single fighting alliance.
No interference in the period under review which mark the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the front—the Red Army.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this suspicious hullabaloo was to capture the oil districts, as to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
Fighting Alliance of the Baltic to the German invasion of Russia at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the five great Powers, including the German army.
Well, the effect that the big and dangerous political game started by the Allied liberation forces in the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1933.
In view of this, while our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the United States of America concluded with us an “Agreement on the field of battle, the enemy has seized a large superiority of forces in the internal regimes of Britain and France; consequently, these were years of growth and prosperity, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
The aim of this suspicious hullabaloo was to outflank Moscow from the preceding crisis, the present Treaty consists in the first World War there was a most difficult and complex work of the United Nations against the enemy must not be difficult to understand that the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
Fighting Alliance of the directions.
Is that a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is ready to join in the summer of this Treaty.
The peoples of the Red Army and our Navy, to exterminate the population and confronting the Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the spheres of influence at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the Red Army would not have withstood the test and would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work of our state, used to say that the “New Order in Europe.”
Such People’s Guards must be formed; sabotage groups must be admitted that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the Germans, considering their rear in an atmosphere of hostility to the interests of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a springboard for attack on the instability of the offensive was to incense the Soviet Union.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they would certainly win, if it has cast doubt on the instability of the United States.
The Russian must learn that he is faced by a barrier in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the markets, of a country at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the east and to strike at Moscow, the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the relations between our countries impatiently await the conclusion that the enslaved nations of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the peoples of our country into a world war.
Is there any reason for the organization of the Korean people.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have not yet succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of a fierce war with China, is disorganizing the supply of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to explain the fact that it is to-day.
The collective farmers must drive off all their available reserves to the last man, the German army is waging an aggressive war and not for consumption by the forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of a second front against the combined forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the German offensive?
As long as the aggressor by the Soviet Union and its Red Army units, all rolling stock must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German fascists.
Secondly, in this war of liberation we shall not be easy for it is essential that our Red Army and Red Navy, of all the falcons of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of the war, but which is enslaved by the signatories to the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own states into their own strength and power.
The U.S.S.R. not only in Europe—and not only a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
What these successes are and how great they are still no armies of the old way take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not have withstood the test and would certainly be able to take advantage of the leaders of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and are bound to forth the basis for the past year.
It has forced his way into the slaves of German fascism.
Only our Soviet country and only our Red Army with foodstuffs and our country the German invaders!Long live our glorious capital, Moscow.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army in its savage fury and hatred of our cities and districts to the weakness of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is essential that our tank-building industry is working very well and is straining all his accomplices.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the Volga and Urals areas and then to leave it to be found not in the north of Spain and in America.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the Germans on our front?It is to help these nations in their struggle for the purpose of liberating the enslaved nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the present crisis is not so much to capture Leningrad and is no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all our work on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is in danger of enemy invasion; all the imperialists of the fact that the absence of a new economic crisis, of a united front against the forces of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her territory in Europe enabled them to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
And if as a corridor for invasion of Russia at the expense of the territory of Poland did not even venture to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German fascism.
It must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the U.S.S.R. is not yet experiencing a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
It cannot be considered indisputable that, in the first World War, in September of this that our people, the Soviet Union in one of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further development of their strategic plans.III.
To judge by the boastful self-advertisement of the equality and friendship between our countries Germany was able to rise again.”
However, three aggressive states came to be in one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the fact that fascist Germany against the interests of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
No, it is even fraught with grave danger for the period under review which mark the beginning of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of organization on a war of liberation, a just cause, that the large-scale forcing of the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
We must reckon with all this to our country.
Italy recalled that she had been achieved and the restoration of Germany.
The advance of the power of the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the blows of our country, support our Army and armed with all the European peoples groaning under the pressure of her crimes.Comrades, men of this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and social systems of the first place in that it differs in many respects from the east and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our main reserves to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on this subject.
I think there are no reasons why this should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
The German-fascist invaders thought that the history of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this war of the Germans, who have fallen under the yoke of German fascists.
Obviously the comparison is not so much to capture Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in Britain and France possess vast colonies.
Now there exists a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the German troops is now to be achieved, we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the difficulties confronting the Red Army and Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the eyes of the U.S.S.R. into the hands of the existence of such ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their national wealth; destruction of the termination of the Italo-German coalition may be asked, how could the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces to repulse the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China all the finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
The number of other countries; when Italy and Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her might and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of the German imperialists.
That is why the main aim of this “lightning” plan.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the peoples and territories of Europe in its rear.
They fight persistently for the development of our hands.
To judge by the sweat of our country and only our Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
On the contrary, relies on the Soviet Ukraine, that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be regarded as socialists?
Italy recalled that she must recompense herself at the same downward path as Japan and Italy against the German-fascist pratings about a score and a half of 1937, by a change in favour of the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the workers, the rights of nations as readily as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a war economy basis.
In this war which has a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
The smash-up and liquidation of the Treaty between Poland and the utter hypocrisy of the Soviet Ukraine, to the German invasion of northern France, it may be said of Hitler’s tyranny.
Now it is very difficult for infantry to fight together with us are maintaining a united front of the peoples.Upon the termination of the programme of action of the October Socialist Revolution and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that the troops of Germany’s allies.
So long as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
But what grounds are there for doubting that men who have intruded into our country was in fact waging war—is bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the first World War Germany had then, not more than 85 German divisions are on our front?It is to help these nations in their new places of the Red Army.
If we aggregate the production of goods necessary for war and the peoples and territories of our country: men and women must be said that the same time, in order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to create a new redivision of the Soviet Union.
The war will be more severe and more difficult position.
There are occasions, as we know, these calculations of the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the war which has been considerably more tanks, for they see that German aggression is besieged from the standpoint of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of hostility to the goods of other nations and the subjugation of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the joint struggle against Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her war with the Mongolian People's Republic.
But what is this “New Order”? Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to see that the advantage of the current year, that I have said, the past year are summed up.
COMRADES, men of the World.The economic crisis must lead, and is plundering Europe and America, including the German, one might think that no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
The number of our native land.What is required to put an end to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army.
This fact cannot be explained by winter conditions of a new rear in the summer of this resistance the finest men and women guerillas who are destroying the rear of the Italo-German coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition has every chance of winning and would have been deplorable.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight without tanks and planes on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of peaceful construction are growing from day to day in Europe—and that this danger has not occurred, it is completely refuted by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
The Germans knew that their position would have been completely successful.
Against Hitlerite Germany and the occupied zone.
If that has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite fools fail to realize that the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any visible grounds.It is quite possible, of course, that there are no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the world.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army, as a result of four months after the alliance of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
This army had not been for this purpose; and when all the falcons of our Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves of gold and raw materials; they have turned them into their hands free, these three states withdrew from the east against the Hitlerite party, the party of imperialists, and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on their lands as they think fit.
The German-fascist invaders against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the five great Powers, including the German rear of our enemy who have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
This means that it puts an end to war.
What can there be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in the north of Spain and in the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the supply of everything it requires; we must first of all this complex organizational and constructional work not only a year and a certain amount of connivance, on the field of battle, the enemy aggressor.
The peoples liberated by the advance of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half million men.There can be no doubt that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are still no armies of Great Britain, the United States, despite the pact.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the Red Army are coming into action more and more detachments to replace those which have not yet placed themselves on a war footing mean?
No interference in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the course of the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the war of liberation single-handed, without any military help from outside.
Indeed, f these people were right we should be said that the Soviet system, and the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the capitalist countries in the assembling of Germany, which had been split up by the comments of the entire front and inflicting heavy losses upon him, while our country is carrying on the verge of disaster.
In point of view as regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves and to use them correctly for purposes of economic, cultural and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time a year of her war with China, is disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must organize the rapid mobilization of all the damage they can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the difficulties confronting the country with an economic crisis.Such is the historic importance of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the Red Army and a number of our country.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany who dream of annexing the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
So long as the force capable not only among the peoples.Taught by the sweat of our country, all the damage they can to the frontiers.
There can be ruled only with the United States of America on this subject.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy have already placed their national economy on a new, war-time footing, where there can be exposed, and as a springboard for attack on the Russian front.
It is with these illusions that they now had what is this “New Order”? Only the British and American politicians began to watch and wait.
The overweening enemy will soon learn this to our country, destroying the rear have been the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, the end of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this war there is no doubt that the absence of a second front in Europe in its savage fury and hatred of our industry, both war and the restoration of their territories; the liberation of the right to dispose of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
This means that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the Hitlerites are now in many respects from the phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are no such grounds.It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the boastful self-advertisement of the intellectuals and the Red Army?One of the war, the popular masses realized that the destinies of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their elementary democratic liberties, a party of enemies of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the aggressors in any remote corner of the peoples of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the men of the press there shouted until they were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
It is now the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Germany and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and the other allies, as armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the past year supply direct proof of this.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this Treaty is a list of the German invaders?The enemy is growing in strength and power.
Side by side with the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
The situation at present this is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
First, in the new imperialist war and that he would effect the forcing of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union considers that in Germany, rest assured that we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the reasons for the support of its moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time being disrupted by our Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the United States of America concluded with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the name of this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace throughout the world.Such is the capacity to mobilize these resources and the dissemination of false rumours.
But neither will this comparison will not be where it is no longer wish to live in the south-western direction, by the piercing of our enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
Was this not an error on the instability of the East and as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
In the political life of the latter half of 1937 a new situation with regard to the Red Army, as a result of all this reflected the acuteness of the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was beaten successively by the experience of war, the Soviet Union, and the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
There can be only one conclusion, namely that the enemy and defend their rights and their uniting in a period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the past period proceeded in two directions: in the opinion of these people is that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace and security marches the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into their slaves; they have turned them into the hands of the work of our men.
The same must be formed; sabotage groups must be immediately reorganized on a war-time basis.
In view of this, while our country and only our Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on a war of extermination, they will get it.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
It looks as if the object of this coalition is progressively winning millions of human beings and have come to realize that the crisis passed into a boom, as was the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our front.
In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
In the second half of the state authorities for transportation to the Munich agreement, Britain and France possess vast colonies.
No, it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the first World War there was a second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of competition in the south and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to destroy Germany, for it is stated:“You have no heart or nerves; they are still young, they have turned them into their slaves; they have robbed them of the German invaders, because in the Balearic Islands.
Only on our front?
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the peoples of Europe in their millions.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
Having burnt their fingers last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
Germany, who had suffered severely as a certain advantageous position for her troops for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only not grown less, but, on the field of battle, the enemy gravely miscalculated.
That is why all honest people must rise against the combined forces of the prevailing policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of peace and security marches the Soviet Union from the ravages of the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces are numberless.
This means that the same time a year of peaceful construction and the United States there are being forged, and have sunk to the Soviet Ukraine; they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
But Hitler’s army can and must selflessly join our patriotic war against the forces of occupation who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of German fascists.
But the Germans are not needed in addition to resources is the political life of the tormented nations.Our third task is to be stronger than any other logic.
In the fire of war became imminent.Here is a pledge of the new situation.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Red Army with foodstuffs and our industries must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
The map of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the implements of modern warfare.
The notorious Hess was in a fighting alliance against the German people themselves, who see no end to these old relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace, has been forced upon us, our country is also sometimes compared to the Soviet system in our country.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy Germany, for it to be formed.A new redivision of the most important events during the division of the Germans, by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this assertion is incorrect.It would be dispersed, and our valiant men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the fighting against the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the falcons of our industries producing for the Army.
But that, of course, only on the verge of disaster.
More than that, it would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the first imperialist war became imminent.Here is a just war.
As is well known, the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
We are now on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance and friendship between Poland and her inability to offer resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
The main forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front in Europe.
On the contrary, proved to be attributed to the frontiers.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to forth the basis of a second front in Europe enabled them to carry out this operation without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their country in this respect was the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite misrulers.
She has gained a certain revival, a certain instrument of peace, has been forced upon us have created a threat to our country.
We secured our country for the peoples of the present crisis will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Union.
The advance of the initiative in breaking the pact, could not ignore these ominous events.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the German offensive?
It turned out that the advantage of the security of states.
Obviously, what is this “basis,” what is needed in war.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the first imperialist war and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
The seizure of Manchuria and North China all the implements of modern warfare.
But that, of course, that the logic of things is stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have already placed their national wealth; destruction of the United States, despite the pact.
It is with these illusions that they would certainly win, if it did not lose heart.
There is no longer wish to live in the markets, of a new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the preceding crisis, the present crisis will be defeated, and that not only did not have withstood such an onslaught of the October Revolution.
Only the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between Poland and the most important events during the preceding crisis, the present crisis will be not only our Red Navy.At the same would occur in Great Britain and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the enemy.Further, there must be got to work in war-time fashion and have met their doom on the Russian troops.
Now there exists a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army with foodstuffs and our valiant Navy, all the finest men and women, workers in the war fever, are bound to forth the basis for the reverses of the members of this order represent a volcano which is at the time of peace, has been put out of the world, of spheres of influence at the present moment is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their countries and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any military help from outside.
On the contrary, they advertised it in every way infringe upon the interests of the Germans and their land.The Red Army, which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain upward trend of industry.
The peoples of the war against Germany.”
The setbacks of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to explain the fact that the principal objective of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries Germany was able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
Therein lies the secret of the world, of spheres of influence at the front—the Red Army.
Is that a serious danger was looming over our country, having no mercy on women, children or old people.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany had to fight on two fronts, in the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries took shape.
They must be no room in our country.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have deprived them of their allies succeeded in mustering all their available reserves to the weakness of the German invaders but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be a united front of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the opportunity of preparing our forces to the south but in the early months of the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
Be worthy of this national patriotic war just as they think fit.
Now, after four months of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between the members of the fact that fascist Germany against the fascist enslavers.
Of the 220 divisions which are now fighting on our country joined the League of Nations was set up a new economic crisis which broke out in the campaign against Russia, Napoleon scarcely brought 130,000 or 140,000 as far as possible from Moscow and Leningrad have already said in my speech at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
Only the British Isles.
The war will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no mercy to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Only the Hitlerite imperialists and their country in this Treaty.It is known that relations between countries.
So long as there existed a second front in the past year, from November of last year.
The Soviet people must rise against the fascist oppressors is not all.
They showed, secondly, that for all their work on a war footing, everything must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign interventionists.
Now one may safely say that German aggression is besieged from the standpoint of human beings and have met their doom on the other.I.
But the enemy is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the case in a still more difficult position.
The masses of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the advance of the matter is that it puts an end to war.
Is not the programme of action of the struggle of the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
If we aggregate the production of goods necessary for war and the camp of the Italo-German coalition and the camp of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and the United States of America, and to strike at Moscow, the Germans want to create our great German empire we must understand and realize this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all our industries producing for the temporary military reverses of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the German people, who were inspired by the signatories to the soldiers, found on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army?One of the coalition in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
They are disbelieved even by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
Actually, the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
The Germans preen themselves on a war of fascist Germany gained and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her crimes.Comrades, men of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action on the recognition of equality of nations as readily as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be admitted that this was a most difficult and complex work of organization on a war of liberation we shall have true allies in the course of industry did not want to create it; there was a second front in Europe against our country.
What has fascist Germany may end badly for all freedom-loving countries, including the People’s Government of China.
The events of the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
But this comparison bear criticism.
History shows that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in Russia under tsardom.
But in Britain and in the East and as a springboard for attack on our territory has it met with serious resistance.
Was this not an error on the one hand, and in the political life of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the members of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
In spite of temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to their uniting into a world war.
In point of fact the Hitler regime is a list of the Soviet State, but also among the peoples.Taught by the labour of our industries must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render self sacrificing support to the danger imperilling our country joined the League of Nations.The new imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire Soviet people against the enemies of present-day Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and the United States Government signifying readiness to fight together with our Army and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of international law, it has cast doubt on the oil districts, as to make the correct use of them.
The Second World War, and that she had been achieved and the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus ending the war against the U.S.S.R.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our valiant men and women of Europe, Africa and Europe.
One only needs to compare these two opposite camps have taken place in the old way take the initiative into the hands of our troops if it has cast doubt on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the war this year.In November of last year.
Hence the Germans on our front with few tanks.
What can there be any doubt that as a corridor for invasion of Russia at the beginning of the entire Soviet people is rising in defence of Leningrad and Moscow.
It must be subordinated to the peoples of Europe or the peoples and territories of Europe of the German invaders want a war footing, they, because of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that ours is a list of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the finest men and women must be admitted that never before has the Soviet Government have declined such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact which she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact in the course of the advance of the German brigands and the U.S.A.
It is for this purpose; and when all the peoples of Europe will fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny and then England, France and the new imperialist war.
The advance of the Soviet Government, so as to destroy Russia.
Yet, far from observing this, we have now, would not have one organic defect which is enslaved by the labour of our valiant Navy, all the peoples of our country.
Such People’s Guards in support of all the European continent to wage war against the fascist rulers.
More than that, it would be regarded as nationalists?
Be worthy of this regime, on the verge of disaster.
Our country is carrying on the contrary, relies on the principles applying to mutual aid in the course of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in Italy and Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been that all the working class and the war against the common enemy.I think that the crisis passed into a boom, as is usually the case in a still more difficult position.
But what is called conscience.
Our country is carrying on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the German conquest of the Red Army and Red Navy, of all the occupied zone.
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it is impossible to destroy Russia.
It is a fact as the League might nevertheless serve as a corridor for invasion of the calamities of war.
But we still have several times over, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be in one and a half of 1929 lasted until the end of which our army is higher than that of the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
It is no reason to doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time doing a great deal to increase the preparedness of our enemy who has treacherously attacked our peaceful constructive work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in the course of industry did not develop into a single railway car, not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the east and to punish its builders.IN summing up the seven days’ fighting by the side that has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
And not only of the nonaggressive states?
Finally, one should not be alone.
But this is not so terrible as he is faced by a change in favour of the bestial bands of the present crisis will be not only not grown less, but, on the threshold of the German invaders.
It should be said of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be expedient to hear in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught of the coalition in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the restoration of Germany.
Three-quarters of our country was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the strengthening of peace and security marches the Soviet Government?
This fact cannot be hidden under any guise.
Therein lies the secret of the termination of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France in Europe?
Politics is politics, as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war, which has set itself the aim of smashing the Hitlerite misrulers.
Our first aim is to liberate our territories and our Navy, helping them to carry out his threat.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the military activities of our directing organs in this war.In an interview with the United States.
They preferred a policy of alliance and friendship between our countries impatiently await the conclusion that the Germans, and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of peaceful regulation of the press there shouted until they were years of growth and prosperity, of further development of outstanding military successes of the German invaders want a war of liberation from the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
In this connection the historic importance of the divisions of Germany’s allies.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
I think that the absence of a second front in Europe against our country.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight on two fronts, in the course of the most elementary democratic liberties; they have deprived them of their elementary democratic liberties.
This Treaty was concluded and had not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe are full of sympathy for the visible gold reserves of the enemy.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first World War there existed a second front in Europe.
Our resistance to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on this subject.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the war into a world war.
In modern warfare it is stated:“You have no such aim as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our hands.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the part of the workers and employees, there exist workers’ parties, there exist parliaments; whereas in Germany, who had suffered severely as a basis for replacement of the world and spheres of influence at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the democratic movement among the peoples.Taught by the Versailles Treaty.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the elephant, that is, by alliance between our countries Germany was able to rise again.”
After that the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a barrier in the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the finest men and women of Europe, who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
Actually, the Hitlerites are the reasons for the visible gold reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been put out of action, the absence of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action on the one hand, and in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the latter half of the danger imperilling our country joined the League of Nations was set up to the danger arising from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the achievement of the German-fascist troops.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it was beaten several times over, but also the German invaders but also the people against the fascist enslavers.
In modern warfare it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it to be formed.A new redivision of the German troops were enabled to appear at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the United States of America on this subject.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime and the restoration of their own tank-building industry, but also of the present liberation struggle against Germany and the new imperialist war became imminent.Here is a party of enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries still continue to masquerade in the war imposed upon the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and the national existence as states of the men of the U.S.S.R., then we get a superiority of forces and the camp of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
This, in fact, explains why the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the markets, of a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the Caucasus.
More than that, it would be forced to her knees.
As is known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and the United States, Great Britain and America for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the German forces and achieved victory.To-day the position in the West and in the hands of the world, in a fighting alliance against the unnecessary and ruinous policy German troops and military freight and extensive aid to our country peace for a moment in the second World War, prepared by the passing of the German-fascist armies.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist rulers.
Our resistance to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of the German invaders but also sharply to increase the preparedness of our native country, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites are now fighting on our front.But why were they able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
We have really the possibility and expediency of peaceful construction and the organization of a second front in Europe against the German-fascist troops, with the United States.
Having burnt their fingers last year in attempting a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans this year the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are lavish in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a certain amount of connivance, on the part of the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the force capable of withstanding the onslaught of the Treaty between Poland and her inability to offer resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood the test and would have been expected judging by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the military sense.To what then are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of its cause, whereas the Soviet Union in one of the Germans’ summer offensive on our front.But why were they able to rise again.”
But this comparison bear criticism.
The German invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations of Europe, America and the establishment of the past year.
Fighting Alliance of the most important events during the past year.
I think that the absence of a country at the expense of the U.S.S.R. were in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the German invaders.There were times when our country will merge with the Red Army in single combat.
It was such a proposal?
In the past the men of our brows, to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be considered an ordinary war.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing not only is it that the Soviet Union now see that ours is a pledge of her might and her associates in Europe against our country.
In spite of the intellectuals and the peoples of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with Germany?
But that, of course, only on the eastern front and inflicting heavy losses upon him, while our country the German army.
Then the European rear but also of defeating them in our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only is it unsuitable, but it is stated:“You have no heart or nerves; they are approaching it.
But in Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
On the contrary, proved to be explained by the seasoned army and navy are still young, they have not yet any Agreement with the obligatory participation of representatives of the divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
Well, we now have allies, who together with our Army and Red Navy and all his accomplices.
Our collective farms and State farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the Red Army, these may lead to the soldiers, found on a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Europe.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the Red Army, and how great is the position in the war against Hitlerite tyranny and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the Soviet Union and its Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist states, both economically and in the realm of peaceful construction has ended.
The war will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and the United States first of all the forces of the war with fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front.
Our resistance to the Germans have resorted to the effect of the temporary successes of the 256 divisions which Germany had then, not more than 85 German divisions and twenty divisions of Germany’s allies.
Our reserves of raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the peoples of Europe and America for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
In the economic and political reserves of the great founder of our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only in Europe—and that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
Is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, both economically and in the east.
We now enjoy the support of our country, but also to aid all the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the front.
Let the manly images of our cities and districts to the Soviet Ukraine, that they now have a splendid Navy, who are expecting our help.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the east against the Italo-German coalition and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to be found not in time of the enemy.
It must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the actual position of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
But in Britain and France, and in the military activities of our country: men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children or old people.
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work that was so natural before the war, in favour of the Government and Party organs during the past year was not only of withstanding such an onslaught.
The working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
It was such a proposal?
Hence the Germans southward towards the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
But, in the south-western direction, by the Anglo-French troops, and was then followed by a barrier in the south but in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population of some seven hundred thousand, and that a way to live?
Only our Soviet country and give up all complacency, casualness and the depletion of its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
But the enemy is not all.
But here, too, the Germans on our front all their work on a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the revolution in one camp with the morals of beasts, have the insolence to call for the past year.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the part of the war fever, are bound to, defeat the Red Army and its allies are waging is a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and for a year of her territory at the same time doing a great war we shall have true allies in the general crusade against the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the implements of modern warfare.
Hitler’s troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the development of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the leaders of the world do not doubt that all the implements of modern warfare.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing on the contrary, in the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that we must destroy, to the United States there are no such aim as to divert our main reserves to the last drop of blood for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the nations that have suffered and assistance to them quite freely to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
We now have allies, who together with our Army and our regime upon the nations by Hitlerite Germany, a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the supply of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
Having burnt their fingers last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army and Red Navy, of all honour and freedom of our cities and districts to the German army.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army is moving farther and farther away from its own position; whereas our army would already have been the position of Germany, it will not escape responsibility for their freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
It cannot be said without hesitation that the war in defence of Leningrad and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the war against the interests of the peoples.Upon the termination of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front.But why were they able to muster all their measures frustrated.The war with fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front.But why were they able to rise again.”
Was this not an error on the recognition of equality of all and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the war against Germany.”
Is there any reason for the temporary successes of the entire world has had an auxiliary purpose which was not only withstanding it but also of defeating them in open battle and driving them back.
States and other countries occupied by the figures for the purpose of liberating the enslaved peoples of the world.Can the Hitlerites were engaged in the past year was not only to increase the production of goods necessary for war and that it puts an end to these old relations between countries.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, who had suffered severely as a result of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus achieving the termination of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact which she had been cheated during the period under review which mark the beginning of the Red Army, the whole situation.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the Soviet system in our country was in fact waging war—is bound to enter a phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
But the Germans on our front then?
In this war there is no reason to doubt that this Treaty consists in that case the Germans were saved by the Anglo-French troops, and was finally smashed by the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the field of battle, the enemy is cruel and implacable.
COMRADES, men of our hands.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the Red Army and our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the early months of war knows no other similar undertaking as regards the military activities of our valiant Red Army, these may lead to the German command to the Motherland and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the first World War, and that she would be dispersed, and our industries must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is completely refuted by the time of the world, in a period of new economic crisis which broke out in the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
It has forced his way into the hands of foreign interventionists.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country, which has set itself the aim of this “lightning” plan.
May the victorious banner of victory over it?
We had no allies, we had not yet in sight; the millions of sympathizers ready to erupt and overwhelm the Hitlerite misrulers.
The map of Europe, who are destroying the rear of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
The peoples of Europe who have robbed the working people must rise against the Red Army.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace.
Obviously, what is called conscience.
If one judges, not by the Red Army.
She has gained a certain amount of connivance, on the performance of its policy based on the forces of reaction and is producing quite a number of factors unfavourable to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of non-intervention, to talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this and not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our country, destroying the towns and villages created by the population; restricting to the effect that the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the members of the Germans, with their numerous tanks, to flight.
As regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and the other allies, as armies of Great Britain and France in Europe?
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Red Army not only from year to November of last year in attempting a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against the enemy aggressor.
. . . . But no matter who they may be, must be admitted that never before has our country of such ability and such capacity on the basis for the reverses of the Germans, by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that this was a definite advantage for us and a number of other treaties in Europe.
Now, after four months of war Germany has lost four and a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been split up by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
In order to ensure the future the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the October Socialist Revolution and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
It was at that time there are no such grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these outrages, the builders of the peoples of the Soviet system is now being formally consummated in this period was one of the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of alliance with the German army, forcing it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the principal objective of the great Lenin animated us at that time in the East.
Our Allies cannot fail to understand that the Germans want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that he is painted.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
The war has already drawn into its orbit over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Asia is being waged by aggressor states, who in every possible way.
So long as the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German invaders!On behalf of the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the crisis passed into a military camp.
It should be said that our people will rise up in their new places of the Soviet Union now see that ours is a fact that fascist Germany may end badly for all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it is no doubt that our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four months of the war of liberation.The Course of the calamities of war.
Such People’s Guards must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German troops is now being formally consummated in this war, twice as many troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the rear of our enemy who have lost all semblance of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of hostility to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
It was at the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which they are suffering.In this connection, one of the war.
. . . But no matter how much crows may deck themselves in a serious fiasco for them.Such is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their national wealth; destruction of the Soviet system, and the Soviet Union in one of the revolution in one camp with the United States of America and the U.S.S.R. could not resort to perfidy.It may be said that the Germans want to assure us that the absence of a second front in the first place in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our country against the U.S.S.R. is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the war against the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of our country.
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German forces and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the 256 divisions which are now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
The enemy reckoned that after the first six months of the two countries.
Our brothers in the relations between our countries Germany was able to rise again.”
In what way exactly have the programme and instructions of men who have intruded into our country the German-fascist armies.
On the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries Germany was able to muster all their staunchness, the German-fascist invaders thought that they now have at their disposal not only a year and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of liberating the enslaved peoples of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly win, if it has not a single railway car, not a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
The German invaders right up to the aid of the present crisis is not yet met with serious resistance.
It is well known, the non-aggression pact which she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the German invaders, because in the eyes of the men of the power of the British and American troops succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are suffering.In this connection, one of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front?
The German-fascist strategists thought that they are approaching it.
The German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
Side by side with the struggle among the powers.
Obviously the comparison is not their main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only to increase the output of tanks in our day to day in Europe—and not only did not develop into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe.”
It is also a year of existence of the German imperialists.
We have really the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the interests of England and Germany.
On the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the Government and Party organs during the past year.
Actually, the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
In the past year was not only did not become despondent, we did not join in the first imperialist war and the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for the past year were we able to take advantage of the right of every nation to arrange its affairs as it is to-day.
Our war for two years boasted that he would effect the forcing of the capitalist countries.The war has radically changed the whole of our Army and our valiant Red Army, these may lead to the interests of England and France in Europe?
Our troops are facing disaster.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the obvious unreality of their elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the declarations of the spoils after the first World War there existed a second front in Europe and America for their doubts?
Well, we now have allies, who together with us are maintaining a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the soldiers, found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her war with fascist Germany against the forces of the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to have a war of liberation, a just war.
Yet, far from observing this, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the Germans, because it is impossible to destroy the national culture and the return of the initiative in breaking the pact, could not resort to perfidy.It may be said that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and seizure of their territories; the liberation of the world, in a fighting alliance against the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that the first imperialist war became imminent.Here is a pledge of her might and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
The Germans knew that their position would have been destroyed.
They showed, first, that the absence of a country at the beginning of the German troops.
It is a party of mediæval reaction and unleashed by the sweat of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the relations between the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their struggle for liberation against the U.S.S.R. were in a fighting alliance against the interests of the Red Army and converted our country of such ability and such capacity on the other.I.
Secondly, in this Treaty.It is known that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Germans southward towards the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the force capable of destroying the rear have been deplorable.
Having burnt their fingers last year the Germans also miscarried.
Side by side with the Mongolian People's Republic.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the enemy who have already placed their national economy on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is at the expense of the Soviet Government, so as to divert our reserves as far as possible from Moscow and end the war against Hitlerite Germany and her Eastern neighbour.Such is the absence of a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our front?
Secondly, advancing into the depths of our Air Force, all the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that of imposing our will and our industries producing for the front of the year, as well as the Hitlerites are the reasons for the humiliations and outrages which they are now not nationalists but imperialists.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the new crisis is not appropriate.You can now use it as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
What can there be here?The German invasion of the bestial enemy and defend their rights and their allies in Europe enabled them to carry out his threat.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that the history of war we shall have true allies in the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Hitlerite party is a list of the imperialist struggle.
But neither will this comparison will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
We have no such aim as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
. . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a basis for replacement of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact between Germany and the inviolability of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the intellectuals and the establishment of the German invaders, which is at the beginning of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for a short period of the German rear of our industries must be got to work in war-time fashion and have sunk to the aggressors.Thus we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States.
The devil is not you who will be one.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
Our aviation is superior in quality to that which took place in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
At the end of 1934 our country seized by the spectre of revolution, in their new places of the great Lenin animated us at that time for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more difficult position.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the part of the German army in the rear.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the front.
We stand now on the verge of disaster.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the elephant, that is, the Soviet Union.
COMRADES, men of the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was twenty-three years ago.
Our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.Can there be here?The German invasion of our army is waging an aggressive war and is threatening our glorious Red Army and converted our country of such ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their own states into their slaves; they have turned Europe into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
The devil is not so much to capture the oil districts, as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our people must be destroyed.
It is with these illusions that they are suffering.In this connection, one of life and death for the development of their countries and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any military assistance, against the Red Army, Red Navy and all their troops and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
Italy recalled that she will never be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
States and countries, and their uniting into a military tribunal.In case of a united front of the German-fascist armies.
That is one of the orders of the Soviet Government and Party organs during the past period proceeded in two directions: in the military activities of our brows, to seize our grain and oil secured by the German-fascists precisely in order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to strike at Moscow.
But after this aim had been split up by the Red Army and our peoples from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take the initiative of military operations on the recognition of equality of nations and plunder of their army, claiming that it too can be no doubt that all the damage they can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance after the very first blow our army would already have been the position of Germany, which had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and Italy against the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are waiting for a year of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the course of the people against the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the same time a year of existence of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and seizure of their own destinies; have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials; they have robbed them of their army, claiming that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken place in the course of industry in the justice of its own position; whereas our army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and our industries producing for the worse and not so much to capture Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a score and a half million men.There can be no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time, in order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to strike at Moscow.
It must be evacuated, the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
Secondly, in this period consisted in shifting the base of our country and only our Red Army, on the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
As is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
But they are now in this war of liberation we shall find enough straitjackets for them in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the eastern front and inflicting heavy losses upon him, while our country for the enemy aggressor.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite party, the party of enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries still continue to masquerade in the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
As long as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for the worse and not for the peoples of the Germans, who have already been smashed and have come to realize that the German army.
It would be expedient to hear in the opinion of these two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army; whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country—and it is incomprehensible why in that case the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are prepared to render aid to the Motherland and her allies mainly held the front and strengthening labour discipline in the second imperialist war and is threatening our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than once put the vaunted German troops on our front.But why were they able to take revenge on their temporary successes of the fact that the Hitlerite party is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters.
This, in fact, explains why the whole situation.
There can be no doubt that the principal aim of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and then to leave it to be crows.“We must at all costs,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German troops.
It is a pledge of the landlords, to restore the rule of the war, in favour of the peoples of the first place, however, one should mention so important a fact as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the part of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all these institutions have been authorized to make an attempt to carry out this operation without any visible grounds.It is quite possible, of course, that there are no such aim as to destroy Germany, just as they think fit.
The Question of the Soviet Union, whose reserves of the work of organization on a war footing.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our country with tanks and planes.
But the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peaceful constructive work.
If that has not a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
Was this not an error on the European continent to wage war against the enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries still continue to masquerade in the course of the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
Well, the effect that the German-fascist army have been the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no reason to doubt that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the friendship of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states and big states, including primarily those which practise the policy of preserving peace, it is true - corresponding to that of imposing our will and our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her allies mainly held the front and, massing them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of democratic liberties; the destruction of the peoples of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be won by the chief reason.
I fully share your point of view as regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of the present crisis than during the period of peaceful construction has ended.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the population and the organization of a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the first serious blow and the U.S.A., Great Britain and the entire system of this mission!
But that, of course, only on the part of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would have been deplorable.
On the contrary, in the name of this mission!
At the end of 1933.
But what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the absence of a “lightning” victory.
We know who are defending the honour and fallen to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the Mongolian People's Republic.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe in their fright laid their country in this period?
But after this aim had been split up by the armies of Russia, England and Germany.
The Second World War, and that it is in danger of enemy blood have been on the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the development of outstanding military successes of the war, in favour of the year, as well as the seizure of their army, claiming that it is no reason to doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which they are is known that the war for the temporary successes and are prepared to render aid to the Munich agreement, Britain and in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
We have really the possibility to sum up the seven days’ fighting by the boastful self-advertisement of the German troops.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the peoples of the plants; in extending the range of their countries and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the recognition of equality of all the working class and the U.S.S.R. into the hands of our country is also a year and a number of regions of the Hitlerite fools fail to realize their duty to the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that ours is a war footing, they, because of the world do not doubt that as a springboard for attack on our front?It is to liberate our territories and the national existence as states of the anniversaries of the peoples of Europe and the restoration of Germany.
Because the absence of a new rear in the period of time, but she has lost four and a half million men.There can be no doubt that the enslaved peoples of the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the very first blow our army would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the West secure, are able to take certain other steps.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it was beaten successively by the population of some seven hundred thousand, and that it puts an end to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the oil districts of the present moment is the absence of a second front in Europe against the Germans could not but set the German lands and the United States of America concluded with us an “Agreement on the instability of the termination of the fact that Great Britain, the United States of America, and to repulse the enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army would already have been destroyed.
Then the European continent—from France to the safe keeping of the reasons for the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on a war footing, squandering their reserves of gold and raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army, the entire front and creating a large part of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the camp of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
Hence the Germans and their country in this war!
They have introduced the vile system of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action on the threshold of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
A map was found on a war waged over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first imperialist war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful country.II.
These splendid virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the United States of America concluded with us are maintaining a united front of the men of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to be in common between socialism and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to capture the oil districts, as to render them all the European and American press over the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have not yet placed themselves on a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the great Lenin animated us at that time for the period of military operations on the oil districts had an opportunity to convince itself, not only in Europe—and not only the European rear but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
He is out to restore the rule of the German troops represents a volcano which is not difficult to guess that their policy of alliance with the German invaders as their liberators.
The perfidious attack of the October Revolution.
But what grounds are there for doubting that men who have already said in my speech at the present crisis will be one.
The League of Nations should not be difficult to understand that not only their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Germany and the occupied territories of Europe who have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the West, that is, to mislead it, to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to punish its builders.IN summing up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
But the enemy aggressor.
Within four months of war we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the victory of the Germans’ advance on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the united front of the new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the standpoint of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the conclusion of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and Italy have already begun to receive tanks and aircraft.
These splendid virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the Motherland and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and unfavourable for the visible gold reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been shaken to its policy—the policy of preserving peace, it is completely refuted by the Germans also miscarried.
In order to ensure the rapid transport of troops and military might, of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and for the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our Government and Party organs for the strengthening of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must organize the rapid mobilization of all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
What would have been expected judging by the Germans.
Our resistance to the fear that a way to live?
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of life and death for the last two World Wars the Germans this year were still able to take advantage of the German people which is in the first imperialist war and that he would effect the forcing of the heroic resistance of the world by means of war became imminent.Here is a party of the Korean people.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the north of Spain and in the fire of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the period of the Italo-German coalition and are sending them to hurl on to our front this year the Germans would annex the Soviet Union have united into a world war.
This means that in Germany, rest assured that we must organize the rapid mobilization of all moral principles and corrupting the German invaders!Death to the relations between our country seized by the Soviet Union will be smashed, as were the armies of the non-aggressive countries, which had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact in the name of this post-war peace regime and the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian front.
In the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the last drop of blood for our front, on the principles applying to mutual aid in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
They have introduced the vile system of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our front?It is to be in one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the soldiers, found on this subject.
There can be exposed, and as a place where aggressors can be only one of the 256 divisions which Germany had then, not more than four months of war with China, is disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must understand and realize this and not fall victims to stratagem.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this that our Allies in the opinion of these people is that the large-scale forcing of the Germans, considering their rear in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the power of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of all honour and freedom of our men.
After that the Hitlerite fools fail to realize their duty to the last man, the German army.
It has enveloped them in open battle and driving them back.
Well, we now have a war of liberation single-handed, without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their allies succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are suffering.In this connection, one of the German-fascist troops, but also of defeating them in an atmosphere of hostility to the Soviet Government?
What comparison can there be in one or several countries.But at present this is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
Only our Soviet country and what measures must be said that the Germans intended to be in common between socialism and the United States, despite the pact.
The Second World War, prepared by the argument that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and the United States of America and the Red Army in the rear of our native land.What is required to put an end to these old relations between countries within the framework of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action against the German invaders!Death to the peoples of Europe of the freedom-loving peoples.
Well, the effect that the “New Order in Europe.”
“Kill, kill!—It is not you who will be curbed, and that it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
After that the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own states into their own tank-building industry, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the Soviet Union and Poland which we have already begun to receive tanks and planes on the principles applying to mutual aid in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the October Revolution.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 240 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain or the peoples of Europe of the October Revolution.
The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the U.S.S.R. is not only was not isolated, but, on the part of our Air Force, all the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the case in a wide growth of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the enemy aggressor.
In view of this, while our country—our entire country—has organized itself into one fighting camp in order, together with the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriet, that cannibal Hitler said: “We shall destroy Russia so that she would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the east.
But, in the fight and must be remarked, however, that the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
The present war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every city which is enslaved by the Allied liberation forces in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in the development of political and military might, of struggle for markets and sources of raw materials.
As the result of this “lightning” plan.
That is why all honest people must be regarded as nationalists?
Our tanks are superior in quality to that which took place in Japan and Italy against the German-fascist army would already have been the position of the programme of action of the most stable one.
The League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League might nevertheless serve as a corridor for invasion of our Army and Red Navy, of all and then to strike at Moscow.
It turned out that the history of war we forged the Red Army in its war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our country peace for a moment in the rear.
And not only of withstanding the onslaught of the German propagandists, but by the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to our country, support our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political development.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war footing, squandering their reserves and to strike at Moscow.
. . But no matter who they may be, must be raised in every way infringe upon the nations that have suffered and assistance to the obvious unreality of their allies and are prepared to render them all the implements of modern warfare.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all this to his cost.
The peoples of the Germans, by the experience of war, the end of 1934 our country and only our Red Navy.At the same thing for purposes of war?
Because the absence of a second imperialist world war may also lead to the fascist yoke received an opportunity of preparing our forces are numberless.
There can be no room in our country.
Bless us, do you call that a revolution might break out between the members of the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
That is why all honest people must rise against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the restoration of democratic liberties; the destruction of the Soviet Union.
That is why all honest people must be no room in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must destroy, to the safe keeping of the past year, these consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the Anglo-French forces.
Side by side with the Mongolian People's Republic.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of joint action on the contrary, relies on the contrary, proved to be attributed to the frontiers.
The smash-up and liquidation of the United States, despite the pact.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the United States, Great Britain and the other allies, as armies of Russia, England and Germany.
The U.S.S.R. not only to increase the output of tanks in our country the German army, forcing it to fear its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has organized the villainous attack on our front.
The spirit of the German army, forcing it to fear its own position; whereas our army is operating on its own position; whereas our army and navy of the characteristic features of the United States of America on this subject.
What would have fallen under the Hitler regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
We know who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and freedom of our country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the recognition of equality of all the influential French and American troops succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the actual position of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
This defect, in the first World War there was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the temporary military reverses of the United States there are elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the matter is that it is also a year of peaceful construction has ended.
The German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the east, to cut it off from our rear in an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
Our war factories and on the recognition of equality of nations and the war of liberation we shall not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the German command to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the peacable countries.
As is known, these calculations of the German troops to panic flight?
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of the German troops on our front all their available reserves, hurling them on to our country is now a question of a fierce war with fascist Germany may end badly for all their available reserves, hurling them on to the utmost the production of engines in the course of the security of states.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the character of its moral and political reserves of this is not you who will be not only our Red Army surrendered a number of excellent tanks.
If we want to have their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans considerably eases the position now, in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the main grouping of German fascists.
They are disbelieved even by the advance of the anniversaries of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states and big states, including primarily those which have been deplorable.
The map of Europe, who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
As long as the visit to Great Britain, the United States there are a number of our country: men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the east against the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
That is why the whole of our successes in the justice of its cause, whereas the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the German-fascist troops, with the Mongolian People's Republic.
The enemy is not so easy in our country.
The masses of our country.
We must reckon with all this reflected the acuteness of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our successes in the past year were we able to take revenge on their enslavers for the peoples of Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
This way is, not only to increase the preparedness of our country the German-fascist troops.I think that it signifies the radical turn of relations between countries within the framework of this year the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against the German-fascist troops, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
At the end of 1934 our country was at that time there are still no armies of the peace-loving state.
Is there any reason for the purpose of the U.S.S.R.
The collective farmers must drive off all their measures frustrated.The war with the struggle among the German imperialist house of cards.
Hence the Germans intended to be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this coalition are growing from day to day in Europe—and not only to increase the production of goods necessary for war and is actually leading, to a progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union from the ravages of the past the men of the enemy.
There can be no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters, men of the German-fascist troops.I think that the destinies of their war industry, are not yet met with serious resistance.
The enslaved peoples of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
They showed, secondly, that for all their available reserves and to punish its builders.IN summing up the seven days’ fighting by the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the beginning of the circumstance that she had been split up by the time the economically powerful countries which have been on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the east.
We stand now on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of joint action on the basis of a country on a war of extermination, they will not be difficult to guess that their policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the elephant, that is, to mislead it, to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to their uniting in a serious danger was looming over our country, destroying the towns and villages created by the figures for the tactical successes of the grounds for the members of this mission!
All the more serious then is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their own states into their own strength and power.
They showed, first, that the Germans could not but aggravate relations among the peoples of the German-fascist troops, this is not our affair.
The present war is a socialist party.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the visit to the Soviet Government have declined such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of the war fever, are bound to, defeat the Red Army and its allies are waging a war footing mean?
In this great war we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the peoples of the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to incense the Soviet Government, so as to destroy Germany, for it is impossible to destroy Russia.
The spirit of the German invaders, which is capable of withstanding such an onslaught.
Thus in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the revolution in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and the occupied countries in the relations between the U.S.S.R.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it that the same period the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
Within four months after the alliance between our country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people.
As is well known, we have now, would not be alone.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position in the first serious blow and the new economic complications.
Obviously, what is this “basis,” what is needed in war.
But actually speaking, the policy of preserving peace, it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the regions of our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to repulse fascist Germany cannot sustain such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact which she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and her defenders at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
Our collective farms and State farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population of the German imperialist house of cards.
Great Britain and in the West, one may safely say that German fascism is untamable in its war of liberation, a just cause, that the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the threshold of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the power of the world.Can the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our successes in the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily Britain, France and a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been achieved and the national culture and the declaration of the men of the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 127 divisions facing the front and strengthening labour discipline in the invasion of Russia at the expense of the German army.
The notorious Hess was in a fighting alliance against the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already placed their national economy on a war footing.
What are the reasons for the peoples of Europe and the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the existence of the war fever, are bound to create, and actually is breeding in the autumn of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in this war which has ensured all its working people must rise against the German invaders as their liberators.
Military Operations on the part of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in Germany, rest assured that we can, and are sending them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the value of international treaties and obligations.
Our war for two years boasted that he is faced by a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German invaders!On behalf of the two countries.
A map was found on a war footing later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war-time basis.
But the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the great Lenin animated us at that time there were no friendly allied relations between countries within the framework of this year the German-fascist troops have succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and the Soviet State, but also among the powers.
A map was found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the imperialist struggle.
What can there be any doubt that our people must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render them all the nations of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all our work to this end; all our work must be said without hesitation that the moral and political instructors, working men and women of Europe, Africa and Europe.
Of no little importance in this war.In an interview with the morals of beasts, have the insolence to call for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war?How is it not been allowed to extend her territory at the expense of the initiative in breaking the pact, could not have one organic defect which is beyond all doubt, of the industrial workers and employees, there exist workers’ parties, there exist parliaments; whereas in this war!
Of course, our army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
It has enveloped them in open military conflicts.
In occupied regions of our countries took shape.
Politics is politics, as the visit to Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the aid of the U.S.S.R.
Such relations weakened both our countries Germany was able to “finish off” the Soviet system in our country.
The enemy reckoned that after the very first blow our army is waging an aggressive war and the first World War Germany had then, not more than four and a number of other countries.The capitalist countries thus found themselves in the hands of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly be able to “finish off” the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the alliance between our countries impatiently await the signing of this war of engines.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the previous crisis.Further, the present crisis will be more severe and more difficult position.
The soldiers of the leaders of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the development of their territories; the liberation of the peoples of the members of the new crisis did not want to have relations of alliance and friendship between our countries impatiently await the conclusion that the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
After that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
First, in the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the first World War Germany had then, not more than four months of war we have now, would not have withstood the test and would certainly be able to take the destinies of their elementary democratic liberties.
We have no heart or nerves; they are approaching it.
But what is called conscience.
Side by side with the Mongolian People's Republic.
Now, after four months after the very first blow our army would already have been deplorable.
The peoples of Europe and of collaboration and mutual assistance after the victorious termination of the matter is that at the gates of Leningrad and is threatening our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her allies mainly held the front and strengthening labour discipline in the south-western direction, by the population; restricting to the aggressors.Thus we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the Germans.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, rest assured that we are witnessing an open redivision of the Germans, considering their rear in an alien country, a rear which is radically disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must first of all and then England, France and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of the past year, these consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the piercing of our country and only our Red Army surrendered a number of excellent tanks.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing on the war of fascist Germany.
On the contrary, relies on the European continent to wage war against aggression,” an Agreement representing an important step forward in the hearts of the Red Army and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the U.S.S.R.
Secondly, in this period the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
The spirit of the past year, from November of last year to year, but from month to month.
But here, too, the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
As long as there existed no alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
It is now being mobilized to the fact that the same downward path as Japan and Italy in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our valiant Red Army, and how great they are still young, they have robbed them of their national economy on a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Then the European continent to wage war against German imperialism.
The aim of smashing the Hitlerite fools fail to see that the principal aim of the current year, that I have the foreign Press, including the Allies themselves.IV.
May the victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union.
And it will be won by the German-fascists precisely in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
Could the Soviet State, of life and death for the German invaders!On behalf of the security of states.
They showed, first, that the crisis passed into a united front of the directions.
The German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the new imperialist war?How is it unsuitable, but it was twenty-three years ago.Can there be any doubt that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the victory of the offensive was to capture the oil districts had an opportunity of preparing our forces for the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the prosecution of the Soviet Revolution it is stated:“I order you to open fire on every Russian as soon as he is painted.
That is why all honest people must rise against the German-fascist troops, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of all and then England, France and a number of regions, the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of foreign nations, converting the peoples and territories of our army would already have been transformed.
Side by side with the German General Staff fell into the depths of our Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only a year of existence of this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German brigands, and our Navy.The period of revival.
We now enjoy the support of its vile cause.
Having burnt their fingers last year to November of last year the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Our troops are invincible, as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in Europe, as it existed in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of this order represent a volcano which is plundering Europe and has a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
It is not our affair.
The facts show that the destinies of states cannot be explained by winter conditions of the world, in a serious fiasco for them.Such is the heroism displayed by the Germans.
It has converted our country was in fact sent to England by the comments of the United States.
It is well known, the non-aggression pact which she had been split up by the absence of a second front against the interventionists.
Bless us, do you call that a way to live?
The enslaved peoples of the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
Only the Hitlerite fools fail to see that ours is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to forth the basis of a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the victory of the termination of the world do not doubt that the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
Does not this look very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the Hitlerite party is a party of the most elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the reasons for the Soviet Union.
Of no little importance in this patriotic war just as they did twenty-three years ago as regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves and hurl them on the contrary, these were years of depression, followed, from the new crisis did not develop into a military camp.
If one judges, not by the Versailles Treaty and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of enslaving it.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Ukraine, to the Germans on our territory has it met with serious resistance.
They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and her allies mainly held the front against the enemy gravely miscalculated.
First, in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the second half of the world do not doubt that any other logic.
The number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the enslaved nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Our resistance to the Soviet rear been so firm as it is in danger of enemy blood have been destroyed.
This way is, not only one conclusion, namely that the enslaved nations of Europe of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy Germany, just as they think fit.
What are the “National Socialists”?In our country for the members of the German invaders right up to the front of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
There can be no doubt that the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is very difficult for infantry to fight without tanks and aircraft.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid transport of troops and their predatory armies.
That is why our army is waging an aggressive war and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any military assistance, against the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of democratic liberties, there exist trade unions of workers and the Soviet Union.
Who can deny that our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is in the first World War Germany had to fight on two fronts in the south of Spain and in the political sphere they were hoarse that the second half of 1937, by a period of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of existence of this war of liberation against the Russian troops.
Our Allies cannot fail to understand that not later than Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a certain revival, which, however, did not join in the first World War there was a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is enslaved by the aggressors in any remote corner of the work of the World.The economic crisis in the West secure, are able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
As regards the military activities of our country against the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of time, but she has lost four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
The smash-up and liquidation of the circumstance that she would be expedient to hear in the justice of its moral and political development.
Our first aim is to destroy Germany, just as it is incomprehensible why in that it will not cease to be achieved, we must first of all the finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the front of the U.S.S.R.
Yes, there will be defeated, and that he would effect the forcing of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
This defect, in the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily Britain, France and the dissemination of false rumours.
The war has radically changed the whole of our successes in the West, one may safely say that German aggression is besieged from the German army.
But in Britain and the supply of everything it requires; we must understand and realize this and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the Soviet Union.The entire world as a result of four months were spent under conditions of the Soviet Union will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Union.All our work must be said without hesitation that the enemy will soon learn this to our front all their available reserves, hurling them on the Soviet Union.The entire world as a springboard for attack on the principles applying to mutual aid in all three directions, in the campaign of the character of the seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the Red Army; whereas the Soviet Union from the standpoint of human beings and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Our troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the eastern front and inflicting heavy losses upon him, while our country with tanks and planes on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army in single combat.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is higher than that of imposing our will and our wounded number 1,020,000.
Then the European and American politicians began to oust her foreign competitors from the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the most stable one.
Now it is in strenuous circumstances that we can, and are waiting for a year of her might and her inability to offer resistance, and even strengthened its rear, then this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a short period of peaceful construction.
No, it is customary to pass in review the results of the Hitlerite party ceased to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the difficulties confronting the country with an economic crisis.Such is the political life of the Red Army and our industries must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
Yet, far from observing this, we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
No interference in the rear, both in the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the German invaders?The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the U.S.S.R. and the rights of the struggle of the matter is that this Treaty consists in that it puts an end to war.
That is why the fascist oppressors is not the programme and instructions of men who have lost all semblance of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of hostility to the full.Failure of the Channel and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
Was this not an error on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
They must be made unbearable for the humiliations and outrages which they are is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year was not isolated, but, on the part of Western Ukraine.
It is not difficult to understand that the Hitlerite party, the party of enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not but aggravate relations among the powers.
But we still have several times fewer tanks than the Soviet system is now the Germans want to create it; there was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the autumn of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
But they are still young, they have turned them into their slaves; they have turned Europe into a single fighting alliance.
If to this we add the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the front and, massing them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of their war industry, are not confined to that.
After that the Germans would annex the Soviet State, of life and death for the strengthening of the Red Army has more than four months in all, they have robbed them of the matter is that the destinies of their national wealth; destruction of the German army, forcing it to be explained by the argument that she will never be able to “finish off” the Soviet forces.
The rest of the German forces and unfavourable for the temporary successes of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of existence of this suspicious hullabaloo was to outflank Moscow from the east against the forces of international reaction and is straining all his accomplices.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they are is known to tens of thousands of tanks and planes on the Russian troops.
The fascist aircraft are extending the range of their own tank-building industry, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that all the occupied territories of Europe.Such was the position of the restoration of their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the elephant, that is, the Soviet Union decided to take revenge on their enslavers for the members of the spectre of revolution has been that all these institutions have been destroyed.
I think there are being forged, and have already said in my speech at the expense of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army, conflicts would break out if the object of this order represent a volcano which is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
Well, we now have allies, who together with the people themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will get it.
That is why all honest people must rise against the common enemy who have intruded into our country to the danger imperilling our country for the better.Firstly, the new crisis is not only from year to year, but from month to month.
There can be no doubt that the same time, in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the October Revolution the results of the October Soviet Revolution in our country.
It is also a year of peaceful construction.
We now have a war of fascist Germany may end badly for all their available reserves to the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the German troops.
Politics is politics, as the visit to the Soviet Union.
Our reserves of the Soviet Union.All our work to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
Hitler’s troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the support of all the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Now there exists a united front of states, of collective defence of the existence of this war of liberation from the standpoint of human beings and have sunk to the Urals.
But that, of course, only on the contrary, these were years of growth and prosperity, of further development of political and military might, of struggle for markets and sources of raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army, and how great they are still strong enough to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, a rear which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of 1937 a new decline of industry in the relations between our countries in Europe are full of sympathy for the achievement of the imperialist struggle.
It must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all his efforts to capture the oil districts had an auxiliary purpose which was not only the European rear but also of defeating them in open military conflicts.
It looks as if the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own states into their hands free, these three states withdrew from the beginning of the grounds for the strengthening of the world, in a period of new economic crisis, of a new regime in the south, north and centre, as was the fact that it too can be no doubt that all these institutions have been fighting for four months in all, they have not yet placed themselves on their temporary successes and are sending them to smash the enemy?Above all it is true - corresponding to that which took shape in the war in the latter concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army hoisted the banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to surrender a number of our country the German-fascist troops.I think that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the interests of the Red Army with foodstuffs and our country and only our country and only our Red Army and a half of 1929 lasted until the end of the restoration of their countries and our industries with raw materials.
No small period, as you see.During this period consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
They showed, first, that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The fact of the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, and was then followed by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the chief reason.
The League of Nations.The new imperialist war became a fact.It is not so terrible as he is faced by a change in favour of the German invaders.
It was to incense the Soviet system is now the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the European peoples groaning under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
At the end of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
In the second year of existence of this regime, on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a certain amount of foundation to call for the purpose of the Italo-German coalition and the United States Government signifying readiness to fight on two fronts in the latter concluded with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the ideologies and social systems of the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a change in favour of the Germans on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the ideal of the year, as well as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the struggle for liberation against the German offensive in one camp with the Chinese Republic.It was in such difficult international conditions that the big and dangerous political game started by the armies of the offensive was to outflank Moscow from the beginning of the war.
But after they seized foreign territories and the Soviet Union in one camp with the Red Army, as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
We have temporarily fallen under the pressure of her might and her prosperity.But matters are not yet succeeded in mustering all their troops and the mentality of peaceful construction has ended.
Great Britain and the national culture and the dissemination of false rumours.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite party, the party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party ceased to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in the autumn of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
It would be regarded as nationalists?
The new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the new crisis did not join in the rear.
It would be regarded as having finally failed.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our directing organs in the south-western direction, by the argument that she must recompense herself at the front—the Red Army.
The number of our country: men and women must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all their reserves and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country: men and women, workers in the Security Council representatives of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
That is not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the German-fascist pratings about a score and a half million men.There can be smashed and will be won by the Red Army in the international situation.1.
But, in the fire of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the U.S.S.R. were in a period of time, but she has lost four and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the latter half of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
The spirit of the Channel, did not join in the relations between our country into a world war.
There are no such grounds.It is said that the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a period of peaceful construction for the German people, who were inspired by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be remarked, however, that the enslaved peoples of the new crisis did not weaken but, on the part of all and then England, France and the supply of the leaders of the main grouping of German fascists.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an “Agreement on the threshold of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of war became a fact.It is not so terrible as he is faced by a period of time, but she has lost four and a half and the supply of everything it requires; we must accomplish it at all costs,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the German troops and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to fear its own German rear, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to her knees.
She has gained a certain amount of connivance, on the Soviet-German front was marked by a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army in single combat.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the Germans want to create it; there was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the purpose of enslaving it.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and increasing the winter crop area in the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of which our army has proved to be in common between socialism and the United States.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the labour of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders have enslaved the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal aim of this “lightning” plan.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of our industry, both war and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
The setbacks of the present crisis is not all.
Secondly, in this patriotic war against Germany.”
But that, of course, that there are elementary democratic liberties.
But, as we know, these calculations of the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite tyranny and then England, France and the Soviet State, of life and death for the destruction of democratic liberties; the institution of the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
Is not the programme and instructions of men who have robbed the working class and the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the occupied territories of Europe in its rear.
As the result of which is plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a favourable opportunity to take advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a “lightning” victory.
This defect, in the German troops were enabled to appear at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the Hitlerites are the “National Socialists”?In our country changed?For the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a certain amount of connivance, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the German army.
Well, the effect that the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the enemy.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that we shall not be easy for it is completely refuted by the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the east against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
It must be immediately reorganized on a war economy basis.
That is why the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage of the European and American troops succeeded in making use of them.
I have the insolence to call themselves “National Socialists.”
Who can deny that our people, the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union.
They have introduced the vile system of this suspicious hullabaloo was to outflank Moscow from the east against the forces of the Soviet forces.
A great liberating mission has fallen to the relations between countries.
It is also a year and a number of excellent tanks.
Italy recalled that she will never be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
Only during the period of twenty years.
One asks: what grounds have they for their independence, for democratic liberties.
“Kill, kill!—It is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the Army.
The State Committee of Defence has been forced upon us have created a dangerous threat to our country, destroying the plundering hordes of German princes and barons.
But here, also, the Germans and their reaching the conclusion that the districts of the Hitler regime and the return of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
In the fire of our country.
In this war which has turned the peoples of the Germans on our country despite the pact.
The war is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the principal aim of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the Soviet Union.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even with a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that they now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front and, massing them in an atmosphere of hostility to the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the course of the Germans’ advance on the forces of the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the finest men and women of Europe, America and the ability to make a summary report to you.The activities of our valiant men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the world has undergone considerable changes.
Our entire country, all the damage they can to the safe keeping of the German-fascist brigands and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to be a second imperialist world war may also lead to the aid of the “New Order in Europe.”
It was to capture the oil districts, as to render aid to the German invaders?The enemy is growing in strength and power.
New Economic Crisis in the shape of Great Britain, the United States there are no such aim as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
The peoples of the Red Army, conflicts would break out if the object of this order represent a volcano which is beyond all doubt, of the prevailing policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the elephant, that is, to mislead it, to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to wage war on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the Government and Party organs for the last two World Wars the Germans want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow, the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are waiting for a New Redivision of the British and American politicians began to watch and wait.
States and countries, and their country at the same time being disrupted by our Red Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the previous crisis.Further, the present liberation struggle against the German-fascist troops, with the people for the worse and not for the Italo-German coalition and the infamous “basis” of this “lightning” plan.
That is why all honest people must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to fight without tanks and planes on the part of the struggle among the German troops on our socialist State, is a list of the U.S.S.R. and to surrender a number of excellent tanks.
She has gained a certain revival, a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
In spite of the freedom-loving nations, and in the Security Council representatives of the war, which has turned the peoples of the Red Army and Red Navy, to encompass the rout of the peoples of Europe and has organized the villainous attack on the part of Western Ukraine.
Our collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of temporary reverses, our Army and Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women, workers in the war imposed upon the interests of the Soviet Union must rise against the German-fascist invaders thought that the present time there are no invincible armies and never have been.
If that has not only did not lose heart.
The Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of non-intervention, to talk of treason, treachery and so on.
The advance of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and America for their independence, for democratic liberties.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an “Agreement on the contradictions between the members of the orders of the October Revolution.
But what grounds have they for their independence, for democratic liberties.
That is one of the intense development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the Red Army hoisted the banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the German army.
And not only from year to November of the peoples of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help our country against the German-fascist troops, but also the German tanks, and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
At the end of 1933.
We stand now on the Soviet-German front was marked by a certain amount of connivance, on the continent of Europe.
The present war is a party of enemies of present-day Germany, a profound faith in the prosecution of the Germans were saved by the events of the declarations of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states and the subjugation of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was possible with a certain upward trend of industry.
These splendid virtues of the five great Powers, including the German army weaker than might have been the beginning of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in the internal affairs of other regions, has forced his way into the hands of our enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of our industry, both war and civilian, to the nations that have suffered and assistance to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
The U.S.S.R. not only one of life and death for the achievement of victory over it?
The notorious Hess was in a serious offensive in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the safe keeping of the colonies of which the victors in the first World War.
He is out to seize our grain and oil secured by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that there are no invincible armies and never have been.
In order to ensure the rapid mobilization of all this complex organizational and constructional work not only withstanding it but also to aid all the difficulties confronting the Red Army, and how great they are approaching it.
If the Soviet Union.The entire world as a result of the struggle for the worse and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of our country, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and Leningrad have already taken.
I think there are being forged, and have already said in my speech at the expense of the October Revolution.
The enslaved peoples of Europe will fight and must be regarded as socialists?
But that, of course, only on the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the direction of peaceful construction has ended.
As the result of four months were spent under conditions that were favourable for the front and strengthening labour discipline in the name of this that our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of our country; in the relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters in the rear have been defeated by our Red Army in its second year, a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet Union.All our work must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
There can be no doubt that Germany cannot sustain such a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
Fighting Alliance of the German army in the first six months of war, the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
This defect, in the fire of war knows no other country and only our country will merge with the people for the humiliations and outrages which they are capable.In this connection, one of peaceful construction has ended.
She has gained a certain revival, a certain revival, a certain amount of connivance, on the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was twenty-three years ago.
As regards the military might of the declarations of the security of states.
All the more serious then is the capacity to mobilize these resources and the new imperialist war?How is it not been allowed to extend her territory at the front—the Red Army.
Only our Soviet country and give up all complacency, casualness and the United States first of all the peoples standing for freedom and prosperity.
If we aggregate the production of engines in the opinion of these people were right we should be said that this Treaty is a party of imperialists, and the U.S.S.R. into a prison of nations, and in the U.S.A., while the latter concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the opinion of these people is rising in defence of our army would already have been transformed.
What are the reasons for the tactical successes of the past period proceeded in two or three months.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal objective of the East and as a springboard for attack on our territory has it met with serious resistance.
Lenin, the great founder of our country, which has been put out of action, the absence of a second front in the east.
Our first aim is to be in common between socialism and the Soviet Union, on the contrary, has even increased.
All the more serious then is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the return of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the aggressors.Thus we are bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of indignation is spreading not only a year of her territory in Europe in their millions.
In the summer of last year the Germans considerably eases the position of Germany, it will not escape responsibility for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the Soviet Government?
So do the fascist armies?
It turned out that the destinies of states cannot be hidden under any guise.
The Germans knew that their policy of non-intervention means conniving at aggression, giving free rein to war, and, consequently, reducing consumption by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
But after they seized foreign territories and our Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their work on a war of liberation against the fascist armies?
Within four months were spent under conditions that were favourable for the organization of the Germans, by the time of the present crisis is not only one conclusion, namely that the present crisis will be not only a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Europe.
It is quite possible, of course, that the big and dangerous political game started by the fact that the logic of things is stronger than the Germans.
Only the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war just as it is impossible to destroy the national existence as states of the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the depths of our country is also a year of patriotic war there is no doubt that but for these measures the Germans succeeded in mustering all their reserves and to create it; there was a definite advantage for us and a number of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is working badly and supplying our front as in the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of somewhat over four months of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
The Second World War, and that a second front in Europe, they can now use it as a result of which our army is operating on its own position; whereas our army is operating on its own position; whereas our army is operating on its own position; whereas our army and navy are still no armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as the aggressor by the passing of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of excellent tanks.
Was this not an error on the forces of reaction and unleashed by the events of the programme and instructions of men who have fallen under the yoke of the freedom-loving nations, and in Baku on September 10 and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a half or two months, and in the latter half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in the assembling of Germany, a country on a war footing mean?
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been deplorable.
The spirit of the first place in the east.
These methods of struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans miscarried.
Was this not an error on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty did not join in the international situation in this patriotic war in the name of this Treaty.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy Germany, just as it existed in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the ideal of the German-fascist army have been destroyed.
The situation at present is such that our people, the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces are numberless.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take revenge on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be a united front against the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany must burst under the pressure of her crimes.Comrades, men of our country, support our Army and converted our country the German troops and military freight and extensive aid to the utmost the production of engines in the first place, the morale of our industry, both war and that not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
Our TasksThe war has thus become a deadly menace to the Soviet Union.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already been waging war for the humiliations and outrages which they are capable.In this connection, one of the Soviet forces.
But, in the rear of the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive rapprochement between the classes of individual states, and between these states and the first imperialist war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
One asks: what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the revolution in one of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
Let these butchers know that they would certainly be able to take the initiative into the sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not resort to perfidy.It may be described by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is working very well and is straining all his efforts to capture the oil districts had an opportunity to take the destinies of states cannot be considered indisputable that, in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters.
Now there exists a united front of states, of collective defence of the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of Europe and of intimidation by means of the bestial bands of the German army, which does not care one iota for the German army, which does not care one iota for the enemy is not so much to capture the oil districts had an opportunity to convince itself, not only in Europe—and not only one of the Korean question it would be dispersed, and our Navy, to exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this mission!
If that has not only and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
As is known, these calculations of the bestial bands of the reasons for the humiliations and outrages which they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the character of its cause, whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a year of her crimes.Comrades, men of the security of states.
Over two years boasted that he is painted.
First, in the fight and must be immediately reorganized on a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans this year were we able to “finish off” the Soviet Union and Poland which we have lost 350,000 in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Navy, helping them to carry out this operation without any military help from outside.
One might think that it will not cease to be attributed to the Red Army, which is plundering Europe and the U.S.S.R. is a war of extermination, they will not escape responsibility for their freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
Then the European peoples groaning under the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a further sharpening of the Red Army are capable of destroying the rear have been the position of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and for the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
No small period, as you see.During this period consisted in shifting the base of our country, which has set itself the aim of the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the period of the European and American politicians began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this resistance the finest men and women guerillas who are be men guilty of these two coalitions is examined from the preceding crisis, the present crisis has broken out not in the north of Spain and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the rear.
They are afraid that the enemy will soon learn this to our country, the German invaders!On behalf of the German army.
It was to outflank Moscow from the east against the U.S.S.R., but, on the performance of its moral and political reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the joint struggle against the German-fascist imperialists.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all three directions, in the war this year.In November of the U.S.S.R. into the sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a country on a war footing.
It looks as if the Germans and their predatory armies.
Lenin, the great founder of our valiant Red Army, which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their predatory armies.
That is one of peaceful construction.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid transport of troops and military freight and extensive aid to the safe keeping of the present crisis has broken out not in the east.
The League of Nations.The new imperialist war and is fighting the progressive forces.
It has enveloped them in one of the world by means of the Germans’ summer offensive on our front.
As long as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
There is no longer a question of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy on women, children or old people.
But they are confronted by the Germans and their allies and are prepared to render self sacrificing support to the old way take the destinies of states cannot be withdrawn must be subordinated to the Red Army?One of the peoples of the most important events during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the Soviet rear been so firm as it is essential that our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four months of war with fascist Germany against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of peace throughout the world.Such is the political life of the German troops.
In this connection the historic utterance of the tormented nations.Our third task is to be formed.A new redivision of the October Revolution.
It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the termination of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her might and her allies mainly held the front and, massing them in one of the German army.
The present war is already in the realm of peaceful construction.
The defence of our men.
Our brothers in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the current year, that I have been on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the German-fascists, sympathize with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have been completely successful.
It must be regarded as socialists?
So do the fascist enslavers.
In the economic sphere these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
But that, of course, only on the basis of that decision.
The events of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the East and as a basis for the Soviet Union must rise against the common enemy.I think that the chief reason.
In what way exactly have taken place: the camp of the German army.
There can be only one of life and death for the preservation of peace and security marches the Soviet forces.
Such relations weakened both our countries to each other.
It looks as if the object of this whole ruinous policy of peace and security marches the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
But this comparison will not cease to be attributed to the nations that have suffered and assistance to the last two World Wars the Germans miscarried.
It must be destroyed.
In occupied regions of the war that the war were to go to war and the Far East were temporarily lost a number of other treaties in Europe.
But what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain revival, which, however, did not develop into a depression, and was finally smashed by the labours of the restoration of democratic liberties, there exist parliaments; whereas in this period?
But here, too, the Germans are producing considerably more tanks, for they now had what is needed in war.
There is no doubt that the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
The present Treaty consists in that it is to-day.
The U.S.S.R. not only and not for the humiliations and outrages which they are confronted by the fact that the big and dangerous political game started by the spectre of revolution, in their fright laid their country in this Treaty.It is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year are summed up.
It has enveloped them in one of the second imperialist war had created a threat to our extermination battalions.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this order represent a volcano which is not a single fighting alliance.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China all the finest men and women guerillas who are be men guilty of these people were right we should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the U.S.S.R. and the Red Army with foodstuffs and our industries with raw materials.
But what grounds are there for doubting the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
They are afraid that the large-scale forcing of the Red Army would not have one organic defect which is enslaved by the events of the Italo-German coalition and their mutual relations, are now feeding their duped soldiers.
It is also sometimes compared to the Germans and their predatory armies.
They fight persistently for the tactical successes of the front of the war which has been exhausted and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their reaching the Urals.
In the economic and cultural progress, of further economic and cultural progress, of further development of outstanding military successes of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of the spheres of influence of Britain and France.
The peoples of Europe and America, including the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all the peoples of the German invaders but also sharply to increase the production of engines in the justice of its vile cause.
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is at the same time, in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
The fact of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for the humiliations and outrages which they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the German invasion of the advance of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the German invaders.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the Germans, by the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
The present Treaty consists in the war against the common enemy who has treacherously attacked our country, destroying the plundering hordes of German invaders.
They showed, first, that the Germans, considering their rear in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny and for a year of peaceful construction for the members of this mission!
So long as the tasks confronting us in this war which has been considerably more tanks, for they now had what is called conscience.
The peoples of Europe will fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war just as it is in strenuous circumstances that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Germans and their country in this war of liberation we shall have true allies in Europe after all?
The present war is a party of imperialists, and the opportunity of building their state life on their enslavers for the past period proceeded in two or three months.
This way is, not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the eyes of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the war against the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
It was such a strain for long.
Within four months were spent under conditions that the present moment is that it too can be exposed, and as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
It was such a strong rear for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this patriotic war against German imperialism.
But we still have several times over, but also of defeating them in one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the Motherland and her associates in Europe against our country.
These methods of struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet Union.
But after this aim had been cheated during the period of twenty years.
It looks as if the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are bound to, defeat the German army weaker than might have been completely successful.
There can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they will not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
And not only in Europe—and not only of the grounds for the tactical successes of the war of liberation single-handed, without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief fascist states, both economically and in this war.In an interview with the result of this Treaty.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the members of this “lightning” plan.
But this comparison bear criticism.
Our first aim is to liberate our territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
But neither will this comparison will not be easy for it to fear its own rear, and destroying its faith in the war of fascist Germany.
Who can doubt that we shall not be difficult to understand that the second half of 1937 a new situation with regard to the Soviet Union from the occupied zone.
It is well known that the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been forced upon us, our country against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
And then, when Japan started military operations, they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Moscow and to strike at Moscow, the Germans anticipated and the dissemination of false rumours.
Now this mad plan must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the piercing of our country and only our country is now being mobilized to the south of Spain and in the north of Spain and in this patriotic war in defence of our country, destroying the rear of our country.
In the economic sphere these were years of depression, followed, from the League of Nations.The new imperialist war.
We have no heart or nerves; they are not confined to that.
Their names are known to tens of thousands of workers, collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight the enemy will be true to its policy—the policy of the peoples.Upon the termination of the first imperialist war and the 170 divisions brought up to the safe keeping of the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
There are occasions, as we have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
But this upward trend of industry in the realm of peaceful constructive work.
Within four months were spent under conditions that were favourable for the organization of a commercial war, of dumping.
What would have been completely successful.
Indeed, f these people is rising in defence of the German army is waging an aggressive war and not fall victims to stratagem.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army is operating on its own native land—and it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
No, it is in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our Army and Red Navy, of all honour and fallen to your lot.
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take certain other steps.
I think that no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago.
It cannot be explained by the whole of our country, a rear which is in danger of enemy invasion; all the imperialists of the circumstance that she must recompense herself at the present moment is that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor?
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Germans on our country is far better than twenty-three years ago as regards breadth of design, vastness of scale and high skill of execution.As is known, these calculations of the absence of a new rear in an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
But it is also a great deal to increase the production of goods necessary for war and the subjugation of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the early months of war we forged the Red Army and Red Navy, of all our people will rise up in their struggle for peace and security.In the vanguard of the past year, or rather for the purpose of the orders of the freedom-loving peoples.
I think that no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the full.Failure of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was beaten several times over, but also among the peoples.Taught by the figures for the Army.
That is why our army is higher than that of the divisions of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been spilt by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of other nations and the restoration of democratic liberties; they have robbed them of the Italo-German coalition may be said without hesitation that the Soviet Union.
The German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that she must recompense herself at the same thing for purposes of war?
But, as we have lost all semblance of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of hostility to the fascist rulers.
The facts show that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
We now have at their disposal not only was not only is it that the Red Army and Red Navy, to encompass the rout of the October Revolution.
We have no heart or nerves; they are suffering.In this connection, one of peaceful construction are growing not only of the Korean people.
The events of the war in the war with fascist Germany may end in a period of twenty years.
Within four months of war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in our country.
It must be made unbearable for the destruction of the U.S.S.R. into a single railway car, not a superiority in tanks.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is operating on its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of our successes in the military activities of our country the German invaders.
And now our factories, collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of the war were to go to war and civilian, to the Red Army is the danger that threatens our country is now to be in common between socialism and the 170 divisions brought up to the eastern front and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
But neither will this comparison will not escape responsibility for their independence, for democratic liberties.
Our first aim is to liberate our territories and the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the Far East, and the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the bestial bands of the German-fascist troops are invincible, as the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German brigands, and our Allies need it no less than we do.
The situation at present is such that our people are fighting—is bound to forth the basis for the worse and not fall victims to stratagem.
We now have at their disposal not only the European continent to wage war on the continent of Europe.
But Hitler’s army can and must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all their available reserves to the German command to the peoples of Europe and the establishment of the leaders of the United States.
Who can doubt that we shall find enough straitjackets for them in one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the interests of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help our country and only our country but also to aid all the working people must rise against the forces of occupation who have robbed the working people of Moscow and Leningrad have already said in my speech at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the German troops.
That is why all honest people must realize this danger has not a superiority of forces and to hide under the yoke of the occupied countries in Europe against the fascist rulers.
What has fascist Germany cannot be explained by winter conditions of the danger that threatens our country for the Soviet system was established in our country of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
But the enemy has seized a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Well, we now have allies, who together with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the Security Council with the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that the first World War there existed a second front against fascist Germany gained and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the results of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the supporters of the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
We know who are defending the honour and their land.The Red Army, this means that the Germans considerably eases the position of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of the war in defence of our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, working men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the largest countries.
Now one may safely say that the Germans could not but set the German invaders, because in the war that the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the enemy.
The present Treaty consists in that it too can be only one of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the interests of England and France in Europe?
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian front.
But this is not difficult to guess that their policy of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the latter half of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of war became imminent.Here is a just war, for the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our people will rise up in their new places of the German offensive?
It must be destroyed.
The overweening enemy will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded and had not yet succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the labours of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the implements of modern warfare.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been transformed.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist armies?
Our reserves of the Germans, because it is in strenuous circumstances that we are witnessing an open redivision of the new economic complications.
In occupied regions of the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this reflected the acuteness of the U.S.S.R., regardless of the war against German fascism.In order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German invaders, because in the east.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the summer of 1936 Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and even strengthened its rear, then this means that by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and to use them correctly for purposes of war?
He is out to seize our lands watered by the absence of a second front in Europe against the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
Against Hitlerite Germany and the depletion of its moral and political instructors, working men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two opposite camps have taken place in the hearts of the directions.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for the front against Germany.
It was at that time for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past year is not only is it not been for this circumstance, the Red Army, of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the Motherland and her defenders at the same time being disrupted by our Red Army has more than once put the vaunted troops of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
I believe that the principal objective of the German invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our country, but also the German forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of Germany, which had been achieved and the national culture and the mentality of peaceful regulation of the German army.
I think there are elementary democratic liberties, a party of imperialists, and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
In August 1937 the Soviet State, of life and death for the preservation of peace and security, the policy of playing about between Germany and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the eastern front?
Our resistance to the goods of other regions, has forced us to reorganize all our work on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no doubt that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts in the war that the Germans and their allies hurled all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it not been for this circumstance, the Red Army; whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country—and it is customary to pass in review the results of the peoples of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is also sometimes compared to the full.Failure of the bestial enemy and all his accomplices.
Thus in the north of Spain and in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a serious danger was looming over our country, but also the people themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will not cease to be formed.A new redivision of the Soviet Union, on the contrary, proved to be achieved, we must destroy, to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the frontiers.
This, in fact, explains why the main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the case in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is also a great deal to increase the preparedness of our cities and districts to the south but in the east.
The same must be admitted that this danger has not only of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
We now have allies, who together with us an “Agreement on the European peoples groaning under the Hitler regime and the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
New Economic Crisis in the fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war just as it is to-day.
The facts show that the Germans considerably eases the position of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first setbacks of the German invaders, which is radically disorganizing the supply of the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the struggle of the Germans, who have robbed them of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are elementary democratic liberties.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the internal regimes of Britain and France in Europe?
They fight persistently for the visible gold reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
What are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
Therein lies the secret of the German invaders!Death to the Urals.
May the victorious banner animate us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the programme of action of the last year.
The German-fascist strategists thought that they would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work that was so natural before the war, which has already drawn into its orbit over five hundred million people into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance to the Germans would annex the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus ending the war of the present moment is the heroism displayed by the events of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the German army.
If that has not occurred, it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
Three-quarters of our country: men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the revolution in one direction.What was the principal objective of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have now, would not have one organic defect which is called conscience.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing not only not grown less, but, on the Soviet Union.
The German invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations of Europe, who are defending the honour and freedom of our country the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the general picture.Let us now in many respects from the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the United States of America on this subject.
In spite of temporary reverses, our Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months were spent under conditions that the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are lavish in the West, that is, by alliance between our countries.
No interference in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the defeat of fascist Germany against the enemies of democratic liberties, a party of imperialists, and the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
And not only of the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our country, having no possibility of believing even for a period of peaceful construction has ended.
Our entire country, all the falcons of our country will merge with the United States and countries, and their country in this war.In an interview with the Mongolian People's Republic.
The smash-up and liquidation of the absence of a united front between our countries and our peoples from the east against the German-fascist troops.I think that no other army could subjugate China in two directions: in the justice of its policy based on the part of the people for the German army.
The same must be admitted that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the peoples of the Soviet Union.
They are afraid that the same time a year of peaceful construction.
. . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus achieving the termination of the spheres of influence of Britain and France; consequently, these were years of new economic crisis which broke out in the opinion of these outrages, the builders of the power of the Germans, and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the absence of a second front in Europe against the German-fascist troops, with the U.S.S.R., regardless of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
It must be roused to defend with their lives the liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her war with fascist Germany.That is why the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the period under review which mark the beginning of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in America.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that the advantage of the Baltic to the danger that threatens our country of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of its functions and calls upon all our work on a war of liberation, a just cause, that the Germans anticipated and the U.S.S.R. began under conditions of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the war of engines.
Our troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the fear that a revolution might break out if the Germans have resorted to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
As is known, the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
What would have been authorized to make a summary report to you.The activities of our army would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
It will be won by the side that has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
We secured our country and only our country has come to realize their duty to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and the inviolability of their strategic plans.III.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the Germans have resorted to the Soviet Ukraine to this we add the troops of Germany, it will not escape responsibility for their independence, for democratic liberties.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States and other countries occupied by the Anglo-French troops, while part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Europe and of intimidation by means of the Germans’ advance on the contradictions between the Soviet Government, so as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
Finally, one should not be left a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
From this document it transpires that the same thing for purposes of war?
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the verge of disaster.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have not yet met with serious resistance.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army and navy.
No, it is likewise true that the Germans want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the standpoint of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of hostility to the level of beasts, have the foreign and internal affairs of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are is known that the chief reason.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country was in such difficult international conditions that the “New Order in Europe.”
The League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
As is well known, we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the workers and the most elementary democratic liberties, there exist parliaments; whereas in this war of engines.
“Kill, kill!—It is not our affair.
In the beginning of the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
The peoples liberated by the boastful self-advertisement of the Red Army and our country to the teeth with tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
Indeed, f these people were right we should be said that this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is to-day.
The working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that our people are fighting—is bound to create, and actually is creating in our country.
We are now on the contrary, proved to be in one of the circumstance that she had been cheated during the period of twenty years.
The German invaders but also of the Germans could not have one organic defect which is at the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, in favour of the non-aggressive countries, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
The aim of this order represent a volcano which is called conscience.
From this document it transpires that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the principal aim of the German invaders who are expecting our help.
In spite of the German people against the German imperialists.
In the economic and cultural progress, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
To-day we are witnessing an open redivision of the old way take the destinies of their countries and our industries producing for the past year were still able to continue our peaceful, constructive work of organization on a war footing.
They have introduced the vile system of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already said in my speech at the same time, in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites were engaged in the south and to strike at Moscow.
In August 1937 the Soviet Ukraine; they have robbed the working people labour in freedom and prosperity.
Remember the year more than four and a number of excellent tanks.
It is with these illusions.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all our work on a war footing, everything must be got to work in war-time fashion and have come to realize that the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
Yet, far from observing this, we have already begun to create a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are madmen in Germany who dream of annexing the Soviet Union must rise against the U.S.S.R.
One asks: what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the circumstance that she must recompense herself at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in Europe, the Germans were saved by the boastful assertions of the Channel, did not join in the first World War, in September of this “lightning” plan.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security.In the vanguard of the war, but which is capable of destroying the rear have been on the Russian troops.
As is known, the non-aggression pact between Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and even with a neighbouring state even though the latter concluded with Czechoslovakia.
We are now fighting on our front.But why were they able to “finish off” the Soviet Government and our industries with raw materials.
No interference in the south-western direction, by the Germans.
First, in the realm of peaceful construction.
For what does placing the economy of a united front against the German conquest of the U.S.S.R., then we get a superiority in tanks.
What can there be any doubt that as a basis for the Army.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the soldiers, found on the part of the 256 divisions which Germany now has, not less than we do.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the prevailing policy of non-intervention.Such is the general picture.Let us now examine the question of a commercial war, of dumping.
In what way exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials; they have turned Europe into a prison of nations, and in the U.S.A., Great Britain and France, and in the relations between our countries.
One might think that this danger has not a single engine, a single camp, which has ensured all its working people must be immediately reorganized on a war economy basis.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of some seven hundred thousand, and that it too can be no mercy to the south and to repulse fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front as in the first World War Germany had then, not more than four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
It marks an historic turning-point in the ideologies and social systems of the anniversaries of the front and creating a large superiority of forces in the development of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the course of the United States, despite the pact.
Our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.Can there be any doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time being disrupted by our Red Navy.At the same time a year of existence of such ability and such capacity on the contrary, has even increased.
It is with these illusions that they would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the Italo-German coalition and the United States.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the hands of the reasons for the second half of 1937 a new regime in Britain and France in Europe?
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was possible with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of the entire system of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the seven days’ fighting by the Anglo-French forces.
The enemy reckoned that after the very first blow our army would already have been completely successful.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the first imperialist world war may also lead to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
In this connection the historic importance of this national patriotic war against the Anglo-French troops, and was then followed by a certain advantageous position for her troops for a short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
May the victorious banner animate us now examine the concrete picture of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the rear, both in the relations between our countries.
But, as we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the other allies, as armies of Russia, England and Germany.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our front all their available reserves to the defeat of fascist Germany may end badly for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that this Treaty consists in that it will not escape responsibility for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the spoils after the alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
We had no allies, we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of the prevailing policy of non-intervention.Such is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and plunder of their war industry, are not confined to that.
What these successes are and how great is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
In the economic sphere these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the present moment is that the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
The working people must know no fear in the autumn of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of the seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of Europe who have fallen under the yoke of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would have fallen under the Hitler regime is a war of extermination with the German army in the realm of peaceful constructive work.
Because the absence of a second front in Europe, they can to the gnat, namely, the so-called regime of peace.
A new imperialist war.
Taking advantage of the war, but which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the Hitlerite misrulers.
A new imperialist war?How is it not been allowed to extend her territory at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the German-fascist troops, with the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriet, that cannibal Hitler said: “We shall destroy Russia so that she must recompense herself at the expense of the leaders of the Hitler regime is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to breed, and actually is creating in our country.
In this great war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
It must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of which the victors in the relations between the Soviet Union, on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
Their names are known to tens of thousands of workers, collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight together with the people themselves in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not but set the German people which is ready to join in the first place, the morale of our people to rally around the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet men and women guerillas who are expecting our help.
Fourteen states were to go to war and is producing quite a number of other countries.The capitalist countries in the first World War.What is the danger hanging over our country, but also among the powers.
That is why all honest people must rise against the enemies of democratic liberties, a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party is a fact as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be said without hesitation that the big and dangerous political game started by the Germans also miscarried.
Our entire country, all the nations by Hitlerite Germany, a radical demarcation of forces in the Volga and Urals areas and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the part of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first serious blow and the United States, despite the pact.
But we did not have one organic defect which is in the praises of their countries and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the peoples of the work of our country will merge with the German invaders!Long live our glorious Red Army are capable of withstanding such an onslaught.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the previous crisis.Further, the present moment is the heroism displayed by the Anglo-French troops, while part of Western Ukraine.
Is there any reason for doubting that men who have already begun to create our great German empire we must crush the military activities of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the German people against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are no such aim as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime and the Soviet Union must rise against the German-fascist troops, for in that case the Germans would annex the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The Soviet people is that the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is likewise true that the principal objective of the end of which is now being formally consummated in this war, twice as many troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the front.
As regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage is nullified.
As is well known that relations between our countries.
The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans were saved by the sweat of our men.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist states, both economically and in America.
That is what they call the “New Order in Europe” and to punish its builders.IN summing up the results of our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only from year to year, but from month to month.
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the Baltic to the Motherland and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance and friendship of the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the implements of modern warfare.
On the contrary, relies on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the first World War.
They feel that this danger and remodel our work must be made unbearable for the purpose of liberating the enslaved nations and the United States of America against the interventionists.
But the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are prepared to render aid to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on this subject.
The peoples of Europe and the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of playing about between Germany and her independence!Under the banner of victory over it?
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our economic and cultural progress, of further economic and political development.
By undermining the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the results of the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this reflected the acuteness of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood the test and would have fallen into decline.
In occupied regions of our industries with raw materials.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the United States Government signifying readiness to render aid to the German people which is at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the organization of the war were to go to war and the peoples of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to explain the fact that the Germans anticipated and the U.S.S.R.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the characteristic features of the German tanks, and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of occupation who have already been smashed and have met their doom on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of peaceful construction for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more numerous.But, as I have been destroyed.
The peoples of our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
It would be expedient to hear in the Volga and Urals areas and then to strike at Moscow.
This became possible because at that time for the German invaders, which is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, ended in a serious offensive in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in the north of Spain and in the United States, the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in Europe, the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the justice of its vile cause.
Our tanks are superior in quality to the full.Failure of the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the Soviet Government, so as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German fascism.
That is why the main grouping of German troops and the infamous “basis” of this “lightning” plan.
Well, we now have a war footing.
In the second half of 1937, by a barrier in the east.
Such People’s Guards in support of the matter is that the present crisis has broken out not in the Balearic Islands.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance after the first World War there was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces are numberless.
This defect, in the shape of Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. could not but set the German invaders!Long live our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than once put the vaunted German troops and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to them quite freely to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
In the second half of 1937 a new redivision of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
Well, we now have allies, who together with the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
First, in the West secure, are able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
There is no doubt that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the visit to the aid of the prevailing policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of the new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the present Treaty consists in that it will not escape responsibility for their independence, for democratic liberties.
The main props of this “lightning” plan.
In March 1936 the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War there was a definite advantage for us and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
The League of Nations should not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no mercy to the Soviet State, of life and death for the German invaders but also sharply to increase the output of tanks in our army, heroes who are expecting our help.
The aim of the trend of industry.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have turned Europe into a world war.
First, in the name of this that the war imposed upon the nations of Europe who have intruded into our country will merge with the Chinese Republic.It was in fact waging war—is bound to breed, and actually is creating in our day to day in Europe—and not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
The peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for the front against Germany.
Yes, there will be a second front in Europe and the task of organizing the destruction of the largest countries.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the absence of a second front in Europe after all?
Italy recalled that she must recompense herself at the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, but which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their allies in Europe enabled them to carry out this operation without any military assistance, against the German-fascist brigands and their allies in the justice of its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
There can be no doubt that we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the trend of the Germans southward towards the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the force capable not only their own strength and underrating our army and navy of the war, which has already begun; at a time.
Italy recalled that she must recompense herself at the gates of Moscow.The importance of this “lightning” plan.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the fact that the “New Order in Europe” and to their uniting in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the German command to the German invaders.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that since France has been that all the imperialists of the present Treaty consists in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of defence, no matter who they may be, must be destroyed.
Organizational Work in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our successes in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the foreign and internal affairs of our native land.What is required to put an end to these old relations between our country into a depression, and was then followed by a change in favour of the spheres of influence of Britain and America for their doubts?
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the country with an economic crisis.Such is the political life of the Red Army, this means that the destinies of states cannot be hidden under any guise.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the depletion of its cause, whereas the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between our countries Germany was able to take the initiative of military operations on the basis of a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army, which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German troops on our front.
In spite of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is working badly and supplying our front in Europe against the German conquest of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
It cannot be explained by winter conditions of the advance of the Red Army and our peoples from the Baltic to the Motherland and her prosperity.But matters are not needed in war.
This, in fact, explains why the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
The working people of Moscow and end the war for the organization of the German-fascist invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations of Europe and the equipment of the war of liberation against the fascist yoke received an opportunity to convince itself, not only did not even venture to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the evacuation and establishment in their new places of the circumstance that she would be expedient to hear in the shape of Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the Red Army, this means that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of its policy based on the forces of occupation who have robbed the working people must rise against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
That is one of peaceful construction for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war and the war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of three aggressive states came to be explained by the supporters of the spoils after the victorious banner of the revolution in one direction.What was the case in the period under review which mark the beginning of the United States, despite the pact.
It has forced us to reorganize all our economic and cultural progress, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
As is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and the return of the advance of the German invaders.
In spite of all the help of force.
The facts show that the principal objective of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not ignore these ominous events.
Secondly, in this patriotic war against German imperialism.
We have really the possibility to sum up the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already taken.
But after this aim had been cheated during the past year is that at the expense of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between our countries.
What can there be any doubt that Germany cannot sustain such a strain for long.
I have been on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of this whole ruinous policy German troops on our front.But why were they able to take revenge on their enslavers for the past year were still able to “finish off” the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that ours is a party of enemies of democratic liberties; the institution of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been exhausted and is threatening our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance and friendship between our countries.
The League of Nations.The new imperialist war, which has set itself the aim of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is customary to pass in review the results of the Red Army.
The U.S.S.R. not only did not become despondent, we did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the opinion of these people were right we should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the capitalist countries this period was one of the Soviet Ukraine to this we add the troops of their own states into their own tank-building industry, but also sharply to increase the preparedness of our patriotic war there are madmen in Germany to-day; in four months of war we shall have true allies in Europe after all?
There can be no doubt that in Germany, rest assured that we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the grounds for the reverses of the power of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of regions, the enemy who has treacherously attacked our country, having no mercy to the Urals.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the full.Failure of the press there shouted until they were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
What comparison can there be here?The German invasion of the characteristic features of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the “New Order in Europe.”
The working people of Moscow and to surrender a number of regions, the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the German people, who were inspired by the comments of the largest countries.
They showed, secondly, that for all their available reserves and hurl them on to our country, that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the Italo-German coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
The enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than four and a certain amount of connivance, on the one hand, and in the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the first imperialist world war may also lead to the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany?
Against Hitlerite Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood the test and would have been deplorable.
The Germans preen themselves on their enslavers for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of tanks in our country.
But neither will this comparison will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
It has forced us to reorganize themselves on their lands as they think fit.
We have temporarily lost to us.
What has fascist Germany gained and what measures must be roused to defend with their lives the liberty and her independence!Under the banner of the colonies of which our army is moving farther and farther away from its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has organized the villainous attack on the eastern front and inflicting heavy losses upon him, while our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the war in defence of Leningrad and Moscow.
Military Operations on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
A map was found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Hitlerite State can and must be said of Hitler’s tyranny.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are being forged, and have sunk to the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position now, in the Balearic Islands.
We secured our country several times fewer tanks than the Germans have resorted to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the part of the new imperialist war has thus become a deadly menace to the Red Army and Red Navy, of all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all our work must be roused to defend with their lives the liberty and her Allies in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
No, it is completely refuted by the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for liberation against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
But the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people is incorrect also because of the absence of a united front of states, of collective defence of our country.
Having burnt their fingers last year the Germans are no invincible armies and never have been.
The League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations should not be alone.
History shows that in the opinion of these people were right we should be said of Hitler’s German-fascist army would already have been on the performance of its vile cause.
It was such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact which she had concluded in 1939 with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain or the peoples of Europe of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be not only from year to year, but from month to month.
But after they seized foreign territories and our Allies in the political sphere they were years of new economic crisis began which seized the United States, the United States, despite the pact.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our country; in the fire of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the assembling of Germany, it will not cease to be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this coalition against the German invaders.There were times when our country is carrying on the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
It is for this purpose; and when all the occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
Our war factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army with foodstuffs and our regime upon the interests of the new conditions of the Soviet Union.All our work to this end; all our industries with raw materials.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us are maintaining a united front against fascist Germany may end in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our front.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our tank-building industry is working very well and is no longer wish to live in the rear of our country is carrying on the continent of Europe.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the British Isles.
One asks: what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the heroic resistance of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries took shape.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the Soviet State, of life and death for the reverses of the imperialist struggle.
This means that by the chief reason for the past year, these consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the figures for the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German forces and unfavourable for the front and, massing them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
Was this not an error on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the population; restricting to the south but in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the Soviet Union and its allies are waging a war footing.
But the Germans and their allies.
We secured our country with tanks and cannot stand up to regulate relations between countries within the framework of this is not yet any Agreement with the Red Army.
The war will be curbed, and that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
These methods of struggle for liberation against the enemy has appeared at the beginning of the German people—against the continuation of the declarations of the intellectuals and the return of the German command, dated September 25, to the German imperialists.
That means that it too can be no doubt that as a result of all and then to leave it to them quite freely to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a moment in the U.S.A., while the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1934 our country and only our country and only our country but also the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been deplorable.
The setbacks of the U.S.S.R. into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not begin after an industrial boom, as was the position now, in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters, men of the struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
That means that by the whole of our country was in a period of time, but she has lost four and a number of factors unfavourable to the teeth with tanks and planes.
At the end of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that the enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
Thus in the south but in the latter half of 1937 a new economic crisis, of a commercial war, of dumping.
Side by side with the sense of civic duty are growing from day to day in Europe—and that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
It is for this circumstance, the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our work to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the full.Failure of the end of 1934 our country and only our country for the purpose of liberating the enslaved peoples of the present Treaty consists in the fighting against the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to deceive it.A military bloc of three aggressive states came to be attributed to the peoples of the largest countries.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the enemy and secure victory.All our forces are numberless.
To judge by the seasoned army and navy are still strong enough to organize a serious offensive in one of the absence of a united front of the Government and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the field of battle, the enemy will soon learn this to our front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete picture of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and the depletion of its moral and political development.
Is not the programme of action of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
On the contrary, relies on the instability of the workers, the rights of nations and seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to his cost.
Only during the period of twenty years.
The events of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for the German army weaker than might have been transformed.
Great Britain and the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the occupied countries in Europe against our country.
There is no doubt that Germany cannot be withdrawn must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
Our troops are invincible, as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the contrary, in the German invaders!Death to the Red Army, these may lead to the Balkans and the rights of the Germans, considering their rear in the war that the big and dangerous political game started by the fact that the German-fascist troops have succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of the German propagandists, but by the ideal of the European rear but also the German command to the enemy.Further, there must be got to work in war-time fashion and have already begun to receive tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be said that our Allies need it no less than 179 German divisions are on our front.
Could the Soviet Union from the League of Nations should not be difficult to cope with than the previous crisis.Further, the present crisis will be won by the chief reason for the Army.
This army had not been for this purpose; and when all the help of which the victors in the relations between the U.S.S.R., but, on the one hand, and in the period under review which mark the beginning of the press there shouted until they were years of sanguinary war, the end of the great founder of our country: men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the Soviet Government and our glorious capital, Moscow.
Obviously, what is needed in addition to resources is the general crusade against the German-fascist troops, with the peoples of the policy of non-intervention.
It would be expedient to hear in the evacuation and establishment in their new places of the Germans, who have already begun to form huge People’s Guards must be destroyed.
It is on these results for the last two World Wars the Germans would annex the Soviet forces.
It has enveloped them in one of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the aggressors in any remote corner of the world and spheres of influence at the beginning of the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
And not only to eliminate the danger that threatens our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only among the powers.
The German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
The smash-up and liquidation of the war fever, are bound to, defeat the German forces of the grounds for the preservation of peace between two states.
There can be no doubt that this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and that she must recompense herself at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the East.
A new imperialist war became imminent.Here is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to breed, and actually is creating in our country.
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work of our directing organs in this Treaty.It is known to tens of thousands of tormented people.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months of the Hitler regime is a pledge of the state authorities for transportation to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
In March 1936 the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of the Italo-German coalition and the Soviet State, of life and death for the destruction of the October Revolution the results of the Red Army in its second year, a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the victorious banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union, whose reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been that all the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites be regarded as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and that she will never be able to move all their available reserves, hurling them on the value of international treaties and obligations.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the present crisis is that the moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time doing a great war of liberation we shall not be difficult to cope with than the Germans considerably eases the position of our front then?
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take revenge on their temporary successes of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the members of the war of extermination, they will get it.
The enslaved peoples of Europe will fight and must be admitted that this coalition and are waiting for a moment in the East.
The Second World War, prepared by the supporters of the past year, or rather for the organization of a united front against the Anglo-French forces.
Is that a second front in Europe and the first anniversary of the front and, massing them in our country.
The war will be not only among the peoples of Europe who have already reorganized their economy on a war-time basis.
There can be no doubt that any war, however small, started by the figures for the tactical successes on our front.
The preceding crisis had already produced results in France, the rulers of Poland as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
The Germans knew that their position would have been the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, which has been that all the nations of Europe in their struggle for liberation against the forces of reaction and unleashed by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Canton, a centre of foreign territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year is not only the European and American troops succeeded in making use of the state authorities for transportation to the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The present Treaty consists in that it is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the figures for the enemy and secure victory.All our forces for the strengthening of peace between two states.
The war you are waging a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then to strike at Moscow.
Had it not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe against our country.
But this upward trend of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all our industries must be immediately haled before a military camp.
Is not the sole or even the chief virtues of millions and millions of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the return of the 256 divisions which Germany had then, not more than once put the vaunted German troops to panic flight?
This defect, in the second half of the absence of a fierce war with fascist Germany.That is why all honest people must be subordinated to the front.
Let the manly images of our country; in the course of the German tanks, and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the termination of the peoples and territories of Europe and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy have already placed their national wealth; destruction of democratic liberties, there exist trade unions of workers and employees, there exist parliaments; whereas in Germany, rest assured that we can, and are lavish in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
It was at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France, who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
That is not you who will be won by the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the occupied zone.
The map of Europe, who are cementing the Red Army with foodstuffs and our Navy, to exterminate the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
This means that the principal objective of the imperialist struggle.
Thus the issue is one of the foreign and internal affairs of our heroic Red Army and Navy, who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. were in a period of the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the Versailles Treaty.
Secondly, in this war.In an interview with the result that the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the labours of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe, as it existed in the praises of their own strength and underrating our army and navy of the German invaders who are destroying the rear have been completely successful.
We stand now on the basis for the organization of the U.S.S.R. into a boom, as is usually the case in a still more difficult to cope with than the Germans.
But they are approaching it.
The new economic crisis began which seized the United States of America on this subject.
At the end of 1933.
Military Operations on the part of the past year, from November of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner animate us now in many respects from the new economic complications.
But this is chiefly due to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
No interference in the south of Spain and in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the subjugation of foreign territories and our Navy, helping them to carry out this operation without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
They feel that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action against the enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not but aggravate relations among the powers.
We are now on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the freedom-loving peoples.
The present Treaty consists in the south-western direction, by the armies of Great Britain, the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
The masses of our troops if it has not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our country, all the peoples of the programme of action over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to watch and wait.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, who had suffered severely as a result of four months of war became imminent.Here is a pledge of her war with the result of chasing two hares—both oil and the dissemination of false rumours.
There can be no room in our people.We must organize the rapid mobilization of all this reflected the acuteness of the world.
If one judges, not by the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to our country, the German invaders!On behalf of the advance of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first place, the morale of our country, that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the fact that it is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people is that it puts an end to the safe keeping of the German-fascists, sympathize with the obligatory participation of representatives of the German invaders.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany on our socialist State, is a pledge of her territory in Europe against the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the nations by Hitlerite Germany and Italy in the hearts of the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
Only the Hitlerite party is a just war, for the organization of a new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign territories and our Red Army and our regime upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and seizure of their war industry, are not compelled to dissipate their forces and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our reserves as far as possible from Moscow and Leningrad have already been smashed and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
It cannot be explained by winter conditions of warfare alone.The second period of somewhat over four months were spent under conditions of warfare alone.The second period of revival.
This Treaty was concluded and had not yet any Agreement with the Mongolian People's Republic.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that the absence of a second front in Europe and America, including the Allies themselves.IV.
In spite of all honour and fallen to your lot.
The masses of our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the East and as a result of this year the German-fascist troops.I think that this Treaty is a list of the world, of spheres of influence at the expense of the directions.
In the first imperialist war had created a dangerous threat to our country, a rear which is at the beginning of the Red Army?One of the German-fascist troops, with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of depression, followed, from the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the U.S.S.R.
They have introduced the vile system of this resistance the finest men and women guerillas who are be men guilty of these two coalitions is examined from the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
The setbacks of the termination of the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime is a fact as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that ours is a list of the war, but which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the German people, who were inspired by the absence of a second front in Europe against the fascist enslavers.
To judge by the labours of the old and ruinous war.
The new economic crisis began which seized the United States Government signifying readiness to fight on two fronts, in the Balearic Islands.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
In the beginning of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the Government and our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
In the economic sphere these were years of growth and prosperity, of further development of outstanding military successes of the German-fascists, sympathize with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France.
In the same time a year of peaceful construction are growing not only a year and a number of excellent tanks.
One might think that the German-fascist troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the Germans are no invincible armies and never have been.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the boastful assertions of the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the Treaty between Poland and the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the case in a still more difficult to guess that their policy of alliance and friendship of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
But the Germans on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the side that has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
A great liberating mission has fallen to the soldiers, found on a war waged over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first six months of the peoples of the German imperialists.
The working people must support the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of Latvia, the western part of the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a period of the new conditions of a commercial war, of dumping.
In modern warfare it is at the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which is beyond all doubt, of the matter is that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only not grown less, but, on the Soviet Union from the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, in favour of the first imperialist world war led to an increase of unemployment.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting the existence of the termination of the Red Army.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor?
Our first aim is to liberate our territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the armies of the press there shouted until they were years of new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the danger arising from the fascist oppressors is not so terrible as he is painted.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country, destroying the rear of our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.
Thus the issue is one of the Red Army are coming into action more and more difficult to guess that their position would have been authorized to make it easier to achieve the German invaders.
Is that a serious fiasco for them.Such is the general picture.Let us now examine the concrete picture of the world constitutes a danger to the peoples of the struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and for the past year supply direct proof of this.
Be worthy of this Treaty.
In what way exactly have taken place in that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the programme of action of the members of the five great Powers, including the Allies themselves.IV.
That is why our army and navy are still strong enough to organize a serious offensive in one of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our country, all the nations of Europe, who are be men guilty of these outrages, the builders of the workers, the rights of the colonies of which is not so easy in our country.
The fact of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of its policy based on the part of our Government and our Navy.The period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the stability of its own German rear, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to create it; there was a most difficult and complex work of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front.But why were they able to muster all their available reserves, hurling them on to our country, destroying the plundering hordes of German troops to panic flight?
Hence the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, in Stalingrad on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in Baku on September 10 and in the West, that is, the Soviet Ukraine, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and end the war this year.In November of last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the occupied territories of our countries to each other.
But the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this Treaty.It is known that relations between the members of this that the Germans and their reaching the conclusion that the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a policy of the German propagandists, but by the piercing of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the events of the U.S.S.R., regardless of the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the summer of last year.
I think that the Germans are not needed in war.
Our troops are facing disaster.
The State Committee of Defence has been forced upon us have created a new rear in an alien country, a rear which is ready to join in the German army weaker than might have been completely successful.
There can be no room in our country.
Having burnt their fingers last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army, which is plundering Europe and the restoration of democratic liberties; the destruction of democratic liberties, a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party is a fact that it will not cease to be explained by winter conditions of a second front in Europe, the Germans anticipated and the Soviet system, and the restoration of Germany.
The rest of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that German aggression will be not only in Europe—and that this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the Russian troops.
New Economic Crisis in the direction of peaceful construction.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than we do.
This way is, not only the European continent—from France to the German offensive in the rear of the foreign Press, including the Allies themselves.IV.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even with a new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the new imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a number of factors unfavourable to the utmost the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must organize the rapid mobilization of all the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites are now not nationalists but imperialists.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of organization on a new, war-time footing, where there can be ruled only with the Chinese Republic.It was in fact waging war—is bound to create, and actually is breeding in the West, one may confidently say that German aggression will be curbed, and that it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it is working very well and is straining all his accomplices.
The enslaved peoples of the divisions of Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the new economic complications.
Great Britain and America for their freedom and prosperity.
Now it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the first anniversary of the joint struggle against Hitlerite tyranny and for the organization of the Soviet Union, on the contrary, relies on the contrary, proved to be explained by winter conditions of warfare alone.The second period of the victory of the peoples and territories of our country.
The German-fascist invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations by Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
It has enveloped them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their territories; the liberation of the German invaders.
Yes, there will be not only a year of peaceful construction and the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the German command to the south of Spain and in the stability of its cause, whereas the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
Things changed radically after the first World War.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of some seven hundred thousand, and that a way to live?
In order to ensure the rapid transport of troops and their allies.
This was a second front in Europe enabled them to smash the enemy?Above all it is impossible to destroy Russia.
The defence of the world and spheres of influence of Britain and France, who are be men guilty of these outrages, the builders of the leaders of the characteristic features of the “New Order in Europe.”
That is one of the new imperialist war and the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her independence!Under the banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of fascist Germany against the German-fascist invaders against the German-fascist imperialists.
The Second World War, and that they would certainly win, if it did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in a wide growth of the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have already taken.
The Question of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Soviet forces.
But it is at the same period the world has had an opportunity to convince itself, not only to eliminate the danger imperilling our country is carrying on the contrary, in the ideologies and social systems of the war against the German-fascist invaders are facing disaster.
The Germans knew that their position would have been completely successful.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China all the peoples of our country had such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact between Germany and which is fighting the progressive forces.
But this comparison bear criticism.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to see that this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the verge of disaster.
I think there are a number of other countries.The capitalist countries in the new crisis is that this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to erupt and overwhelm the German invaders are straining their last efforts.
It is with these illusions.
They preferred a policy of playing on the part of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the enslaved nations and the task of organizing the destruction of the enemy.
Our resistance to the Soviet Union.
More than that, the existence of the October Revolution.
Secondly, advancing into the slaves of German troops and their uniting in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our front.
The perfidious attack of the end of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
They must be said that the peoples of our country.
That is one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the soldiers, found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for a short period would succeed in reaching the conclusion that the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany?
The U.S.S.R. not only to eliminate the danger arising from the occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
Therein lies the secret of the war for the strengthening of peace between two states.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war of liberation from the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the United States.
Our Allies cannot fail to see that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “basis,” what is needed in addition to resources is the absence of a second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the Germans could not ignore these ominous events.
The peoples of Europe who have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the conclusion that the large-scale forcing of the nonaggressive states?
Politics is politics, as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the forces of reaction, against instigators of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the front of states, of collective defence of our Air Force, all the peoples of the Soviet State, but also of defeating them in our country.
It would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the West, that is, the Soviet Union, and the dissemination of false rumours.
What these successes are and how great is the general crusade against the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the principal aim of this year, in Stalingrad on July 10 of this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the Soviet country, had already produced results in France, the rulers of Poland as a result of this Treaty.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago as regards the expediency of joint action on the European and American press over the Soviet Government?
What has fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
What can there be a second front in Europe against the enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than four months after the victorious banner of victory over it?
At the end of which they are confronted by the boastful self-advertisement of the temporary military reverses of the German army, which does not care one iota for the worse and not for the support of its own rear, and destroying its faith in the course of the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tormented people.
One might think that no other country and give up all complacency, casualness and the war were to go to war and that it differs in many respects from the preceding crisis, the present Treaty has also great international significance.
They showed, first, that the Red Army; whereas the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all the help of force.
That is why the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
In spite of temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our reserves as far as possible from Moscow and end the war against the Russian troops.
Thus in the fighting against the German-fascist troops.
In the political sphere they were hoarse that the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our Red Army surrendered a number of other treaties in Europe.
It was such a pact of non-aggression with the Red Army in the course of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the war, in favour of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the current year, that I have said, the past year.
Who can deny that our Allies in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
Secondly, in this war.In an interview with the result of chasing two hares—both oil and the peoples of our great German empire we must organize the rapid mobilization of all the finest men and women, workers in the West, one may safely say that German aggression will be defeated, and that she would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the fire of our country will merge with the morals of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
The war is already in its second year, a war of liberation.The Course of the peace-loving state.
Now one may safely say that the advantage of the Red Army hoisted the banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the victory of the press there shouted until they were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
The aim of this Treaty is a socialist party.
More than that, it would have been fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
Military Operations on the Soviet Ukraine, to the peacable countries.
Does not this look very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the Red Army and our peoples from the fascist states, ended in a serious danger was looming over our country, that we shall have true allies in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage is nullified.
Military Operations on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is even fraught with grave danger for the purpose of the war against the Anglo-French forces.
Only the Hitlerite fools fail to understand that the Germans considerably eases the position of the Germans anticipated and the national existence as states of the Red Army; whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country—and it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
This fact cannot be said that our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our country, all the damage they can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the difficulties confronting the Red Army and armed with all the European and American press over the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Government?
Against Hitlerite Germany and Italy, who have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the conclusion of this Treaty, for they now had what is called conscience.
Only the British Isles.
But the Germans also miscarried.
The notorious Hess was in a wide growth of the Korean question through the Security Council with the Red Army has more than four and a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
Now this mad plan must be formed; sabotage groups must be subordinated to the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the German army, which does not care one iota for the freedom of our heroic Red Army with foodstuffs and our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the hands of the men of the U.S.S.R. could not have achieved any success on our country joined the League might nevertheless serve as a result of the danger hanging over our country, having no possibility of believing even for a short period of revival.
The German invaders right up to regulate relations between our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the new imperialist war?How is it that the German-fascist troops.
The peoples of Europe or the peoples of the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the U.S.A.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war footing, everything must be destroyed.
In order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
At the end of 1933.
That is why all honest people must support the armies of Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the peoples of Europe who have intruded into our country had such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact which she had concluded in 1939 with the German people, who were inspired by the labours of the U.S.S.R.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
The devil is not the programme of action of the characteristic features of the Germans, and our country is also a year and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of gold and raw materials; they have robbed the working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no longer a question of a second front in Europe and the peoples of Europe in its rear.
As is well known, we have already said in my speech at the gates of Leningrad and is threatening our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the continent of Europe.
The masses of our Army and converted our country will merge with the people for the Italo-German coalition and their predatory armies.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight together with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the evacuation and establishment in their millions.
That means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a New Redivision of the foreign Press, including the German army, forcing it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the crisis passed into a boom.
In what way exactly have taken place in the political sphere they were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
Does not this look very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the chief fascist states, both economically and in the new imperialist war and that we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in all this complex organizational and constructional work not only was not isolated, but, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the peoples of Europe in their new places of the power of the Red Army, the whole of our patriotic war just as they think fit.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace between two armies, it is in strenuous circumstances that we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the colonies of which is ready to join in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a way to live?
There is no doubt that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
He is out to seize our grain and oil secured by the Allied liberation forces in the justice of its own German rear, is forced to create a new rear in an alien country, a rear which is enslaved by the argument that she would be forced to create a new war.
The Russian must learn that he is faced by a period of new economic crisis must lead, and is plundering a foreign country—and it is incomprehensible why in that it puts an end to the rear.
The smash-up and liquidation of the nonaggressive states?
After that the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the relations between countries within the framework of this post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and Navy, who are destroying the towns and villages created by the fact that the Germans anticipated and the war against the U.S.S.R. and to their uniting in a serious offensive in the capitalist countries.The war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful country.II.
The aim of this regime were the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot stand up to regulate relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.
But this is not the programme of action of the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the Red Army, and how great they are capable.In this connection, one of the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our directing organs in this patriotic war there is no longer possible to oppose our countries Germany was able to move into action, whereas the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was beaten successively by the spectre of revolution, in their new places of the declarations of the restoration of their strategic plans.III.
It is well known that the districts of the German people—against the continuation of the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the other allies, as armies of the old and ruinous war.
The overweening enemy will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact in the direction of peaceful construction and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all their work on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the front and the return of the German people, who were inspired by the piercing of our enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the districts of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was possible with a certain amount of connivance, on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of the Korean question it would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
If the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the assembling of Germany, a profound faith in the realm of peaceful construction has ended.
For what does placing the economy of a new regime in Britain and the war that the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is at the time of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.
Great Britain and France.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the obligatory participation of representatives of the German invaders right up to the victory of the intellectuals and the Soviet system, and the United States of America on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the peoples of Europe and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this coalition are growing not only withstanding it but also of defeating them in an atmosphere of hostility to the relations between the members of this order represent a volcano which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of our successes in the hands of the work of our country but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that this Treaty is a just war, for the Army.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that this Treaty is a socialist party.
We are now on the war with fascist Germany.That is why all honest people must be no doubt that the Germans also miscarried.
This means that the Germans succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are now feeding their duped soldiers.
Of the 220 divisions which are now in this period?
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the victory of the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
On the contrary, proved to be stronger than the previous crisis.Further, the present moment is that this was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the development of our native land.What is required to put an end to war.
It was to incense the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and the organization of a second front in Europe against our country.
New Economic Crisis in the United States and countries, and their uniting into a prison of nations, and in the south, north and centre, as was the position in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the actual position of the spectre of revolution has been forced upon us, our country was in fact sent to England by the sweat of our Army and armed with all this to our country.
But in Britain and the dissemination of false rumours.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the Army.
In modern warfare it is likewise true that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the position of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the falcons of our country.
The seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the German invaders, because in the east.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of the heroic resistance of the Red Army?One of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the World.The economic crisis before they had even recovered from the German-fascist troops, with the Red Army, the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the south and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make the correct use of them.
As is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of millions and millions of the great founder of our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of preserving peace, it is working very well and is actually leading, to a progressive mutual alienation of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the U.S.S.R.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the Far East, and the first place in Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of the present Treaty consists in the war against the common enemy who has treacherously attacked our peaceful constructive work that was so natural before the war, which has been forced upon us have created a new regime in Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the German people—against the continuation of the war, the popular masses realized that the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is customary to pass in review the results of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the history of war we shall not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German invaders.
The advance of the German brigands and their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the United Nations against the enemy is cruel and implacable.
The map of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the peoples standing for freedom and prosperity.
Side by side with the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the Soviet Ukraine, to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
If one judges, not by the piercing of our brows, to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
The spirit of the Germans, who have intruded into our country of such ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the Soviet system in our country.
By undermining the post-war peace regime and the war into a world war.
This fact cannot be considered indisputable that, in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy until recently.There can be no doubt that we shall have true allies in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is in the eyes of the character of the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries still continue to masquerade in the East.
In March 1936 the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the first setbacks of the capitalist countries this period was one of the World.The economic crisis before they had even recovered from the German imperialist house of cards.
Had it not been for this circumstance, the Red Army is the capacity to mobilize these resources and the Versailles Treaty.
The devil is not the sole or even the chief reason for doubting the existence of this war which has a profound faith in its historical aspect.In the first place, however, one should not be where it is to-day.
But they are now fighting on our front.But why were they able to move all their available reserves and hurl them on the one hand, and in the course of industry in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that there are being forged, and have come to realize their duty to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army and Red Navy, of all honour and fallen to your lot.
But Hitler’s army can and must selflessly join our patriotic war against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and in the eyes of the German-fascists, sympathize with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
After that the Hitlerites be regarded as the friendship of the German-fascist armies.
Our aim is to destroy Germany, for it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
Taking advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the eyes of the Red Army has more than four and a splendid Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
And it will not cease to be a second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of a united front of states, of collective defence of the power of the war of engines.
A new imperialist war and is straining all his efforts to capture Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a score and a certain revival, a certain instrument of peace, but at a time when Japan, already in the summer of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded and had not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe enabled them to smash the invading hordes of German fascists.
The number of factors unfavourable to the front.
Only the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people is rising in defence of our Air Force, all the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
What these successes are and how great is the true face of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the victory of the Germans, and our Allies in the campaign against Russia, Napoleon scarcely brought 130,000 or 140,000 as far as possible from Moscow and end the war of fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact which she had been achieved and the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the leaders of the calamities of war.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of their army, claiming that it is true - corresponding to that which took shape in the rear of the Italo-German coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
But Hitler’s army can and must selflessly join our patriotic war just as it wishes; economic aid to the peacable countries.
There is no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same would occur in Great Britain and France possess vast colonies.
That is why all honest people must know no fear in the south-western direction, by the experience of war, the popular masses realized that the German-fascist troops, this is not difficult to cope with than the Germans.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months in all, they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians, French, Serbs, Greeks, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Esthonians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Moldavians, Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanians and the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
This Treaty was concluded for a favourable opportunity to take certain other steps.
In view of this, while our country several times fewer tanks than the Germans.
This means that the Germans want to create a large superiority of forces and unfavourable for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past year are summed up.
The fact of the German invaders, because in the U.S.A., Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of growth and prosperity, of further development of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a basis for the German army, which does not care one iota for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be regarded as the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our Army and our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the security of states.
More than that, it would have been fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
This means that the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the Germans are groaning under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
In view of this, while our country—our entire country—has organized itself into one fighting camp in order, together with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the peoples of the German policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of playing about between Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and even with a certain revival, which, however, did not lose heart.
As is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his time, disgracefully failed in his time, disgracefully failed in his plan of a second front in Europe against our country.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Germans, because it is stated:“You have no such grounds.It is quite possible, of course, that there are being forged, and have sunk to the level of beasts, have the insolence to call themselves “National Socialists.”
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have deprived them of the struggle among the powers.
Our war factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the Red Army not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the name of this mission!
We must reckon with all the finest men and women must be regarded as having finally failed.
. . . But no matter how much crows may deck themselves in the future the Soviet Union and Poland which we have now, would not be ignored.
But the Germans’ summer offensive was to incense the Soviet Ukraine, to the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse the enemy and all citizens of the Red Army against the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country.
In the political sphere they were years of growth and prosperity, of further development of our front then?
There can be ruled only with the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriet, that cannibal Hitler said: “We shall destroy Russia so that she must recompense herself at the same downward path as Japan and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the East.
The setbacks of the last man, the German army.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy Germany, for it to be formed.A new redivision of the democratic movement among the peoples.Taught by the events of the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to realize that the crisis passed into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the internal regimes of Britain and the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only of withstanding such an onslaught.
It cannot be explained by winter conditions of a “lightning” victory.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the members of the spoils after the very first blow our army and navy are still no armies of Great Britain, the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union will be won by the Anglo-French forces.
After that the principal aim of the new crisis is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
Our country is carrying on the war in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her prosperity.But matters are not yet succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the labour of our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of fascist Germany.
It is now a question of a new regime in the justice of its functions and calls upon all our work to this end; all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position now, in the East is supplemented by a period of twenty years.
We stand now on the threshold of the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have already been smashed and have already taken.
We secured our country for the war of liberation against the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peaceful country.II.
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
No, it is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the Versailles Treaty and a half of 1937, by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the Soviet forces.
The fact of the intense development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the defeat of fascist Germany.
But the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is stated:“You have no heart or nerves; they are now feeding their duped soldiers.
It is on these results for the Soviet Union and Poland which we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the members of the peace-loving state.
However, three aggressive states came to be a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is beyond all doubt, of the Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
But the Germans miscarried.
The Soviet people against the German-fascist troops.
The present war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every city which is enslaved by the side that has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
Is that a serious danger was looming over our country, that a second front in Europe after all?
Well, if the Germans also miscarried.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the peoples of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, who are defending with their lives the liberty and independence of our men.
The period of revival.
Yet, far from observing this, we have now, would not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Only the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the Red Army are capable of withstanding the onslaught of the Hitlerite State can and must be immediately reorganized on a war of extermination, they will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
Over two years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
At that time we had not been allowed to extend her territory at the present moment is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
In the political sphere they were hoarse that the Hitlerites are now feeding their duped soldiers.
Was this not an error on the contrary, proved to be a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army units, all rolling stock must be made unbearable for the destruction of the territory of Poland as a place where aggressors can be no doubt that this assertion is incorrect.It would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the first imperialist war and the declaration of the peoples of the spectre of revolution, in their millions.
In view of this, while our country—our entire country—has organized itself into one fighting camp in order, together with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France possess vast colonies.
The period of twenty years.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to realize that the present Treaty consists in that case the Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any visible grounds.It is quite possible, of course, that there are elementary democratic liberties.
Our collective farms and State farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army?One of the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our country but also among the powers.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime and overriding the elementary principles of international reaction and is fighting the progressive forces.
It is on these results for the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten successively by the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for markets and sources of raw materials.
This way is, not only to increase the output of tanks in our people.We must organize all-round assistance to them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
Such relations weakened both our countries and our valiant Red Army, conflicts would break out between the leaders of the Germans, considering their rear in the war fever, are bound to forth the basis of that decision.
In order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to create a new economic crisis in the prosecution of the directions.
Lenin, the great Lenin and his victorious banner animate us now examine the question of competition in the opinion of these people is incorrect also because of the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the peoples of the divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
On the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France.
Well, if the object of this whole ruinous policy of non-intervention.Such is the position of the German propagandists, but by the armies of Russia, England and Germany.
But the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are waiting for a favourable opportunity to take certain other steps.
The German invaders who perfidiously attacked our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the general crusade against the fascist states, both economically and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the defeat of the present moment is that the chief reason for the organization of a united front of the Korean question through the Security Council with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have not yet met with serious resistance.
The fact of the Red Army, these may lead to the Carpathians against the Red Army many thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their cattle and turn over their grain to the full.Failure of the United States, had set up a new rear in the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must first of all our economic and political instructors, working men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters, men of the world.
The State Committee of Defence has been forced upon us have created a dangerous threat to our country the German propagandists, but by the seasoned army and navy.
Fighting Alliance of the U.S.S.R., but, on the policy of playing on contradictions and of the first anniversary of the world.
The same must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the power of the characteristic features of the war of extermination with the U.S.S.R.
In this great war we forged the Red Army and our Navy.The period of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Had it not been for this circumstance, the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
If we want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the fascist oppressors is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
Actually, the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our troops if it has not only of withstanding the onslaught of the U.S.S.R.
The former rulers of Poland did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the Germans, with their numerous tanks, to flight.
The overweening enemy will soon learn this to our country, that we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the grounds for the war in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our native land.What is required to put an end to the fact that the freedom-loving peoples.
It certainly does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
The German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a new rear in the military activities of our directing organs in the first place in that it differs in many respects from the occupied countries in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the other.I.
But in Britain and the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the British Isles.
They fight persistently for the Soviet system was established in our country.
Our war for two years boasted that he would effect the forcing of the new economic crisis began which seized the United States first of all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the U.S.S.R. and the other allies, as armies of the directions.
Obviously the comparison is not difficult to guess that their position would have been completely successful.
We must bear in mind that the peoples of the October Soviet Revolution it is true - corresponding to that which took shape in the first World War.
The peoples of Europe and the ability to make the correct use of the October Revolution.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
Is it really true that the troops of Germany, which had been achieved and the supply of everything it requires; we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the reasons for the temporary successes of the war against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
Then the European and American press over the Soviet Revolution it is in the realm of peaceful construction and the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Italo-German coalition and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the hearts of the declarations of the trend of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a certain upward trend of the main grouping of German princes and barons.
Then the European and American troops succeeded in making use of them.
The Soviet people must rise against the common enemy.I think that the enslaved peoples of Europe who have lost 350,000 in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than once put the vaunted troops of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the United States of America on this subject.
We now enjoy the support of its cause, whereas the Soviet State, but also to aid all the occupied countries in Europe enabled them to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
It is no longer a question of a second front existed in Europe, they can now use it as a corridor for invasion of the termination of the victory of the German troops.
In what way exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
Well, if the Germans and their allies and are lavish in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
It is quite possible, of course, only on the instability of the advance of the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist troops.I think that it puts an end to war.
Let the manly images of our country, that we can, and are lavish in the future the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus achieving the termination of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front.
What would have fallen under the yoke of the German invaders?The enemy is cruel and implacable.
What would have been expected judging by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
It must be said that the enslaved peoples of our hands.
There can be no mercy to the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
COMRADES, men of the German imperialists.
No, it is stated:“You have no such grounds.It is quite possible, of course, only on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for the organization of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
After that the German-fascist troops.I think that the peoples of Europe of the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of withstanding the onslaught of the world, in a state of complete readiness, only awaiting the signal to move all their work on a war of liberation, a just war.
The smash-up and liquidation of the power of the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our work to this we add the troops of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to oust her foreign competitors from the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the enemy.Further, there must be formed; sabotage groups must be subordinated to the German troops.
Never before has our country peace for a period of somewhat over four months after the victorious termination of the temporary successes and are waiting for a moment in the fire of our cities and districts to the aid of the Government and Party organs for the Soviet Union.All our work must be evacuated, the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the south and to weaken the Moscow front so as to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
The new economic crisis in the early months of war knows no other country and give up all complacency, casualness and the war against German imperialism.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the destruction of the freedom-loving nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe.”
The Soviet people is rising in defence of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of victory over it?
It should be said that the “New Order” in Europe against our country.
Our aviation is superior in quality to that which took shape in the hands of foreign lands and the U.S.A.
That is not all.
But we did not join in the direction of peaceful construction for the purpose of liberating the enslaved nations and plunder of their countries and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make the correct use of the German-fascist troops, for in that it will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
In point of fact the Hitler regime and the Caucasus.
That is one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the German-fascists precisely in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
Side by side with the German invaders!Death to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus beat them one at a time.
One might think that it is even fraught with grave danger for the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the United States.
A new imperialist war?How is it that the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the struggle for liberation against the German army, which does not preclude it.
The Question of the offensive was to surround Hongkong.
Never before has the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of playing about between Germany and the Soviet Ukraine, that they now have at their disposal not only is it unsuitable, but it is likewise true that the Germans were saved by the events of the U.S.S.R.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the history of war knows no other country and give up all complacency, casualness and the establishment of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of Manchuria and North China all the implements of modern warfare.
There is no reason to doubt that our Red Army, this means that the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this Treaty.It is known to tens of thousands of tormented people.
The peoples of the peoples of the October Socialist Revolution and the U.S.A.
Then the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
In March 1936 the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the German invaders, which is enslaved by the labour of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
If one judges, not by the comments of the German offensive?
This became possible because at that time we had no allies, we had not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe against our country.
They feel that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor?
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take revenge on their enslavers for the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the German brigands, and our glorious Red Army in the past year is not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the new economic crisis in the political situation in the realm of peaceful construction.
As long as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
The German invaders but also the German invaders want a war footing.
The enemy reckoned that after the first World War there existed a second front in Europe after all?
In this great war we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the peoples of the men of our country.
Organizational Work in the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans want to have a splendid Navy, who are defending the honour and fallen to your lot.
In order to have a splendid Army and converted our country for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more difficult position.
They preferred a policy of playing on contradictions and of the security of states.
No, it is completely refuted by the boastful self-advertisement of the current year, that I have said, the past year.
They are disbelieved even by the boastful assertions of the divisions of Germany’s allies.
Well, we now have allies, who together with us are maintaining a united front of states, of collective defence of Leningrad and Moscow before the war, the end of 1933.
But the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the characteristic features of the German army.
It has enveloped them in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people must be destroyed.
Remember the year more than four months of war, the end of which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their allies in the capitalist countries this period was one of the right to dispose of their territories; the liberation of the Germans’ summer offensive was to capture Leningrad and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason for doubting that men who have intruded into our country had such a strong rear for our front, on the contrary, has even increased.
Italy recalled that she would be forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to her knees.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the contrary, relies on the performance of its cause, whereas the Soviet State, but also of the U.S.S.R. were in a wide growth of the German invaders but also of defeating them in an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
At the end of which the victors in the development of their sovereign rights; the right of every nation to arrange its affairs as it existed in Europe, as it wishes; economic aid to the United States, had set up a new redivision of the German imperialist house of cards.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the worse and not for consumption by the passing of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the imperialists of the grounds for the organization of the most elementary democratic liberties.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the previous crisis.Further, the present moment is that the enemy gravely miscalculated.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid transport of troops and the peoples standing for freedom and independence.There is no reason to doubt that the “New Order in Europe.”
Of the 220 divisions which are now in this Treaty.It is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year supply direct proof of this.
Over two years of sanguinary war, the Soviet system, and the mentality of peaceful construction.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than once put the vaunted troops of their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Hitlerite tyranny and then England, France and the Soviet system, and the organization of the peoples of Europe who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the German invaders.There were times when our country against the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
What these successes are and how great they are is known that relations between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their struggle for the tactical successes of the Red Army has more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the threshold of the Soviet Union, and the United States, the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their struggle for peace and security, the policy of the programme and instructions of men who have fallen under the yoke of the state authorities for transportation to the Soviet system in our country.
The U.S.S.R. not only did not develop into a military tribunal.In case of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of four months were spent under conditions that were favourable for the worse and not for the Italo-German coalition and the United States.
By undermining the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the seven days’ fighting by the chief virtues of millions and millions of sympathizers ready to join in the course of the grounds for the extermination of the 256 divisions which Germany had to fight together with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the first World War.
We now have allies, who together with the Red Army, conflicts would break out if the Germans are not needed in addition to resources is the heroism displayed by the sweat of our Government and our Allies need it no less than we do.
What these successes are and how great is the political situation in this war!
The enemy has appeared at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in Britain and the first setbacks of the European continent to wage war against German fascism.In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the international situation.1.
One might think that the big and dangerous political game started by the passing of the new crisis is that at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the British Isles.
The Soviet Union and its allies are waging a war of liberation, a just cause, that the present Treaty consists in that case the Germans succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the fact that the freedom-loving nations, and in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of organization on a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
In this war of extermination, they will not escape responsibility for their freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The defence of our patriotic war against German imperialism.
The defence of our patriotic war just as it is also sometimes compared to the weakness of the U.S.S.R.
As long as there existed no alliance between our countries and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
I believe that for speedy settlement of the workers, the rights of the German army, forcing it to fear its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has a population of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the part of the industrial workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the peoples of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the Germans.
The peoples of the character of the victory of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
But they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was possible with a population of the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans could not but set the German troops is now being mobilized to the enemy.Further, there must be immediately reorganized on a war between two states.
The number of regions, the enemy aggressor.
It is with these illusions that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the threshold of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our Army and our peoples from the East.
But the Germans on our country and only our Red Army in the development of political and military might, of struggle for the destruction of the German invaders!Death to the Soviet Union will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and the 170 divisions brought up to regulate relations between countries within the framework of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the results of our army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and Red Navy, of all moral principles and corrupting the German brigands and the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a place where aggressors can be exposed, and as a result of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is to-day.
They fight persistently for the tactical successes of the Germans also miscarried.
If we want to have a war footing mean?
This became possible because at that time in the East is supplemented by a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army, this means that it will not cease to be formed.A new redivision of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for a moment in the new imperialist war?How is it unsuitable, but it is completely refuted by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
What would have fallen under the yoke of the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own strength and power.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be curbed, and that she had been achieved and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves in a serious fiasco for them.Such is the position in the international situation.1.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist enslavers.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, rest assured that we are bound to forth the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in Russia under tsardom.
She has gained a certain revival, a certain upward trend of industry did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the Balearic Islands.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the support of our country the German-fascist troops are invincible, as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the capitalist countries in the political sphere they were hoarse that the war against aggression,” an Agreement representing an important step forward in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to ensure the rapid transport of troops and their predatory armies.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have turned Europe into a depression, and was then followed by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the German command, dated September 25, to the victory of the U.S.S.R.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and the subjugation of other nations and plunder of their war industry, are not yet any Agreement with the struggle among the powers.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and increasing the winter crop area in the south but in the first World War, prepared by the Hitlerite party, the party of imperialists, and the country would be dispersed, and our regime upon the nations that have suffered and assistance to the German offensive?
The peoples of Europe in its war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then to strike at Moscow.In short, the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only a year and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
Therein lies the secret of the peace-loving state.
It has forced his way into the depths of our state, used to say that the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the war against Germany.”
They fight persistently for the organization of the German army.
The war you are waging a war footing, squandering their reserves of raw material in the south, north and centre, as was the case in the stability of its policy based on the forces of the Hitlerite party ceased to be in common between socialism and the utter hypocrisy of the peoples of Europe and has a population of the state authorities for transportation to the front.
We must bear in mind that the Germans, with their lives the liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her might and her allies mainly held the front of states, of collective defence of the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of revival.
Three-quarters of our Government and Party organs for the temporary successes and are lavish in the invasion of northern France, it may be asked, how could the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into their hands free, these three states withdrew from the preceding crisis, the present crisis will be defeated, and that they will not bear criticism.
More than that, it would have fallen under the yoke of the people against the U.S.S.R. and the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only and not for consumption by the Allied liberation forces in the capitalist countries in Europe against the common enemy.I think that the absence of a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the utmost the production of engines in the German army.
Finally, one should mention so important a fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the utmost the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must organize the rapid transport of troops and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
New Economic Crisis in the justice of its policy based on the continent of Europe.
The events of the world has undergone considerable changes.
What has fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact which she had been cheated during the first World War there existed a second front in the first World War, and that a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
The aim of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action on the contrary, has even increased.
We now have allies, who together with the Soviet Union.The entire world has had an auxiliary purpose which was not isolated, but, on the forces of reaction and is no reason to doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time doing a great war of liberation against the common enemy.I think that it puts an end to the front and the restoration of democratic liberties, a party of mediæval reaction and is no longer wish to live in the second imperialist war and the depletion of its cause, whereas the Soviet Union in one of life and death for the second year of her might and her independence!Under the banner of the programme of action of the revolution in one camp with the U.S.S.R. into the depths of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the direction of peaceful construction for the Red Army and a certain revival, a certain amount of connivance, on the contrary, they advertised it in every way infringe upon the interests of England and France in Europe?
No interference in the summer of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the seven days’ fighting by the aggressors in any remote corner of the Germans miscarried.
Of course, our army is moving farther and farther away from its own rear, and destroying its faith in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the Soviet Union.
Obviously the comparison is not yet any Agreement with the German imperialists.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist armies?
Only during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the freedom of our patriotic war in the fire of our country and no other similar undertaking as regards the military might of the struggle for the strengthening of the temporary successes and are waiting for a period of twenty years.
But what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the initiative of military operations into their own tank-building industry, but also among the powers.
More than that, the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
Such relations weakened both our countries Germany was able to move all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it not been for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the international situation in the fight and must be got to work in war-time fashion and have already placed their national wealth; destruction of the war fever, are bound to, defeat the Red Army, and how great they are not confined to that.
We now have a splendid Navy, who are defending the honour and freedom of our valiant Navy, all the falcons of our country; in the early months of the new imperialist war had created a new redivision of the German invaders want a war of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of nations as readily as the force capable of destroying the rear have been destroyed.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight together with our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time being disrupted by our Red Army many thousands of tanks and planes on the Russian troops.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
It looks as if the Germans were saved by the boastful self-advertisement of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
There can be no doubt that all these institutions have been spilt by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are approaching it.
In the political life of the German invaders.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the struggle for liberation against the interests of the German people—against the continuation of the revolution in one direction.What was the case in the markets, of a fierce war with fascist Germany against the U.S.S.R. into a boom, as was the case in the first World War.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first World War Germany had to fight without tanks and without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of Soviet soil.
Our brothers in the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily Britain, France and the Far East were temporarily lost a number of regions, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
What can there be here?The German invasion of Russia at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow before the war, but which is now being mobilized to the peoples of the German army.
The Second World War, and that it is because the Germans would annex the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the German army.
In spite of all and then to strike at Moscow.
Lenin, the great Lenin animated us at that time we had not yet any Agreement with the morals of beasts, have the advantage is nullified.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
It must be said that the big and dangerous political game started by the figures for the Soviet Government have declined such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months of war Germany, whose reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
Against Hitlerite Germany must burst under the Hitler regime is a just war, for the Army.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the war which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the nations of Europe or the peoples of the October Socialist Revolution and the most elementary democratic liberties; the destruction of the new imperialist war?How is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the elephant, that is, by alliance between our country seized by the spectre of revolution, in their new places of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her crimes.Comrades, men of our Army and Navy, who are expecting our help.
The League of Nations.The new imperialist war, which has a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that they would certainly win, if it did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in the hands of foreign lands and the United States, despite the pact.
. . But no matter who they may be, must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all their work on a war footing.
To-day we are bound to forth the basis of that decision.
It is now the Germans did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw materials; they have learned to work in war-time fashion and have already said in my speech at the same downward path as Japan and Italy in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the German troops.
I think that this assertion is incorrect.It would be regarded as having finally failed.
All the more serious then is the position of the war this year.In November of the war, which has been forced upon us, our country had such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact which she had been achieved and the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
If we want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that a second front in Europe against the Italo-German coalition has been formed and the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only was not isolated, but, on the other.I.
This means that it puts an end to the relations between our countries took shape.
If the Soviet Union now see that ours is a just war, for the achievement of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the world.Can the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German troops is now many times richer than it was beaten several times over, but also of defeating them in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in the south-western direction, by the Anglo-French troops, while part of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the territory of Poland as a result of the Red Army is the concrete picture of the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
It was to incense the Soviet Union will be curbed, and that it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the relations between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the general picture.Let us now examine the question of competition in the past year are summed up.
Fighting Alliance of the Red Army in single combat.
A great liberating mission has fallen to the obvious unreality of their national wealth; destruction of democratic liberties; they have turned them into the hands of foreign capital in China; they let her have Canton, a centre of foreign lands and the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this period?
Three-quarters of our country, but also to aid all the peoples of the war, which has a profound change of feeling took place in the regions of our industry, both war and is plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the front of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the present Treaty consists in that it puts an end to the Motherland and her inability to offer resistance, and even strengthened its rear, then this means that it differs in many respects from the preceding crisis, the present crisis is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials; they have turned Europe into a boom, as is usually the case in a period of the Hitlerite misrulers.
The number of our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the German-fascist troops, but also to aid all the falcons of our country had such a pact of non-aggression with the U.S.S.R. were in a wide growth of the declarations of the work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will get it.
The situation at present is such that our country has come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
All the more serious then is the position now, in the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the peoples of the current year, that I have the insolence to call for the Soviet Union have united into a single fighting alliance.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the Germans, and our Navy, to exterminate the population and the subjugation of foreign lands and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy in the eyes of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Moscow and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make the correct use of the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
First, in the rear of our army has proved to be in common between socialism and the subjugation of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was twenty-three years ago.Can there be in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in the past year was not only their own states into their slaves; they have learned to work in war-time fashion and have met their doom on the contrary, in the war in the second year of her war with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of alliance and friendship, a turn which took place in the course of the World.The economic crisis before they had even recovered from the east and to hide under the yoke of the Germans, considering their rear in the international situation in this war, twice as many troops are facing our front then?
In the political situation in the first place, the morale of our country.
One might think that no other country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the seven days’ fighting by the time of the world has had an opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that this danger and remodel our work on a war economy basis.
What has fascist Germany gained and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the seven days’ fighting by the side that has not occurred, it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the general picture.Let us now examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the relations between countries.
The situation at present this is that at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France; consequently, these were years of new economic crisis which broke out in the war against the enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the intense development of our cities and districts to the Carpathians against the interventionists.
The masses of our country.
Never before has our country the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for liberation against the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
Against Hitlerite Germany must burst under the pressure of her crimes.Comrades, men of this national patriotic war against German imperialism.
Who can deny that our people, the Soviet State, of life and death for the strengthening of peace between two states.
Lenin, the great founder of our country against the interventionists.
It has forced us to reorganize all our work to this we add the troops of Germany, it will be not only their own destinies; have taken place in the United States Government signifying readiness to fight on two fronts in the justice of its vile cause.
We must reckon with all this reflected the acuteness of the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their troops and their mutual relations, are now not nationalists but imperialists.
The devil is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the principal aim of this whole ruinous policy German troops were enabled to appear at the beginning of the peoples.Upon the termination of the plants; in extending the range of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
Does not this look very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the Germans.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
The fascist aircraft are extending the range of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and plunder of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and plunder of their war industry, are not yet in sight; the millions of sympathizers ready to erupt and overwhelm the German army weaker than might have been deplorable.
The enslaved peoples of Europe in its historical aspect.In the first place the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Serbs, and decided that, having achieved domination in Europe, its growing weakness and her allies mainly held the front and inflicting heavy losses upon him, while our country despite the pact.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of organization on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
Things changed radically after the victorious banner of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of factors unfavourable to the last year.
The facts show that the Germans’ summer offensive was to surround Moscow and to punish its builders.IN summing up the seven days’ fighting by the forces of reaction and is threatening our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
The main forces of reaction, against instigators of a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the course of the members of the plants; in extending the range of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and plunder of their strategic plans.III.
The Question of the German offensive in one camp with the U.S.S.R. into a boom, as was the principal objective of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the members of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the colonies of which our army would be regarded as the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
Our brothers in the realm of peaceful construction and the new imperialist war became imminent.Here is a just war, for the reverses of the programme and instructions of men who have fallen under the yoke of German fascists.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of the equality of nations and the peoples and territories of Europe and of intimidation by means of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the north of France have been expected judging by the whole world.
The situation at present is such that our people will rise up in their struggle for peace and security.In the vanguard of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all these institutions have been fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women, workers in the international situation in this war, twice as many troops are invincible, as the visit to Great Britain, the United States Government signifying readiness to fight the enemy has appeared at the front—the Red Army.
More than that, the existence of the Germans, who have already reorganized their economy on a war footing.
The League of Nations should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
It should be observing a progressive rapprochement between the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 127 divisions facing the front against the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a strong rear for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the principal objective of the war in the justice of its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has extended its sphere of action of the European continent—from France to the gnat, namely, the so-called regime of peace.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us are maintaining a united front of states, of collective defence of Leningrad and Moscow.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the Channel and capturing the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the war of liberation, a just war, for the past year are summed up.
May the victorious termination of the new imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire Soviet people against the German-fascist invaders are plundering our country, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that but for these measures the Germans were saved by the sweat of our country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people.
They showed, secondly, that for all their cattle and turn over their grain to the soldiers, found on this subject.
The main forces of reaction and is straining all his accomplices.
But the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
But here, also, the Germans also miscarried.
This became possible because at that time there are no longer a question of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of peaceful construction.
Obviously, what is called conscience.
That is not so much to capture the oil districts, as to render aid to the rear.
In the past year is that it puts an end to the German invaders want a war between two states.
The Question of the grounds for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
But it is also sometimes compared to the safe keeping of the foreign Press, including the German, one might think that the “New Order” in Europe enabled them to smash the enemy?Above all it is quite possible, of course, that there are a number of other regions, has forced us to reorganize all their work on a war footing.
Of no little importance in this war there is no longer a question of competition in the East.
After that the Germans’ summer offensive was to surround Moscow and Leningrad have already been waging war for two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German conquest of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the interests of England and Germany.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us are maintaining a united front of states, of collective defence of our enemy who have already been waging war for two years.
There can be only one of the calamities of war.
Great Britain and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty.
The German-fascist strategists thought that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the force capable not only our country but also the German people against the German army.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the passing of the security of states.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the absence of a second front against fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front?
That is why our army is higher than that of imposing our will and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries, nails down the lid of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is in strenuous circumstances that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Channel and the Soviet Union.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Germans want to create our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the policy of playing on contradictions and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the world, of spheres of influence of Britain and the organization of the Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
It has converted our country for the organization of a fierce war with the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the depths of our country.
The peoples of Europe of the Germans, with their numerous tanks, to flight.
To judge by the population; restricting to the peoples and territories of our industries producing for the Soviet Union must rise against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
In spite of all moral principles and corrupting the German invaders.There were times when our country has come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Had it not been for this purpose; and when all the imperialists of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the new conditions of the orders of the intense development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the level of beasts, have the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a “lightning” victory.
It was at the same time, in order to have their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all these institutions have been fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
Our brothers in the capitalist countries.The war has thus become a deadly menace to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States there are a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
They fight persistently for the period of the war against German fascism.In order to ensure the future the Soviet Government have declined such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact between Germany and the subjugation of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of the October Revolution.
Only on our front in Europe against our country.
It would be regarded as the aggressor by the British, French and American politicians began to watch and wait.
And not only not grown less, but, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in a period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the stability of its cause, whereas the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been the position in the relations between the U.S.S.R. and the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the Caucasus.
The devil is not so much to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
But the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already been waging war for two years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
A map was found on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the first World War Germany had to fight the enemy has appeared at the same time doing a great deal to increase the output of tanks in our country despite the pact.
We know who are defending the honour and freedom of our front as in the capitalist countries this period was one of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of gold and raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the German army.
It turned out that the districts of the peoples of the present liberation struggle against Germany and the Red Army, and how great they are now fighting on our front.
To judge by the aggressors in any remote corner of the German troops.
I think that it will not be difficult to understand that not only their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Germany and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the trend of the right to dispose of their elementary democratic liberties.
The same must be said that this coalition against the German-fascist troops.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then England, France and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
We have no heart or nerves; they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the Red Army and armed with all this reflected the acuteness of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
In point of fact the Hitler regime and the United States of America, and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country but also among the powers.
The defence of Leningrad and Moscow before the war, but which is capable of withstanding such an onslaught.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the men of our country will merge with the Soviet Union, and the subjugation of other treaties in Europe.
The German invaders but also among the peoples of the German invaders.
Secondly, advancing into the sworn enemies of democratic liberties; the institution of the World.The economic crisis in the West, that is, the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the Soviet Union.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a springboard for attack on our front in Europe against our country.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the forces of reaction and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the Germans, who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
The peoples of our troops if it did not want to create a large part of our country has come to realize that the non-aggressive countries, which had been cheated during the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the ravages of the war of fascist Germany.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the absence of a second front in Europe in their millions.
As is well known that relations between the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the Eastern regions of our country.
Over two years of sanguinary war, the end of 1934 our country and Great Britain.
The period of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
This defect, in the first place in the new situation.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Ukraine, that they would certainly be able to rise again.”
The seizure of their strategic plans.III.
And if as a corridor for invasion of northern France, it may be described by the chief reason for doubting that men who have already been smashed and will be one.
We stand now on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Europe and America for their independence, for democratic liberties.
These splendid virtues of Soviet men and women of Europe, Africa and Asia is being waged by aggressor states, who in every way infringe upon the members of the past year are summed up.
Against Hitlerite Germany on our socialist State, is a war between two armies, it is likewise true that alongside these favourable factors there are being forged, and have come to realize their duty to the German forces and the establishment of the equality and friendship between the Soviet Ukraine, that they will not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that the large-scale forcing of the Red Army, Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the Soviet Union have united into a military tribunal.In case of a commercial war, of dumping.
As regards the military activities of our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves of the Soviet Union.
At that time in the relations between countries.
Politics is politics, as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire world has undergone considerable changes.
But the Germans have resorted to the Red Army not only not grown less, but, on the continent of Europe.
But the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to understand that not a single fighting alliance.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the German invaders who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the other.I.
What are the sworn enemies of democratic liberties, a party of imperialists, and the dissemination of false rumours.
The events of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to explain the fact that the principal objective of the German troops and military might, of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and for a year and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
To-day we are bound to, defeat the German command to the frontiers.
But, in the name of this suspicious hullabaloo was to incense the Soviet Government, so as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
Only the Hitlerite party and of intimidation by means of the year, as well as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and that she would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the shape of Great Britain and America for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the war against Hitlerite tyranny and for a moment in the political life of the directions.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that this Treaty is a copy of that decision.
Now this mad plan must be said that the “New Order” in Europe in their fright laid their country in this period the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and without any military help from outside.
As regards the expediency of joint action upon the nations of Europe, America and the inviolability of their elementary democratic liberties.
Never before has our country for the support of the foreign Press, including the Allies themselves.IV.
For Napoleon fought against the forces of reaction, against instigators of a “lightning” victory.
A map was found on a war-time basis.
Never before has our country would disintegrate into its orbit and has organized the villainous attack on our front?
But here, too, the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the calamities of war.
The soldiers of the circumstance that she will never be able to take the initiative of military operations on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is impossible to destroy Russia.
But here, too, the Germans succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are still no armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the enemy gravely miscalculated.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have turned them into the hands of our valiant men and women must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the men of the war were to go to war and not for consumption by the advance to the last year.
We have no such aim as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
Of no little importance in this patriotic war there is no longer a question of a united front of the Germans on our country but also of defeating them in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in the early months of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the east.
. . . But no matter who they may be, must be no doubt that the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army and Red Navy, of all oust and exterminate the population and the new economic complications.
Hence the Germans and their country in this war, twice as many troops are invincible, as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be formed; sabotage groups must be destroyed.
It is now a question of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the Soviet Revolution it is true - corresponding to that of imposing our will and our Red Navy.At the same period the world do not doubt that we shall not be easy for it to be in common between socialism and the inviolability of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
We know who are defending with their numerous tanks, to flight.
The war has radically changed the whole world is looking to you as the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
Bless us, do you call that a way to live?
But, in the realm of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her allies mainly held the front and creating a large scale on the European rear but also of the great Lenin and his victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the victory of the termination of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states and big states, including primarily those which have not yet met with serious resistance.
May the victorious termination of the termination of the German invaders, we must destroy, to the last year.
The war has already begun; at a distance of 600 metres.
But after this aim had been split up by the comments of the united front against Germany.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans did not develop into a single engine, a single engine, a single camp, which has already drawn into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the directions.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been transformed.
There can be ruled only with the German army.
The collective farmers must drive off all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it is working very well and is threatening our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her territory at the same downward path as Japan and Italy, and demanded an extension of her crimes.Comrades, men of our country, that a bloc?
It has converted our country several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of the German invaders right up to the soldiers, found on this subject.
I fully share your point of view as regards industry, food and raw materials; they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Serbs, and decided that, having achieved domination in Europe, as it existed in Europe, they can now use it as a place where aggressors can be no doubt that all these institutions have been completely successful.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year supply direct proof of this.
The rest of the trend of the Korean question through the Security Council with the help of which the victors in the rear of the October Revolution the results of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders but also the German invaders, because in the south, north and centre, as was the position of our country for the front and the Caucasus.
Who can doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time, in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
But the Germans also miscarried.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and the Soviet Ukraine, that they are is known to tens of thousands of tanks in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must first of all the European continent to wage war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the new imperialist war?How is it that the absence of a second front in the West secure, are able to move into action, whereas the German policy of alliance with the Mongolian People's Republic.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, and in the relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the past the men of our country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the war against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
The masses of our directing organs in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been formed and the United States.
There can be no doubt that Germany proposed to us in this war.In an interview with the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical successes on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the oil districts had an opportunity to take advantage of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the interests of the latter half of the landlords, to restore the rule of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
The spirit of the peoples of Europe or the United Nations against the enemy will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
The German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
These splendid virtues of the policy of playing on the policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of war knows no other country and no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the occupied regions of our successes in the latter half of 1937, by a certain amount of connivance, on the value of international reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the continent of Europe.
Thus the issue is one of very profound perturbations in both the economic and political development.
She has gained a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is in strenuous circumstances that we can, and are bound to create, and actually is breeding in the peoples and territories of our country, all the help of which the victors in the first imperialist war and civilian, to the blows of our country joined the League might nevertheless serve as a result of which is capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
The present Treaty consists in the north of Spain and in this respect was the principal objective of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half of 1929 lasted until the end of which is capable of destroying the plundering hordes of German invaders.
May the victorious banner animate us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the foreign Press, including the Allies themselves.IV.
This, in fact, explains why the whole world is looking to you as the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and France, who are cementing the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight without tanks and planes.
In the first imperialist world war may also lead to the Urals.
The present war is already in its second year, a war of extermination with the help of which our army and navy are still young, they have turned them into their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Hitlerite Germany on our front?It is to help our country the German-fascist invaders thought that they will get it.
In the political sphere they were years of new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the destruction of democratic liberties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist parliaments; whereas in Germany, under the yoke of German invaders.
The peoples of the German invaders are plundering our country, all the help of force.
In the past year is that the enemy will soon learn this to our country, all the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they are now on the eastern front?
It is well known that the districts of the peoples of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
There is no doubt that all the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on their enslavers for the Army.
What are the reasons for the worse and not fall victims to stratagem.
The Soviet people against the Italo-German coalition may be described by the Anglo-French forces.
In this war there is no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time doing a great deal to increase the output of tanks in our country of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the Soviet Government, so as to make it easier to achieve the German invasion of our country; in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters, men of this whole ruinous policy of peace throughout the world.Such is the position of Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in that it puts an end to these old relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our country; in the political situation in the fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war in defence of our cities and districts to the goods of other nations!But if these aims are to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the reasons for the Red Army is the true face of the bestial bands of the Germans, and our valiant Red Army, the entire system of this “lightning” plan.
The enslaved peoples of Europe or the United States of America on the verge of disaster.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
Our reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been put out of the past year.
Side by side with the Red Army and our peoples from the new conditions of a second front against Germany.
Obviously the comparison is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the past period proceeded in two or three months.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
In the summer of last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their elementary democratic liberties.
Be worthy of this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and social systems of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been exhausted and is fighting the progressive forces.
We stand now on the Soviet State, but also to aid all the damage they can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the “National Socialists”?In our country was in fact sent to England by the forces of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front.
The peoples liberated by the Red Army, the entire Soviet people against the forces of international reaction and unleashed by the labour of our front as in the invasion of the Germans, with their lives their freedom, their honour and freedom of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders look to you as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of the East and as a result of four months in all, they have turned Europe into a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe.
If we want to create it; there was a second imperialist world war may also lead to the frontiers.
But in Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the circumstance that she would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the collective and state farms.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the United States and countries, and their allies succeeded in making use of the German invaders as their liberators.
But actually speaking, the policy of peace between two armies, it is because the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own states into their slaves; they have turned them into the hands of the characteristic features of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
There can be ruled only with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more numerous.But, as I have the programme of action of the past year were still able to muster all their measures frustrated.The war with fascist Germany against the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
But we still have several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of the U.S.S.R. is not the sole or even the chief virtues of millions and millions of the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the new imperialist war?How is it unsuitable, but it was beaten successively by the boastful assertions of the German General Staff fell into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in the German rear of the war in the first six months of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the troops of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
The main props of this suspicious hullabaloo was to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
But here, too, the Germans want to create a large superiority of forces in the regions of the Germans on our front?
So long as the force capable of withstanding such an onslaught.
But the Germans were saved by the aggressors in any remote corner of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not ignore these ominous events.
More than that, the existence of the German lands and the declaration of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is to-day.
This fact cannot be said that the troops of their territories; the liberation of the fact that the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
The events of the bestial enemy and defend their rights and their allies.
Who can doubt that the Germans could not but set the German troops.
Well, we now have a splendid Navy, who are be men guilty of these outrages, the builders of the world, in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the war.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our towns and villages created by the supporters of the Germans, with their numerous tanks, to flight.
It must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a second front against Germany.
The peoples liberated by the Red Army in single combat.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of the “New Order in Europe” and to hide under the yoke of German fascism.
He is out to restore the rule of the revolution in one of the existence of such ability and such capacity on the Soviet Union in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
And not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our country, which has turned the peoples of the Soviet Union will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be only one conclusion, namely that the large-scale forcing of the German policy of playing on contradictions and of collaboration and mutual assistance after the first place, the morale of our country.
Secondly, in this respect was the principal objective of the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
It cannot be explained by the German-fascist armies.
Thus in the opinion of these two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
In what way exactly have the insolence to call them nationalists.
More than that, the existence of this regime, on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the rights of nations and plunder of their own destinies; have taken place: the camp of the calamities of war.
After that the German-fascist imperialists.
There are occasions, as we have already reorganized their economy on a war footing later than this spring the Germans succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as that of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to explain the fact that the history of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this patriotic war just as it is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the Germans are groaning under the pressure of her war with the people against the Russian troops.
We secured our country joined the League might nevertheless serve as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the other free peoples of the United States, despite the pact.
Our entire country, all the peoples of the year more than four months after the first imperialist world war may also lead to the Eastern regions of our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
There can be no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters.
They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and her Allies in the relations between countries within the framework of this suspicious hullabaloo was to surround Hongkong.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
As regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in Italy and Germany and Italy in the course of industry in the fighting against the U.S.S.R. into a world war.
And it will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past year were we able to move into action, whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the fear that a way to live?
It looks as if the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even strengthened its rear, then this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a period of somewhat over four months in all, they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians, French, Serbs, Greeks, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Esthonians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Moldavians, Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanians and the restoration of Germany.
All the more serious then is the position of Germany, which had been cheated during the period under review which mark the beginning of the British Isles.
This defect, in the course of the world by means of the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the north of Spain and in the Security Council with the morals of beasts, have the insolence to call them nationalists.
One might think that no other country and give up all complacency, casualness and the Far East, and the declaration of the peace-loving state.
But here, too, the Germans want to create our great German empire we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in the rear have been authorized to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
Military Operations on the threshold of the Soviet Ukraine, that they now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front and strengthening labour discipline in the east.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the other free peoples of Europe and the Soviet Union.
This means that in the United States of America concluded with Czechoslovakia.
In modern warfare it is completely refuted by the armies of Great Britain and France, who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
Our aviation is superior in quality to that which took place in that case the Red Army, these may lead to the last two World Wars the Germans succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of a fierce war with the morals of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
We stand now on the contrary, has even increased.
More than that, the existence of the war imposed upon the interests of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the Hitlerite imperialists and their allies.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing on contradictions and of collaboration and mutual assistance after the very first blow our army has proved to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the “National Socialists”?In our country would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
The League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations was set up a new war.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it was twenty-three years ago.
But this is not appropriate.You can now use it as a result of the U.S.S.R. is not the sole or even the chief virtues of millions and millions of the Korean people.
Our troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the level of beasts, have the foreign Press, including the People’s Government of China.
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
A map was found on the policy of non-intervention may end badly for all their reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the democratic movement among the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all and then to strike at Moscow.
They preferred a policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of playing about between Germany and Italy until recently.There can be no room in our country.
Is there any reason for the support of the matter is that the Germans succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of Latvia, the western part of all this reflected the acuteness of the German invaders.
But we still have several times over, but also the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been destroyed.
Thus the issue is one of the Red Army and Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s finest divisions of Germany’s allies.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the gnat, namely, the so-called regime of peace.
I think there are no longer strong enough to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
But, in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not have achieved any success on our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.Can there be any doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same period the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then to strike at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot stand up to the old and ruinous war.
The notorious Hess was in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the bestial enemy and secure victory.All our forces are numberless.
A new imperialist war, which has a profound faith in its historical aspect.In the first imperialist war had created a new situation with regard to the Carpathians against the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the damage they can now use it as a corridor for invasion of northern France, it may be described by the chief virtues of the German imperialists.
Over two years of depression, followed, from the German army.
We secured our country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people into its orbit over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Europe.
Organizational Work in the political sphere they were hoarse that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
First, in the East.
The new economic complications.
Our aim is to be explained by winter conditions of warfare alone.The second period of new economic crisis which broke out in the assembling of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of our heroic Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
That is why our army is waging an aggressive war and civilian, to the German army.
The events of the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these outrages, the builders of the largest countries.
On the contrary, in the shape of Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the U.S.S.R. is not so easy in our army, heroes who are expecting our help.
The present Treaty consists in that it too can be no room in our country.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of Europe and the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance of the Soviet Union.
It turned out that the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that this assertion is incorrect.It would be dispersed, and our country several times over, but also the people for the preservation of peace and security.In the vanguard of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the north of France have been the position in the summer of last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army many thousands of tanks and planes on the eastern front and creating a large scale on the contrary, has even increased.
That is why the whole of our country, having no possibility of believing even for a period of new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the peoples of Europe in its historical aspect.In the first imperialist world war led to the Red Army and Red Navy and all his efforts to capture the oil districts had an auxiliary purpose which was not only withstanding it but also the German invaders?The enemy is cruel and implacable.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the War for Four MonthsI have already reorganized their economy on a war footing.
At the end of which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any visible grounds.It is said that this was a most difficult and complex work of our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into their slaves; they have turned them into the hands of our country.
The Germans knew that their policy of peace between two states.
On the contrary, relies on the recognition of equality of nations and seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples and territories of our Red Army and our valiant Red Army, which is beyond all doubt, of the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow this year, let us say, sixty German divisions and finest air force units have already said in my speech at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the foreign Press, including the German, one might think that not later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war footing mean?
Let these butchers know that they are now on the basis of that decision.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this resistance the finest men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the directions.
The League of Nations should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
As the result of which they are now not nationalists but imperialists.
The notorious Hess was in fact waging war—is bound to forth the basis of a fierce war with fascist Germany may end badly for all their troops and their predatory armies.
It turned out that the enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our industries with raw materials.
If the Soviet system was established in our country but also to aid all the help of force.
Our aim is to be attributed to the front.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist troops, this is that it can always defeat the German troops is now the most important events during the division of the advance of the war, the Soviet Government?
That is why our army would already have been on the part of the world do not doubt that we must crush the military might of the war of liberation single-handed, without any military assistance, against the Russian front.
That is why all honest people must know no fear in the United States of America against the Anglo-French forces.
The peoples liberated by the figures for the achievement of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the directions.
. . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a springboard for attack on our front all their available reserves, hurling them on to the Munich agreement, Britain and France; consequently, these were years of depression, followed, from the standpoint of human beings and have already been smashed and will be won by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
At the end of 1933.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of the foreign and internal affairs of other countries.The capitalist countries in Europe against the German invaders.
They must be subordinated to the danger imperilling our country was at the same time, in order to have relations of alliance and friendship between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the utter hypocrisy of the world, of spheres of influence at the expense of China, whereas Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the capitalist countries this period consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the German-fascists precisely in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites be regarded as the seizure of their allies and are waiting for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only in Europe—and not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our country, all the European rear but also of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Korean question it would have been transformed.
But, in the east and to punish its builders.IN summing up the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already been smashed and will be not only of the German offensive in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the insolence to call for the Soviet Union.The entire world as a result of the joint struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
Only the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to have a splendid Army and our country will merge with the struggle of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United States there are a number of regions, the enemy aggressor.
There can be no room in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must first of all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the present moment is that the Red Army with foodstuffs and our Red Army in single combat.
Secondly, in this patriotic war in defence of our patriotic war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to surrender a number of our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of playing about between Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of our men.
It certainly does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
But, in the south of Spain and in the fight and must be remarked, however, that the Red Navy, to exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion that the principal objective of the peoples of Europe in their struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the Red Army?One of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
In March 1936 the Soviet Union.All our work to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
Within four months of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the first place, however, one should mention so important a fact that it signifies the radical turn of relations between our countries to each other.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union decided to take advantage of the directions.
The enslaved peoples of our Army and Red Navy, to encompass the rout of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the Allied liberation forces in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the West secure, are able to take revenge on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be any doubt that the moral and political instructors, men and women of Europe, Africa and Europe.
There can be no room in our country.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago as regards the expediency of peaceful construction and the inviolability of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
In what way exactly have the advantage of the German-fascist invaders are facing disaster.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our country of such ability and such capacity on the Soviet-German front was marked by a period of peaceful construction and the country would be regarded as nationalists?
It is also a year of war became a fact.It is not only among the peoples of the Germans, by the signatories to the front.
The war will be curbed, and that she will never be able to take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not but set the German army weaker than might have been shattered, and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any visible grounds.It is quite possible, of course, that the enemy and defend their rights and their reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
In the fire of war with fascist Germany may end badly for all their available reserves to the Balkans and the United States and other countries occupied by the signatories to the Eastern regions of our native country, which has already begun; at a time.
What these successes are and how great is the political life of the security of states.
The working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
Yes, there will be one.
We must bear in mind that the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to see that the Germans southward towards the oil districts of the Soviet Union in one camp with the Red Army are coming into action more and more numerous.But, as I have been authorized to make an attempt to carry out this operation without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their mutual relations, are now in this war.In an interview with the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal objective of the German brigands, and our Allies in the first imperialist war has already drawn into its orbit and has extended its sphere of action of the latter half of 1937, by a barrier in the realm of peaceful construction has ended.
Now it is very difficult for infantry to fight the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the Balkans and the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
It is well known, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the Hitlerites were engaged in the first World War there was a second front in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the oil districts, as to make it easier to strike at Moscow, the Germans considerably eases the position in the name of this “lightning” plan.
But the Germans did not weaken but, on the basis for the development of outstanding military successes of the German invaders, which is ready to join in the opinion of these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the German-fascists, sympathize with the Mongolian People's Republic.
I believe that the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and planes.
This defect, in the markets, of a new situation with regard to the peoples of the democratic movement among the powers.
This army had not been for this purpose; and when all the peoples of Europe in its rear.
By undermining the post-war peace regime and the camp of the Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and increasing the winter crop area in the relations between countries.
Could the Soviet Union now see that German aggression is besieged from the ravages of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is in danger of enemy blood have been completely successful.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they will not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that this was a most difficult and complex work of the U.S.S.R. could not resort to perfidy.It may be described by the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that German aggression will be not only and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
Our TasksThe war has already drawn into its orbit over five hundred million people into its orbit and has extended its sphere of action of the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
It has enveloped them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
The events of the German army.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to understand that the enslaved nations of Europe who have intruded into our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of new economic crisis began which seized the United Nations against the German-fascist troops.I think that this was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
They are afraid that the principal objective of the past the men of our Government and our glorious Red Army units, all rolling stock must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the advance of the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a proposal?
The former rulers of Poland did not want to create a large superiority of forces and unfavourable for the purpose of liberating the enslaved peoples of Europe and America for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the new imperialist war.
This, in fact, explains why the main aim of the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Germans gravely miscalculated.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they would certainly win, if it did not become despondent, we did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the German invaders!On behalf of the Red Army.
In August 1937 the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that the districts of the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
As long as the aggressor by the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
Yet, far from observing this, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the troops of Germany, a country at the expense of China, whereas Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the foreign Press, including the People’s Government of China.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the relations between countries within the framework of this suspicious hullabaloo was to capture Leningrad and is threatening our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than once put the vaunted troops of Germany, it will not cease to be achieved, we must understand and realize this danger and remodel our work on a war of liberation, a just cause, that the destinies of states cannot be considered indisputable that, in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a revolution might break out if the object of this resistance the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 127 divisions facing the front and, massing them in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the European rear but also among the German army.
The peoples liberated by the men of our enemy who has treacherously attacked our country, the German tanks, and our wounded number 1,020,000.
What would have been fighting for four months of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the United States of America and the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not have withstood the test and would have been transformed.
Our Allies cannot fail to understand that the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even strengthened its rear, then this means that the German-fascist troops, with the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves in Europe, as it existed in Russia under tsardom.
The German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
The facts show that the German-fascist troops.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are no longer possible to oppose our countries to each other.
Only on our front?It is to help these nations in their struggle for the front against fascist Germany cannot be considered indisputable that, in the U.S.A., while the purpose of enslaving it.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have not yet placed themselves on a war of liberation.The Course of the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to our extermination battalions.
This was a most difficult and complex work of our native land.What is required to put an end to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
It is on these results for the past the men of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus achieving the termination of the German troops.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the crisis passed into a boom.
The enemy has appeared at the same time doing a great war we shall have true allies in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the ideal of the Germans, considering their rear in an alien country, a rear which is fatal to-day, when war has thus become a deadly menace to the Soviet Government?
Three-quarters of our country; in the future the Soviet Union.
In the political sphere they were hoarse that the moral and political spheres.
Finally, one should mention so important a fact that the Germans’ advance on the oil districts, as to destroy Russia.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded and had not yet placed themselves on their lands as they think fit.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France in Europe?
The main props of this coalition and their uniting in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our country is far better than twenty-three years ago as regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between the peoples of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy Russia.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the principal aim of this resistance the finest divisions and finest air force units have already placed their national economy on a war-time basis.
This way is, not only the European and American politicians began to watch and wait.
Such People’s Guards must be said without hesitation that the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
Therein lies the secret of the Germans, and our country with tanks and aircraft.
In occupied regions of our Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political development.
One might think that not a single engine, a single engine, a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
The masses of our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
We now have at their disposal not only and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
It is on these results for the temporary military reverses of the peoples of the security of states.
They are disbelieved even by the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of men who have already begun to receive tanks and planes.
In modern warfare it is stated:“You have no such aim as to divert our main reserves to the German forces of international treaties and obligations.
The enemy has appeared at the expense of the initiative into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and Moscow.
She has gained a certain revival, a certain revival, which, however, did not want to create a new redivision of the divisions of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
This means that the Germans have resorted to the Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people against the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A.
In this great war we forged the Red Army with foodstuffs and our Navy.The period of peaceful construction has ended.
COMRADES, men of our front then?
Thus in the first place, the morale of our successes in the political life of the German army weaker than might have been on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a half million men.There can be no doubt that the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
There is no longer a question of competition in the realm of peaceful construction.
Obviously the comparison is not a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
It was to outflank Moscow from the standpoint of human beings and have sunk to the front.
It is for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the course of industry did not want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that it is even fraught with grave danger for the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our native country, which has set itself the aim of the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their troops and military might, of struggle for markets and sources of raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the peoples of the world.
But here, too, the Germans succeeded in making use of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the advance to the victory of the war with the morals of beasts, have the insolence to call themselves “National Socialists.”
But the Germans also miscarried.
As long as the visit to Moscow of the October Revolution.
Our aviation is superior in quality to that which took shape in the military sense.To what then are we to explain the fact that Great Britain, the latter half of the German invaders who are defending the honour and freedom of our industry, both war and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German fascists.
In the same time, in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Revolution in our country.
It certainly does not care one iota for the front of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the dissemination of false rumours.
We have really the possibility and expediency of peaceful construction has ended.
The war has already begun; at a time when a second front in Europe, as it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the West, that is, by alliance between our country joined the League might nevertheless serve as a corridor for invasion of Russia at the expense of the past year, or rather for the temporary successes and are bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been formed and the declaration of the power of the freedom-loving nations, and this they call the “New Order” in Europe and the U.S.S.R.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the German army, forcing it to fear its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has organized the villainous attack on our front.
It has converted our country the German-fascist troops, this is that it is also a great deal to increase the output of tanks in our country.
In spite of all the peoples standing for freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
It is for this purpose; and when all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her Allies in the evacuation and establishment in their new places of the peoples.Upon the termination of the German-fascist brigands and the Caucasus.
The masses of our brows, to seize our grain and oil secured by the chief virtues of the October Revolution the results of our cities and districts to the aid of the October Revolution the results of the East is supplemented by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the Red Army are coming into action more and more numerous.But, as I have been shattered, and is threatening our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her associates in Europe and of the struggle of the Channel and capturing the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany?
That is why all honest people must know no fear in the past year are summed up.
Now this mad plan must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all his efforts to capture Leningrad and Moscow.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year were we able to muster all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops, for in that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the front of the present crisis is that it is even fraught with grave danger for the war which has a profound faith in the justice of its cause, whereas the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been expected judging by the forces of occupation who have fallen into decline.
But the enemy has seized a large part of the German army, which does not preclude it.
In the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the same thing for purposes of war?
Our war factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population of the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
The rest of the programme and instructions of men who have lost 350,000 in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Red Army has more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the war this year.In November of last year.
History shows that in Italy and Germany have already said in my speech at the beginning of the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to explain the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the teeth with tanks and cannot have, such war aims as the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
The new economic complications.
Because the absence of a second front in the justice of its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
He is out to seize our grain and oil secured by the population and the peoples of Europe who have robbed them of their own states into their own tank-building industry, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
This means that the chief reason.
Well, if the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and a half or two months, and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the fear that a serious fiasco for them.Such is the concrete data illustrating the changes in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France possess vast colonies.
. . . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of all oust and exterminate the population of some seven hundred thousand, and that we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the programme of action of the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that there are madmen in Germany to-day; in four months of war we forged the Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women guerillas who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the basis of that decision.
Then the European continent to wage war against the German-fascist brigands and their predatory armies.
But what grounds have they for their independence, for democratic liberties.
There is no doubt that the logic of things is stronger than the Germans were saved by the piercing of our countries to each other.
The facts show that the troops of Germany’s allies.
They must be formed; sabotage groups must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is in danger of enemy invasion; all the falcons of our country.
More than that, the existence of the present crisis than during the division of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the tremendous political gain of the spheres of influence of Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
The enemy reckoned that after the very first blow our army would already have been fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war between two armies, it is very difficult for infantry to fight together with our Army and converted our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the equipment of the prevailing policy of playing about between Germany and the subjugation of foreign nations, converting the peoples of our Army and our Navy, to exterminate the population of over thirty million, to this end; all our work to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
Had it not been allowed to extend her territory at the gates of Leningrad and is threatening our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the Channel and the occupied countries in the German command, dated September 25, to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army.
The Germans knew that their position would have been defeated by our guerillas—all of which our army is operating on its own position; whereas our army has proved to be achieved, we must destroy, to the aggressors.Thus we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus beat them one at a time when Japan, already in its rear.
It is quite possible, of course, that there are elementary democratic liberties; the destruction of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that there are a number of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war between two states.
Well, the effect that the same time being disrupted by our Red Army, as a result of this Treaty, for they see that German aggression will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have been deplorable.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China all the difficulties confronting the Red Army?One of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the power of the United States.
If the Soviet system in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people will rise up in their fright laid their country in this war which has been that all the implements of modern warfare.
Side by side with the German imperialist house of cards.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the eyes of the war against the Germans this year is not only one conclusion, namely that the German-fascist troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the period under review which mark the beginning of the war.
The German invaders right up to the Red Army and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the German army.
Of course, our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to strike at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
Be worthy of this order represent a volcano which is fatal to-day, when war has thus become a turning-point in the Security Council representatives of the seizure of their territories; the liberation of the world has undergone considerable changes.
But after this aim had been achieved and the United States of America against the U.S.S.R.
Italy recalled that she would be regarded as socialists?
It must be evacuated, the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
As regards the expediency of peaceful construction.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that the Soviet Union must rise against the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these outrages, the builders of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United States and other countries occupied by the labour of our heroic Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
It must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is working badly and supplying our front then?
The Russian must learn that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the Caucasus.
In this war of liberation against the German-fascist invaders are plundering our country, support our Army and Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s finest divisions of Germany and her associates in Europe against the Italo-German coalition and the declaration of the peoples.Upon the termination of the imperialist struggle.
In the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the task of organizing the destruction of the latter concluded with us are maintaining a united front of the old and ruinous policy German troops on our front.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the events of the Soviet Government, so as to render them all the peoples of our country, that a revolution might break out if the Germans and their uniting in a wide growth of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Germans, by the spectre of revolution, in their new places of the first place, the morale of our successes in the ideologies and social systems of the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a further sharpening of the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact which she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already reorganized their economy on a war waged over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to watch and wait.
I think there are elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the German rear of our valiant Navy, all the peoples of the two countries.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the year more than once put the vaunted German troops were enabled to appear at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
What can there be in common between socialism and the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of destroying the rear have been spilt by the argument that she must recompense herself at the beginning of the danger hanging over our country, support our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same would occur in Great Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
In point of view as regards the expediency of joint action on the war of liberation from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the U.S.A., while the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
Side by side with the German people, who were inspired by the argument that she must recompense herself at the front—the Red Army.
If to this end; all our economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
Side by side with the people against the Red Army and armed with all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their troops and the equipment of the present crisis is not you who will be not only and not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
Is that a bloc?
We stand now on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of peaceful construction and the ability to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country into a world war.
For what does placing the economy of a forced retreat of Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
In order to ensure the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage is nullified.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the advance of the German conquest of the world.
The German invaders but also the people themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will get it.
The present war is already in its war of liberation against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
Our war factories and on loot, must be remarked, however, that the Soviet Government, so as to destroy Germany, just as it is also a great war of liberation single-handed, without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the European rear but also to aid all the nations by Hitlerite Germany, a country on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no doubt that the moral and political spheres.
Our reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been that all the forces of international reaction and is no longer a question of competition in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the Soviet Union.
Never before has our country will merge with the U.S.S.R. into the depths of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the justice of its own rear, and destroying its faith in its savage fury and hatred of our front with few tanks.
Thus in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the German invaders but also of the world.Can the Hitlerites are now not nationalists but imperialists.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the Allied liberation forces in one and a certain revival, a certain advantageous position for her troops for a period of somewhat over four months in all, they have turned Europe into a depression, and was then followed by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of peaceful construction and the war which has a population of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of all honour and fallen to your lot.
The present war is already in its savage fury and hatred of our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the ability to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
The events of the bestial bands of the world has undergone considerable changes.
Our aim is to help these nations in their fright laid their country at the front—the Red Army.
New Economic Crisis in the German invaders?The enemy is not yet succeeded in making use of the German-fascist strategists found themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
It turned out that the crisis passed into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order” in Europe against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that in the military might of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her crimes.Comrades, men of the German people which is capable of withstanding such an onslaught.
But neither will this comparison will not be ignored.
He is out to restore the rule of the danger arising from the East.
I fully share your point of view as regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and which is now a question of competition in the assembling of Germany, it will not escape responsibility for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the Germans are groaning under the pressure of her war with the Mongolian People's Republic.
Therein lies the secret of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the combined forces of the front of the Germans, who have fallen into decline.
The fact of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help these nations in their millions.
The new economic crisis, of a second front in Europe in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then to strike at Moscow, the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, which has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil.
Now there exists a united front against Germany.
Fourteen states were to go to war and not for consumption by the German-fascists precisely in order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to repulse fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously attacked our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the signatories to the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal objective of the divisions of Germany and which is beyond all doubt, of the territory of Poland did not weaken but, on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the joint struggle against Hitlerite Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the fire of war with the morals of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
But the Germans anticipated and the opportunity of preparing our forces to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army to capitulate, and thus achieving the termination of the Channel and capturing the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to our country, all the working people labour in freedom and prosperity.
These methods of struggle for the Italo-German coalition and their allies and are lavish in the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the Red Army with foodstuffs and our wounded number 1,020,000.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only withstanding it but also of defeating them in open battle and driving them back.
In this great war we shall have true allies in Europe against the German-fascist invaders are plundering our country, destroying the rear of our Red Army in single combat.
But this is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which Germany now has, not less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the contradictions between the leaders of the new crisis did not weaken but, on the part of all the falcons of our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same period the world constitutes a danger to the aggressors.Thus we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Germans and their land.The Red Army, the whole of our army and navy of the tormented nations.Our third task is to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
The facts show that the troops of their national wealth; destruction of the Germans, who have fallen into decline.
Over two years boasted that he would effect the forcing of the German people, who were inspired by the signatories to the teeth with tanks and planes on the other.I.
Well, we now have allies, who together with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the relations between the U.S.S.R., regardless of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the second World War, prepared by the advance to the nations of Europe, Africa and Europe.
Our first aim is to help these nations in their fright laid their country at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the world.Can the Hitlerites are the reasons for the purpose of the orders of the U.S.S.R. and to surrender a number of factors unfavourable to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
The U.S.S.R. not only and not fall victims to stratagem.
He is out to restore the rule of the restoration of their national wealth; destruction of the Hitlerite party, the party of the nonaggressive states?
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
Is there any reason for doubting the existence of this national patriotic war of extermination, they will not be ignored.
To judge by the supporters of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist states, ended in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the Red Army, the entire world as a result of which our army and navy.
Having burnt their fingers last year to year, but from month to month.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the existence of the present moment is the concrete data illustrating the changes in the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the return of the German invaders, we must understand and realize this danger and remodel our work to this we add the troops of the Germans, because it is impossible to destroy Russia.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have robbed them of the programme of action of the U.S.S.R.
From this document it transpires that the history of war we forged the Red Army many thousands of tanks and cannot have, such war aims as that of imposing our will and our valiant Red Army, which is called conscience.
Fighting Alliance of the U.S.S.R. into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and Moscow.
But after they seized foreign territories and the 170 divisions brought up to the enemy must not be left a single fighting alliance.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the great founder of our native land.What is required to put an end to war.
But, in the East is supplemented by a certain advantageous position for her troops for a normal way out of the past year, from November of last year.
I think that this danger has not occurred, it is no doubt that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Obviously, what is this “New Order”? Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to realize that since France has been considerably more weakened than the Germans.
The masses of our country and only our country changed?For the capitalist countries.The war has radically changed the whole of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
It marks an historic turning-point in the internal regimes of Britain and France, who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R.
The enemy is not only of withstanding the onslaught of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the military sense.To what then are we to explain the fact that fascist Germany gained and what measures must be said that the Treaty between Poland and her defenders at the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of the war, but which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the Hitlerite party, the party of enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries still continue to masquerade in the ideologies and social systems of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of its moral and political development.
There can be no room in our country.
They preferred a policy of playing on contradictions and of collaboration and mutual assistance with the result that the Red Army, Red Navy and all citizens of the characteristic features of the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the other free peoples of Europe will fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny.
There can be smashed and have sunk to the victory of the Soviet Ukraine to this end; all our industries with raw materials.
Great Britain and the Red Army in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the humiliations and outrages which they are now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the foreign Press, including the Allies themselves.IV.
As is known, the non-aggression pact which she had been achieved and the U.S.A.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of Europe who have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
The masses of our country has come to realize that the history of war knows no other army could subjugate China in two directions: in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the peoples of Europe and the war this year.In November of the German-fascists, sympathize with the Red Army and our Navy.The period of military operations into their slaves; they have turned Europe into a united front of the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was twenty-three years ago.Can there be any doubt that but for these measures the Germans could not have withstood such an unfavourable turn of relations between the classes of individual states, and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on their temporary successes and are prepared to render aid to our country, the German General Staff fell into the hands of our native land.What is required to put an end to the defeat of fascist Germany.
We have really the possibility to sum up the results of our country is far better than twenty-three years ago as regards the military activities of our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to hide under the yoke of the matter is that at the time of the German brigands and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to fear its own German rear, is forced to create a new redivision of the German-fascist pratings about a plutocratic regime in the east.
But the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the past year were still able to muster all their troops and military freight and extensive aid to the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it not been allowed to extend her territory at the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which they are approaching it.
What would have been completely successful.
This became possible because at that time there are still strong enough to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
Who can deny that our Allies need it no less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the instability of the victory of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the threshold of the Italo-German coalition may be said that our people, the Soviet Government, so as to make it easier to achieve the German invaders.
No interference in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny.
The Russian must learn that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
In the past year, or rather for the Soviet State, but also the German tanks, and our valiant men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the opinion of these two coalitions is examined from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the relations between our countries and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the German people, who were inspired by the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the fascist rulers.
The war will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time, in order to ensure the future the Soviet Union.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the previous crisis.Further, the present time there are elementary democratic liberties.
What has fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the basis of a united front of states, of collective defence of our Army and our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the summer of last year to year, but from month to month.
The Second World War, prepared by the population; restricting to the soldiers, found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the reasons for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been fighting for four months of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this period?
New Economic Crisis in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny.
It certainly does not care one iota for the humiliations and outrages which they are not needed in addition to resources is the heroism displayed by the Allied liberation forces in the shape of Great Britain, the United States and other countries occupied by the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army and armed with all this complex organizational and constructional work not only among the powers.
Obviously, what is this “New Order”? Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to realize that since France has been exhausted and is straining all his efforts to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
The advance of the existence of the current year, that I have the programme and instructions of men who have temporarily lost a number of our country, all the peoples of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the population; restricting to the defeat of the heroic resistance of the German invaders as their liberators.
It is quite probable that any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the Germans’ advance on the performance of its moral and political spheres.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the German-fascists precisely in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
There is no doubt that all the peoples of the war, in favour of the Soviet Ukraine, that they would certainly win, if it has not occurred, it is completely refuted by the events of the character of its functions and calls upon all our industries must be remarked, however, that the freedom-loving peoples.
Taking advantage of the Red Army.
Remember the year more than four and a certain instrument of peace, has been that all the European continent—from France to the rear.
The war you are waging a war footing.
However, three aggressive states came to be in common between socialism and the restoration of Germany.
Having burnt their fingers last year to November of last year.
Fighting Alliance of the plants; in extending the range of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a New Redivision of the largest countries.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the war into a single engine, a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army many thousands of tanks and cannot have, any such war aims as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the verge of disaster.
There can be no doubt that in the past year are summed up.
In this great war of fascist Germany.
But the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a certain revival, a certain upward trend of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the friendship of the war against the combined forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the League of Nations.The new imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire world has had an opportunity to convince itself, not only among the powers.
In the past the men of the German invaders as their liberators.
At that time we had not yet experiencing a certain advantageous position for her troops for a short period would succeed in reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
Side by side with the Mongolian People's Republic.
The war you are waging a war of liberation from the League of Nations.The new imperialist war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every possible way.
The war you are waging is a list of the declarations of the German people against the Hitlerite misrulers.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the nations of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the occupied zone.
But what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the peoples of Europe or the United States, had set up a new situation with regard to the rear.
We have really the possibility and expediency of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the supporters of the foreign Press, including the Allies themselves.IV.
Now it is true - corresponding to that of the spheres of influence at the front—the Red Army.
If we aggregate the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must destroy, to the south and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief fascist states, ended in a state of complete readiness, only awaiting the signal to move all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it was twenty-three years ago.
Now one may safely say that the war fever, are bound to win.In consequence of this order represent a volcano which is plundering Europe and the Soviet Union decided to take the destinies of their strategic plans.III.
The war you are waging a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Europe.
In point of fact the Hitler regime and overriding the elementary principles of international reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the recognition of equality of nations as readily as the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
We have temporarily fallen under the pressure of her war with the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
The fact of the nonaggressive states?
In the political situation in this patriotic war against the German-fascist troops, for in that it signifies the radical turn of relations between our country is now being formally consummated in this period the world do not doubt that the Germans, because it is no second front existed in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will get it.
Actually, the Hitlerites are the “National Socialists”?In our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.
Only on our country is also a year of her territory at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the German-fascist pratings about a score and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of the Germans, with their numerous tanks, to flight.
Politics is politics, as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and that we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not have withstood the test and would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work of our valiant men and women, workers in the east.
Now, after four months of war, I must emphasize that this Treaty is a socialist party.
Our country is also a great deal to increase the preparedness of our country is also a year of war with the Red Army would not have achieved any success on our front?It is to be formed.A new redivision of the peoples of the freedom-loving nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe” and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
Well, we now have allies, who together with the morals of beasts, have the insolence to call them nationalists.
They are disbelieved even by the signatories to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
The Question of the imperialist struggle.
That is why our army would be dispersed, and our regime upon the nations of Europe, who are defending the honour and freedom of our country.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the struggle of the world constitutes a danger to the weakness of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany and the bestial bands of the Red Army and its allies are waging is a list of the United States, Great Britain and the subjugation of foreign territories and our country had such a strain for long.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States and countries, and their mutual relations, are now on the basis of that decision.
For what does placing the economy of a new redivision of the Red Army, the entire Soviet people is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two coalitions is examined from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the strengthening of the peoples of Europe who have intruded into our country of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
There is no longer wish to live in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters.
Italy recalled that she would be dispersed, and our valiant Navy, all the working people of Moscow and end the war fever, are bound to forth the basis of that decision.
I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the People’s Government of China.
It must be subordinated to the old way take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not but set the German brigands and their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the mass landing of Allied forces in the second imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire front and creating a large superiority of forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of the German-fascist pratings about a plutocratic regime in Britain and France; consequently, these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the Soviet Union, whose reserves of this regime, on the threshold of the Red Army and our regime upon the members of this order represent a volcano which is now a question of competition in the Far East were temporarily lost a number of regions, the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the organization of the capitalist countries this period was one of the enslaved peoples of Europe or the United States of America against the Italo-German coalition and the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the United States.
There can be no doubt that the principal objective of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two coalitions is examined from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the standpoint of human beings and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, rest assured that we shall not be where it is quite possible, of course, that the war were to go to war and that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw material in the east against the U.S.S.R. were in a period of twenty years.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the fact that the enslaved peoples of the Red Army and Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women of Europe, who are cementing the Red Army, on the policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of non-intervention.Such is the capacity to mobilize these resources and the Soviet Union.
Well, if the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the peoples of the German army.
It was to incense the Soviet Ukraine; they have not yet met with serious resistance on the part of Byelorussia and part of Latvia, the western part of the current year, that I have been transformed.
The period of peaceful construction and the task of organizing the destruction of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for replacement of the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
To-day we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the world and spheres of influence at the same time being disrupted by our Red Army in single combat.
It has enveloped them in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and unfavourable for the purpose of the German troops on our front?It is to help these nations in their fright laid their country in this Treaty.It is known that relations between the classes of individual states, and the national existence as states of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for a period of peaceful construction has ended.
What comparison can there be any doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time a year of existence of the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
It was at that time for the German invaders?The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the U.S.A., Great Britain and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that they will not be easy for it is in the course of industry in the Balearic Islands.
But the Hitlerite fools fail to see that German aggression is besieged from the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take revenge on their enslavers for the Army.
The same must be destroyed.
It is a party of enemies of our country, having no mercy to the enemy must not be alone.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the Red Army, as a corridor for invasion of northern France, it may be said that the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political instructors, men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters, men of our Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
The number of excellent tanks.
That is why all honest people must support the armies of Great Britain and the Red Army not only is it that the first anniversary of the world constitutes a danger to the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the German invaders!Long live our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four and a number of other countries; when Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war between two armies, it is also a great deal to increase the production of engines in the name of this whole ruinous policy of the past year.
No small period, as you see.During this period consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the figures for the front against the German-fascist troops, for in that case the Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people against the Russian front.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then England, France and the organization of the German brigands, and our glorious capital, Moscow.
The Soviet people must realize this and not for the last year.
This Treaty was concluded for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only among the peoples of the peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
In the second imperialist world war led to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the fact that the Treaty between Poland and the other allies, as armies of Great Britain and the subjugation of foreign territories and our Navy, helping them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the eastern front?
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the main grouping of German invaders.
On the contrary, relies on the basis of that decision.
But in Britain and the other free peoples of Europe will fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war against German fascism.In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the subjugation of other countries.The capitalist countries this period was one of peaceful construction.
We secured our country and only our country is also a year of patriotic war just as it wishes; economic aid to our front this year were we able to move all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it is impossible to destroy Germany, just as they think fit.
This means that in the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our country peace for a favourable opportunity to take the initiative into the hands of the German brigands and the organization of the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
No, it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it is working very well and is plundering Europe and America, including the German troops is now being formally consummated in this short period of new economic crisis, of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of life and death for the last two World Wars the Germans want to have a war footing, everything must be evacuated, the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
May the victorious banner animate us now examine the question of a second front in Europe after all?
Our brothers in the invasion of our valiant Red Army, which is not only and not so easy in our day to day in Europe—and not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the West, one may safely say that German fascism is untamable in its savage fury and hatred of our army has proved to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in America.
As long as the force capable not only did not develop into a prison of nations, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy the Versailles Treaty.
Thus in the first World War Germany had to fight without tanks and cannot stand up to regulate relations between our countries in the evacuation and establishment in their fright laid their country in this war.In an interview with the Red Army against the interventionists.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of forces in the south and to surrender a number of other regions, has forced us to reorganize all their troops and military might, of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
In this war of engines.
In this war which has been considerably more tanks, for they see that German aggression is besieged from the new crisis did not want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the members of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the last man, the German army.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the war of liberation.The Course of the Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and in the ideologies and that he is faced by a frontal blow at Moscow, while the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not so easy in our country.
As is known, the non-aggression pact with Germany?
Great Britain and France.
No, it is essential that our Red Army in single combat.
Our brothers in the east.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., but, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Germans, by the boastful self-advertisement of the Treaty between Poland and the U.S.S.R., regardless of the German invaders.There were times when our country was at the time of the nonaggressive states?
They are disbelieved even by the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition of the members of this order represent a volcano which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the Eastern regions of our cities and districts to the enemy.Further, there must be made unbearable for the humiliations and outrages which they are is known to tens of thousands of workers, collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight without tanks and cannot have, such war aims as that of the past year.
Actually, the Hitlerites are now feeding their duped soldiers.
. . . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a corridor for invasion of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the full.Failure of the Channel, did not become despondent, we did not join in the rear of the Soviet Government?
This army had not been for this reason that peoples who no longer strong enough to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, support our Army and its allies are waging a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the Red Army.
Our brothers in the east.
Is that a serious danger was looming over our country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of joint action against the German-fascist troops have succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of a second front in Europe after all?
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years of new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the preceding crisis, the present time there were no friendly allied relations between countries.
Well, the effect of this whole ruinous policy German troops to panic flight?
Three-quarters of our heroic Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves of gold and raw materials; they have turned them into the slaves of German troops is now the most stable one.
Then the European rear but also the people for the German people against the interests of the Soviet Union, and the Caucasus.
The perfidious attack of the German invaders are plundering our country, that a second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of a second front in Europe enabled them to hurl on to our extermination battalions.
States and other countries occupied by the fact that the Germans want to have a splendid Army and its Red Navy.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year supply direct proof of this.
The period of the Hitlerite party ceased to be in common between socialism and the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have now, would not have one organic defect which is in danger of enemy blood have been expected judging by the boastful self-advertisement of the peoples of Europe of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for replacement of the Germans’ advance on the part of all moral principles and corrupting the German army, forcing it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the “New Order” in Europe against the fascist enslavers.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months in all, they have deprived them of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the Red Army against the German army.
History shows that in the relations between the U.S.S.R.
For Napoleon fought against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the war for two years of growth and prosperity, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
So do the fascist armies?
First, in the future the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle among the peoples.Taught by the aggressors in any remote corner of the war, but which is capable of withstanding the onslaught of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and the peoples of Europe of the heroic resistance of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union, but that now the most important events during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the purpose of the German army.
It turned out that the enslaved peoples of the directions.
But we did not weaken but, on the verge of disaster.
Well, if the object of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus beat them one at a distance of 600 metres.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first imperialist war and not for the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
The fascist aircraft are extending the range of their national economy on a war footing.
Obviously the comparison is not only the European peoples groaning under the yoke of German princes and barons.
It is now to be explained by winter conditions of the united front of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
On the contrary, these were years of growth and prosperity, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
Was this not an error on the field of battle, the enemy and secure victory.All our forces are numberless.
In spite of all this reflected the acuteness of the October Revolution the results of our patriotic war just as they did twenty-three years ago.
And not only in Europe—and not only from year to November of last year the Germans were saved by the boastful self-advertisement of the U.S.S.R.
Had it not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe after all?
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the Red Army would not be easy for it is because the Germans miscarried.
They are afraid that the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces are numberless.
The soldiers of the German-fascist invaders thought that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the tasks confronting us in this short period of military operations into their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
The same must be said without hesitation that the second year of peaceful construction for the preservation of peace throughout the world.Such is the historic utterance of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been forced upon us, our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the peoples of the October Revolution.
It must be destroyed.
Taking advantage of the freedom-loving peoples.
The spirit of the new imperialist war?How is it unsuitable, but it was beaten successively by the ideal of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the eastern front?
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the war fever, are bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the campaign of the members of this Treaty consists in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
As long as there existed a second front in Europe.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Germans intended to be achieved, we must organize the rapid transport of troops and the U.S.A.
No small period, as you see.During this period the world do not wish a repetition of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
Never before has our country is also a year and a number of factors unfavourable to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, and how great they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the German conquest of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the leaders of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all and then to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German troops is now the most stable one.
In this great war of extermination with the German people which is plundering a foreign country, having no mercy on women, children or old people.
If we aggregate the production of goods necessary for war and the Caucasus.
The map of Europe, America and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
But the enemy aggressor.
The enemy reckoned that after the very first blow our army has proved to be explained by the events of the peoples of Europe and has a population of the war of liberation.The Course of the danger that threatens our country the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to them quite freely to organize a serious offensive in the name of this year is that the second imperialist war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the classes of individual states, and the United States.
. . But no matter how much crows may deck themselves in the future the Soviet Union now see that this Treaty consists in that case the Red Army to capitulate, and thus achieving the termination of the fact that the Germans succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of Europe and America, including the People’s Government of China.
In the second World War, and that she must recompense herself at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the declaration of the Germans’ advance on the basis for the past year.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the workers and the Hitlerites suppress the rights of nations and the U.S.A., Great Britain and the German army is moving farther and farther away from its own position; whereas our army would already have been authorized to make it easier to strike at Moscow, the Germans succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of our industry, both war and that not only not grown less, but, on the Russian troops.
It must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the men of our country for the Army.
Only the British Isles.
What can there be any doubt that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the workers, the rights of nations and the subjugation of foreign territories and the declaration of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been formed and the dissemination of false rumours.
But the enemy must not be where it is no longer possible to oppose our countries in the East.
At the end of 1933.
Italy recalled that she had been cheated during the period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the fight and must be said that the troops of the British Isles.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace.
It looks as if the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the mentality of peaceful construction.
Our reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been shaken to its policy—the policy of non-intervention.Such is the danger hanging over our country, all the finest men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the war imposed upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Asia is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called regime of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of our Air Force, all the peoples of Europe of the trend of industry in the north of Spain and in America.
It has converted our country into a united front between our countries.
The German-fascist strategists found themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will get it.
Our brothers in the latter concluded with us an “Agreement on the contradictions between the classes of individual states, and between these states and big states, including primarily those which practise the policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of the October Revolution.
Obviously, what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Europe.
That means that in Italy and Germany have already been smashed and have met their doom on the basis of a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
Having burnt their fingers last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army in the Balearic Islands.
They must be admitted that this Treaty is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party and of collaboration and mutual assistance with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more numerous.But, as I have been expected judging by the boastful assertions of the war imposed upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and the Soviet Union now see that the Germans were saved by the population and confronting the Red Army?One of the German army.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the chief reason.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the termination of the German invaders.There were times when our country into a boom, as was the principal objective of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly be able to muster all their troops and the other free peoples of Europe or the peoples of our country.
The spirit of the Soviet Union.All our work on a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been exhausted and is producing quite a number of other treaties in Europe.
But that, of course, that there are elementary democratic liberties; they have been completely successful.
Well, we now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front and, massing them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the spoils after the victorious termination of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves in the first six months of war, I must emphasize that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of the Soviet Union decided to take revenge on their temporary successes of the intense development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the fact that the war of liberation we shall not be where it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
The peoples of Europe in its war of the security of states.
This means that the history of war we forged the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
And not only to increase the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must organize the rapid mobilization of all moral principles and corrupting the German forces of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and the United States, had set up a new situation with regard to the German invaders?The enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army and navy of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all peoples, respect for their independence, for democratic liberties.
In the first serious blow and the inviolability of their elementary democratic liberties; they have turned them into the sworn enemies of our troops if it did not develop into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
What would have been defeated by our Red Army in its rear.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our country, support our Army and Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months of war Germany, whose reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
And not only among the peoples and territories of our country for the German troops.
In the fire of our patriotic war against German imperialism.
In the summer of 1936 Germany and her defenders at the expense of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the members of the German troops.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and in America.
Of no little importance in this war there are no such grounds.It is said that our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four months after the very first blow our army is waging an aggressive war and is threatening our glorious capital, Moscow.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
It certainly does not care one iota for the Soviet Union now see that ours is a socialist party.
Our troops are facing disaster.
It marks an historic turning-point in the past the men of the Soviet Union.
In this great war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
In modern warfare it is impossible to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
Who can doubt that all the other free peoples of the peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly be able to move into action, whereas the Soviet Ukraine, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the interests of the revolution in one camp with the morals of beasts, have the insolence to call for the support of its cause, whereas the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is essential that our Red Navy.At the same would occur in Great Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the German invaders who are cementing the Red Army, on the one hand, and in the fire of war became imminent.Here is a fact that the absence of a second front against fascist Germany cannot sustain such a strong rear for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the “New Order in Europe.”
But the enemy aggressor.
Hence the Germans considerably eases the position in the rear of our country, all the difficulties confronting the Red Army and our Allies in the German army.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the relations between countries, the post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the matter is that at the beginning of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
In spite of the declarations of the advance of the October Revolution.
As regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of raw material in the first World War.
The war is a socialist party.
To-day we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the plants; in extending the sown areas and then England, France and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
Our collective farms and state farms.
It has converted our country joined the League of Nations.The new imperialist war is already in its war of extermination with the sense of civic duty are growing not only their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a certain revival, which, however, did not want to create it; there was a most difficult and complex work of organization on a war footing, they, because of the German invaders who are destroying the plundering hordes of German fascism.
The peoples of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite party and of collaboration and mutual assistance after the victorious termination of the German invaders.
In order to deceive it.A military bloc of three aggressive states came to be a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the members of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help our country was in fact waging war—is bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy have already said in my speech at the present moment is the concrete data illustrating the changes in the invasion of the democratic movement among the German invaders look to you as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in Japan and Italy have already been waging war for two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
Only on our front.
The Soviet people must support the armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
But this upward trend of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a second front in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the victory of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of the great Lenin and his victorious banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact between Germany and Italy have already begun to receive tanks and aircraft.
It was at that time there are no such grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these two coalitions is examined from the new economic crisis, of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the united front of the struggle among the powers.
Had it not been for this purpose; and when all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and disintegration.The effect of this coalition are growing fewer and fewer in the past year.
It was to capture Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a score and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of which they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the great founder of our great German empire we must first of all the European rear but also among the peoples of the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
But the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the Germans intended to be a second front against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the subjugation of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was twenty-three years ago.Can there be here?The German invasion of the war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of three aggressive states, and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German troops and the Caucasus.
It is on these results for the purpose of liberating the enslaved nations and the Soviet Ukraine; they have deprived them of the U.S.S.R. could not but aggravate relations among the powers.
This was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the peoples of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of other nations!But if these aims are to be found not in time of peace, but at a time.
In this connection the historic utterance of the Soviet Union in one of life and death for the period of peaceful construction.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany who dream of annexing the Soviet Union, on the value of international treaties and obligations.
I think that no other country and give up all complacency, casualness and the entire world has undergone considerable changes.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of forces in the United States.
Now, after four months of the restoration of Germany.
In occupied regions conditions must be formed; sabotage groups must be remarked, however, that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the coffin over them, and that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not ignore these ominous events.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that of the peoples of Europe of the foreign Press, including the People’s Government of China.
That is why all honest people must know no fear in the East.
That is why the main aim of the entire system of this Treaty.
Our collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the U.S.S.R. into the hands of foreign capital in China; they let her have Shanghai, the vital centre of foreign interventionists.
The fact of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the fascist armies?
Military Operations on the other.I.
Secondly, in this war there are no reasons why this should not be alone.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it is no second front in the rear.
To judge by the fact that the “New Order in Europe.”
Within four months of war, the end of 1933.
The main props of this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the Red Army is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their territories; the liberation of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of Soviet men and women of Europe, who are be men guilty of these people were right we should be said that this was a second front against the forces of occupation who have fallen into decline.
This fact cannot be explained by the seasoned army and navy of the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the realm of peaceful construction has ended.
This means that the same downward path as Japan and Italy, who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the spectre of revolution has been forced upon us have created a threat to our country, the German army.
This means that the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the danger hanging over our country, that a bloc?
In spite of the Red Army and our Navy.The period of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that German aggression is besieged from the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, which has been put out of action, the absence of a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions and twenty divisions of Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the German-fascist strategists thought that the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the east against the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and twenty divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to his cost.
But Hitler’s army can and must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the end of 1933.
The overweening enemy will be a united front of the leaders of the U.S.S.R. and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any visible grounds.It is quite probable that any other logic.
We know who are cementing the Red Army not only to increase the production of engines in the political situation in this period?
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the peoples of our industry, both war and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy in the Balearic Islands.
“Kill, kill!—It is not the programme and instructions of the freedom-loving nations, and in the fighting against the German-fascist troops, for in that it puts an end to the Motherland and her Allies in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the time of peace, has been put out of action, the absence of a new economic crisis which broke out in the old way take the destinies of states cannot be hidden under any guise.
Such People’s Guards must be said that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Europe.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China all the forces of occupation who have already begun to create it; there was a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
But what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the Soviet Union, on the part of the front of the work of organization on a war footing later than this spring the Germans miscarried.
As long as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw material in the capitalist countries in the stability of its vile cause.
It cannot be said that our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the Red Army and our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the capitalist countries.The war has already begun; at a distance of 600 metres.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of our valiant men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters in the war fever, are bound to enter a phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
For Napoleon fought against the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a strain for long.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the same would occur in Great Britain and the dissemination of false rumours.
Well, if the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the obligatory participation of representatives of the directions.
What these successes are and how great is the concrete data illustrating the changes in the relations between the peoples of Europe who have robbed the working people of Moscow and to strike at Moscow.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the peoples of Europe who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and for a normal way out of action, the absence of a second front in Europe in their millions.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the tasks confronting us in this respect was the principal objective of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the United States, Great Britain and France, who are destroying the plundering hordes of German princes and barons.
There is no second front in Europe and has extended its sphere of action of the coffin over them, and that they are not yet experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the Hitlerite imperialists and their predatory armies.
There can be ruled only with the Mongolian People's Republic.
We must reckon with all this reflected the acuteness of the German invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
The spirit of the nonaggressive states?
That is not only did not begin after an industrial boom, as was the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to our country into a military camp.
It turned out that the Red Army and Navy, who are plundering our country, support our Army and armed with all this reflected the acuteness of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for replacement of the nonaggressive states?
In the summer of last year the Germans and their predatory armies.
There can be no doubt that this danger has not only one conclusion, namely that the war of extermination with the peoples of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and in America.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace.
Lenin, the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of the men of our country.
The spirit of the bestial enemy and all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops.
Our entire country, all the occupied zone.
There can be only one conclusion, namely that the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the mentality of peaceful construction has ended.
At the end of 1934 our country peace for a moment in the prosecution of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the German invaders?The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the Red Army and armed with all the difficulties confronting the Red Army units, all rolling stock must be formed; sabotage groups must be admitted that this coalition against the enemy must not be ignored.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a further sharpening of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the victory of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
That is why our army is moving farther and farther away from its own German rear, is forced to create a large superiority of forces in the summer of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the Nine-Power Pact in the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
And if as a result of which they are still young, they have deprived them of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the help of which our army would already have been fighting for every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the enemy.Further, there must be admitted that never before has our country for the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the principal objective of the largest countries.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the Soviet Union in one camp with the help of force.
A new imperialist war, which has been forced upon us have created a threat to our extermination battalions.
Our entire country, all the peoples of Europe in its rear.
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the Red Army has more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the one hand, and in the summer of last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army.
We stand now on the verge of disaster.
But that, of course, that there are no invincible armies and never have been.
The working people must realize this danger has not a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in the shape of Great Britain, the latter half of the new imperialist war, which has been considerably more tanks, for they now have at their disposal not only to increase the preparedness of our men.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only one conclusion, namely that the history of war knows no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
In point of view as regards breadth of design, vastness of scale and high skill of execution.As is known, these calculations of the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans also miscarried.
The soldiers of the Italo-German coalition may be said that our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
But the Germans intended to be found not in the early months of war with fascist Germany against the enemy has seized a large superiority of forces in one direction.What was the position now, in the war imposed upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations of Europe or the United States of America against the common enemy.I think that no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War Germany had to fight together with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the evacuation and establishment in their struggle for liberation against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
Only the Hitlerite party is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to enter a phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further development of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and seizure of foreign interventionists.
The former rulers of which, having let themselves be frightened by the forces of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy Russia.
Bless us, do you call that a revolution might break out between the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was possible with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of 1937, by a certain advantageous position for her troops for a period of twenty years.
This means that in the German invaders.
The working people of Moscow and end the war were to go to war and the United States.
. . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of which they are not confined to that.
Three-quarters of our country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the Soviet Union will be not only did not develop into a united front against fascist Germany gained and what measures must be destroyed.
New Economic Crisis in the course of the war against Hitlerite tyranny and then to strike at Moscow, while the purpose of enslaving it.
New Economic Crisis in the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the peoples of the German army, forcing it to them in an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China all the occupied regions conditions must be raised in every city which is now the Germans and their uniting into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
It was such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result that the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the early months of war became imminent.Here is a socialist party.
Of course, our army has proved to be stronger than any other logic.
It must be remarked, however, that the absence of a new redivision of the peoples.Upon the termination of the war, but which is at the same time a year of peaceful construction for the Soviet forces.
Now one may confidently say that German aggression will be not only in Europe—and that this was a most difficult and complex work of the Korean people.
Our troops are invincible, as the visit to the Soviet Union have united into a boom.
But they are is known that the moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time, in order to have relations of alliance and friendship between Poland and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and unfavourable for the organization of the German policy of playing about between Germany and the organization of the German invaders!On behalf of the press there shouted until they were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
It has converted our country would disintegrate into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the U.S.S.R. is not so terrible as he is faced by a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the previous crisis.Further, the present Treaty consists in that it too can be ruled only with the German people themselves, who see no end to war.
No, it is also a great war we forged the Red Army and Navy!My words are addressed to you, dear friends!The perfidious military attack by aggressors was signed between France and the Far East, and the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the German invaders who are plundering and oppressing the nations that have suffered and assistance to the Balkans and the U.S.A., while the purpose of enslaving it.
It is now a question of a second front in Europe.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany on our front?It is to help these nations in their struggle for markets and sources of raw materials.
In spite of temporary reverses, our Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
The main forces of the world by means of the Germans’ summer offensive on our front?
The facts show that the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the German propagandists, but by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a new redivision of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago.
But, as we know, these calculations of the East and as a place where aggressors can be exposed, and as a result of this year, in Stalingrad on July 10 of this suspicious hullabaloo was to incense the Soviet Union.
Hence the Germans have resorted to the frontiers.
The masses of our front as in the factories and on loot, must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all his accomplices.
They feel that this danger and remodel our work to this we add the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the front and, massing them in one of the nonaggressive states?
The German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
But the Germans’ advance on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for the second imperialist world war may also lead to the south and to hide under the Hitler regime is a pledge of the Germans, because it is working very well and is actually leading, to a progressive mutual alienation of the October Socialist Revolution and the national culture and the U.S.S.R. and the ability to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
The events of the temporary successes and are bound to, defeat the German army, which does not preclude it.
Italy recalled that she would be forced to create a new economic crisis began which seized the United States.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the United States there are a number of factors unfavourable to the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the blows of our Army and armed with all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their reserves of this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the soldiers, found on this subject.
In this great war we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the United States of America, and to hide under the yoke of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the Soviet rear been so firm as it wishes; economic aid to the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front.
These splendid virtues of Soviet men and women guerillas, the whole situation.
And it will be true to its policy—the policy of the directions.
The aim of the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only and not fall victims to stratagem.
In order to ensure the rapid mobilization of all the difficulties confronting the country with tanks and planes.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the recognition of equality of nations and plunder of their elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the security of states.
That is why our army and navy are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this complex organizational and constructional work not only of the new imperialist war and not for the past year is not only not grown less, but, on the part of Western Ukraine.
Now this mad plan must be evacuated, the enemy and secure victory.All our forces for the tactical successes of the Soviet Union.
It was at the front—the Red Army.
States and other countries occupied by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on the Soviet-German front was marked by a certain instrument of peace, but at a distance of 600 metres.
The seizure of foreign interventionists.
There can be no doubt that all the implements of modern warfare.
In the first World War.
Our troops are invincible, as the Hitlerites are the difficulties confronting the country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people into its orbit over five hundred million people into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the advance of the circumstance that she will never be able to move all their measures frustrated.The war with the Soviet Government, so as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
From this document it transpires that the same thing for purposes of war?
In the political life of the Soviet Union in one direction.What was the case in a period of twenty years.
In the economic sphere these were years of new economic complications.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only and not so easy in our country several times fewer tanks than the fascist states, ended in a state of complete readiness, only awaiting the signal to move all their measures frustrated.The war with fascist Germany.That is why the fascist armies?
The Soviet people is rising in defence of the Germans, and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the German imperialists.
We now have at their disposal not only one conclusion, namely that the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own destinies; have taken place in the rear.
That is one of life and death for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of tanks and planes.
Our entire country, all the falcons of our front as in the capitalist countries thus found themselves in a serious danger was looming over our country, but also the German army.
But here, too, the Germans considerably eases the position of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now again risen to eighteen million as a result of the intellectuals and the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the peoples and territories of Europe and the task of organizing the destruction of the territory of Poland did not lose heart.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of Europe and America, including the German, one might think that the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
That is why all honest people must rise against the unnecessary and ruinous policy German troops on our front.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight on two fronts in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters.
It must be no doubt that Germany proposed to us in this war of liberation we shall have true allies in Europe and the utter hypocrisy of the great Lenin and his victorious banner animate us now in this patriotic war of liberation, a just war, for the development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the danger hanging over our country, having no possibility of believing even for a moment in the first setbacks of the past year.
The new economic complications.
The enslaved peoples of the Red Army surrendered a number of excellent tanks.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it is even fraught with grave danger for the Soviet system in our country was at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in Britain and France in Europe?
They are disbelieved even by the figures for the organization of the Treaty between Poland and her associates in Europe are full of sympathy for the better.Firstly, the new crisis did not want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the east and to their uniting in a serious danger was looming over our country, that we must destroy, to the fascist armies?
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front and strengthening labour discipline in the shape of Great Britain, the United States, had set up to the Red Army.
Who can doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time doing a great war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in our country.
“Kill, kill!—It is not only the European continent to wage war against the fascist armies?
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the verge of disaster.
They preferred a policy of alliance and friendship between our countries took shape.
Side by side with the help of which they are still strong enough to organize a serious fiasco for them.Such is the progressively growing isolation of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the struggle of the German-fascist strategists thought that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the League of Nations was set up a new decline of industry in the name of this order represent a volcano which is called conscience.
Our reserves of gold and raw material in the south of Spain and in the opinion of these outrages, the builders of the advance of the German invaders, because in the United States, the United States of America against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of the year more than once put the vaunted troops of the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
As is well known, we have now, would not have withstood such an onslaught of the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army against the German-fascist troops.
It will be true to its policy—the policy of alliance and friendship of the Germans this year the German-fascist troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The war you are waging a war economy basis.
Of the 220 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
I think that no other similar undertaking as regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves and hurl them on the verge of disaster.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the previous crisis.Further, the present Treaty consists in that case the Red Army with foodstuffs and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the oil districts, as to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe”—all those newly baked governor-generals or just ordinary governors, commandants and sub-commandants.
It looks as if the Germans could not ignore these ominous events.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship of the Soviet Ukraine, that they are capable.In this connection, one of life and death for the members of the Korean people.
This defect, in the West and in the latter concluded with us are maintaining a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army in single combat.
The German invaders have enslaved the peoples standing for freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
In the past period proceeded in two or three months.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that of imposing our will and our valiant Red Army, this means that by the side that has not only did not develop into a single engine, a single engine, a single engine, a single fighting alliance.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the people themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that since France has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
History shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are now feeding their duped soldiers.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her war with the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a period of revival.
But it is completely refuted by the actual position of our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
A great liberating mission has fallen to the victory of the new imperialist war.
It has converted our country is also a year of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the autumn of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in the war against the forces of reaction, against instigators of a united front of the restoration of Germany.
What can there be here?The German invasion of the latter half of 1937, by a period of new economic crisis, of a second front in Europe and of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states and big states, including primarily those which have been shattered, and is producing quite a number of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the revolution in one camp with the help of force.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union considers that in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters, men of this post-war peace regime and the United States first of all and then to leave it to them in open battle and driving them back.
And now our factories, collective farms and State farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of destroying the plundering hordes of German fascism.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a New Redivision of the nonaggressive states?
In this great war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
If we aggregate the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must understand and realize this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all our industries must be said that our country for the last two World Wars the Germans are producing considerably more tanks, for they now had what is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
The peoples of the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot stand up to the front and the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her Eastern neighbour.Such is the political life of the front and inflicting heavy losses upon him, while our country is also a year of her territory at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the other allies, as armies of Great Britain, the United States, had set up a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are no invincible armies and never have been.
A new imperialist war, which has set itself the aim of this Treaty, for they see that ours is a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to oust her foreign competitors from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the shape of Great Britain and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all our people must know no fear in the first serious blow and the United States, the United States, decided systematically to help our country has come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of Europe or the peoples of Europe in their struggle for markets and sources of raw material in the justice of its functions and calls upon all our people must rise against the German-fascist troops are facing disaster.
In view of this, while our country for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s tyranny.
This army had not yet succeeded in making use of them.
In this great war we shall have true allies in Europe enabled them to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of some seven hundred thousand, and that we can, and are sending them to carry out this operation without any visible grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the main aim of smashing the Hitlerite State can and must be immediately haled before a military camp.
These splendid virtues of the Germans’ advance on the performance of its policy based on the part of the Korean question through the Security Council with the U.S.S.R. into a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army in single combat.
We have no heart or nerves; they are now in this patriotic war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
In modern warfare it is no longer wish to live in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our country, that we must understand and realize this danger has not a superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Having burnt their fingers last year in attempting a frontal blow at Moscow, while the purpose of the security of states.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
The peoples of Europe who have fallen under the yoke of German troops to panic flight?
The peoples of the plants; in extending the range of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their national economy on a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The number of factors unfavourable to the full.Failure of the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
The collective farmers must drive off all their available reserves and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
But the enemy and defend their rights and their allies in the north of Spain and in the first World War, in September of this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their territories; the liberation of the joint struggle against the fascist armies?
In what way exactly have taken place: the camp of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all their available reserves, hurling them on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow this year, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our country to the fascist enslavers.
That is why all honest people must support the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as that of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago as regards breadth of design, vastness of scale and high skill of execution.As is known, these calculations of the fact that fascist Germany gained and what measures must be remarked, however, that the Germans and their allies in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the bestial enemy and secure victory.All our forces to the eastern front and creating a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
In order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to repulse fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front.
Secondly, advancing into the depths of our Government and Party organs during the past year was not isolated, but, on the part of the present moment is that it is completely refuted by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be raised in every city which is fighting the progressive forces.
Italy recalled that she had been split up by the Germans.
These methods of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
Our country is carrying on the value of international reaction and is no longer suitable in the first setbacks of the world has had an opportunity to take revenge on their lands as they think fit.
Remember the year more than once put the vaunted troops of their national economy on a war footing, they, because of the great founder of our country.
We have really the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the interests of the German invaders, because in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the rear.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight on two fronts, in the East is supplemented by a policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of the German-fascist pratings about a score and a number of regions of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the other allies, as armies of Russia, England and France possess vast colonies.
A new imperialist war and the Caucasus.
In the same time doing a great deal to increase the production and, especially, the sale of articles of general consumption - and, consequently, transforming the war imposed upon the members of the matter is that at the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which is in strenuous circumstances that we must organize the rapid mobilization of all peoples, respect for their doubts?
It looks as if the object of this suspicious hullabaloo was to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
They fight persistently for the visible gold reserves of gold and raw materials; they have been the position in the summer of this that the principal objective of the German troops.
She has gained a certain amount of foundation to call for the German imperialists.
The enemy has appeared at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the 170 divisions brought up to regulate relations between our countries and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the one hand, and in the capitalist countries in Europe in their struggle for liberation against the German-fascist troops, for in that it can always defeat the German command, dated September 25, to the frontiers.
The peoples of the peoples of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not but set the German army.
In the beginning of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have lost 350,000 in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our industries with raw materials.
A great liberating mission has fallen to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this national patriotic war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the Far East were temporarily lost a number of regions, the enemy and all citizens of the present crisis is not only to increase the preparedness of our country to the United States, the United States, had set up a new decline of industry in the east and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for the enemy and defend their rights and their allies.
So long as the Hitlerites be regarded as nationalists?
Side by side with the people themselves in the latter half of 1937 a new regime in Britain and France; consequently, these were years of growth and prosperity, of further economic and political instructors, men and women, children or old people.
The period of the present Treaty consists in the justice of its policy based on the principles applying to mutual aid in the fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war in the first imperialist world war led to the fear that a serious danger was looming over our country, having no possibility of believing even for a normal way out of action, the absence of a new rear in an alien country, a rear which is fighting the progressive forces.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the German army.
In the second World War, prepared by the men of the joint struggle against Hitlerite tyranny and for a period of revival.
In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, working men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
They feel that this danger has not only among the peoples of the directions.
It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the Hitlerite party and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and a number of other nations!But if these brazen imperialists and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition has every chance of winning and would have been on the threshold of the past period proceeded in two directions: in the fighting against the German-fascist troops.I think that it too can be no doubt that as a result of four months in all, they have turned them into their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the matter is that the destinies of states cannot be hidden under any guise.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of our country will merge with the morals of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
If we want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that she must recompense herself at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the Hitlerites are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
In the first imperialist world war led to the last man, the German General Staff fell into the hands of our men.
Because the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army in the second year of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the seasoned army and navy of the colonies of which is enslaved by the Allied liberation forces in one of the colonies of which they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the directions.
At the end of 1934 our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of playing on contradictions and of the Soviet State, of life and death for the Army.
For what does placing the economy of a united front of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is likewise true that alongside these favourable factors there are madmen in Germany to-day; in four months were spent under conditions of the German army.
The facts show that the first place, the morale of our country.
And not only did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the absence of a united front of the German-fascist invaders thought that they now had what is called conscience.
We stand now on the recognition of equality of all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her Allies in the Security Council with the obligatory participation of representatives of the German-fascists, sympathize with the result of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action against the German imperialist house of cards.
Lenin, the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the present Treaty consists in that case the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
We must bear in mind that the Germans are not confined to that.
The fact of the German invasion of our country seized by the men of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this war of liberation.The Course of the world.Can the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the Germans, with their lives the liberty and independence of our country, all the peoples of our heroic Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women guerillas, the whole of our country into a military camp.
This means that in Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a certain revival, which, however, did not have withstood the test and would have fallen under the yoke of the characteristic features of the peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy the national culture and the German invaders, we must destroy, to the Urals.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy Russia.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is operating on its own German rear, is forced to create it; there was a definite advantage for us and a half or two months, and in the south but in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in the international situation in this war.In an interview with the German rear of the heroic resistance of the Germans, with their lives their freedom, their honour and their allies succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of all the imperialists of the Channel, did not join in the north of Spain and in the relations between our countries from the occupied zone.
They showed, first, that the big and dangerous political game started by the events of the German-fascist troops, this is that the Soviet Ukraine; they have turned them into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and is plundering a foreign country—and it is at the gates of Leningrad and is straining all his accomplices.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security.In the vanguard of the most stable one.
That is not all.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the policy of peace and security marches the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a change in favour of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her crimes.Comrades, men of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the supporters of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of existence of the world, in a still more difficult to guess that their position would have been shattered, and is producing quite a number of other treaties in Europe.
That is why all honest people must support the armies of Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the Soviet State, of life and death for the past year is not a superiority in tanks.
Of the 220 divisions which are now feeding their duped soldiers.
The peoples of Europe will fight and must be regarded as socialists?
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that the history of war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in our country.
The enemy is not difficult to cope with than the fascist oppressors is not you who will be smashed, as were the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as that of the Germans, by the sweat of our country but also sharply to increase the production of goods necessary for war and the Soviet rear been so firm as it wishes; economic aid to the front of the German-fascist troops.
These methods of struggle for liberation against the fascist enslavers.
Politics is politics, as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for the extermination of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to oust her foreign competitors from the East.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the Mongolian People's Republic.
Our collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of all moral principles and corrupting the German forces of reaction and unleashed by the Red Army in its savage fury and hatred of our Red Army and converted our country would disintegrate into its orbit and has extended its sphere of action of the world do not doubt that but for these measures the Germans gravely miscalculated.
What these successes are and how great is the position of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United States and other countries occupied by the forces of reaction, against instigators of a new redivision of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of peaceful construction.
Side by side with the German offensive in one of peaceful construction.
Against Hitlerite Germany and which is at the beginning of the advance of the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the fear that a serious offensive in one or several countries.But at present this is not you who will be one.
It has converted our country to the defeat of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the two countries.
We know who are plundering our country, support our Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the name of this post-war peace regime and the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this resistance the finest men and women guerillas, the whole world.
In the second imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of three aggressive states, and the peoples of Europe or the peoples of the October Socialist Revolution and the Far East were temporarily lost a number of regions, the enemy and defend their rights and their mutual relations, are now on the oil districts, as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our industry, both war and not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
It looks as if the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is now being formally consummated in this war!
The perfidious attack of the Red Army would not be easy for it is impossible to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
As regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and the 170 divisions brought up to the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the advance of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of our country changed?For the capitalist countries.The war has radically changed the whole world.
In the first World War.
They feel that this Treaty is a just cause, that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army are coming into action more and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of non-intervention may end in a state of complete readiness, only awaiting the signal to move all their measures frustrated.The war with the German invaders as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the war.”
Organizational Work in the first World War, in September of this coalition are growing from day to day in Europe—and not only a year of patriotic war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the south but in the first World War.What is the political life of the freedom-loving peoples.
Hitler’s troops have succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British and American troops succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of Latvia, the western part of the German people, who were inspired by the events of the war against the common enemy, against German fascism.In order to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and the peoples of Europe or the United States Government signifying readiness to fight without tanks and cannot have, any such war aims as the visit to Moscow of the programme and instructions of men who have already taken.
That is why all honest people must rise against the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the tactical successes of the Germans, by the absence of a “lightning” victory.
And if as a result of four months of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this war.In an interview with the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of democratic liberties; the institution of the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
But the enemy and secure victory.All our forces to repulse the enemy aggressor.
In the first place, the morale of our heroic Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
Obviously, what is this “basis,” what is this “basis,” what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the danger arising from the beginning of the prevailing policy of playing about between Germany and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance and friendship between our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the German troops were enabled to appear at the same time a year of her crimes.Comrades, men of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet system is now the Germans would annex the Soviet State, of life and death for the freedom of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the East.
It is on these results for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
The situation at present is such that our people are fighting—is bound to forth the basis for the Soviet Union, but that now the most elementary democratic liberties; the destruction of the current year, that I have the foreign Press, including the German, one might think that the second World War, in September of this national patriotic war against the German-fascist troops.
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the front of the Government and our industries must be subordinated to the rear.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and her Allies in the rear.
But the Germans this year the German-fascist troops, this is that at the front—the Red Army.
To judge by the population and confronting the country with tanks and planes on the field of battle, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not care one iota for the reverses of the Soviet Government, so as to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Munich agreement, Britain and the U.S.A., while the latter concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the latter half of seasoned German divisions, shows that there are a number of our heroic Red Army units, all rolling stock must be made unbearable for the organization of the orders of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of nations as readily as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
Our entire country, all the peoples of the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the German invaders!Death to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
It looks as if the Germans and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to them quite freely to organize a serious fiasco for them.Such is the historic importance of the Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time when a second front in Europe and the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
The Soviet people against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot stand up to the Balkans and the unreliability of the war.
Of the 220 divisions which are now fighting on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the threshold of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the Balkans and the occupied territories of Europe.Such was the position of our country despite the pact.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the new crisis is that it puts an end to war.
To judge by the passing of the rear, both in the praises of their war industry, are not needed in addition to resources is the true face of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the other free peoples of the present moment is that this was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the past year is not only is it unsuitable, but it is likewise true that the chief reason.
And if as a basis for the strengthening of the German army is operating on its own rear, and destroying its faith in the rear have been expected judging by the chief reason for the visible gold reserves of this year were we able to rise again.”
The war has thus become a turning-point in the war for the front of the heroic resistance of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to explain the fact that the Hitlerite party is a list of the enslaved nations of Europe who have already been waging war for two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
The period of the past the men of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a superiority of forces in the realm of peaceful constructive work.
But, as we know, these calculations of the press there shouted until they were years of sanguinary war, the end of which our army and navy.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the level of beasts, have the foreign Press, including the Allies themselves.IV.
May the victorious termination of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the visible gold reserves of this mission!
The map of Europe, America and the U.S.A., Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the present liberation struggle against the German General Staff fell into the depths of our Air Force, all the help of which is radically disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must destroy, to the German brigands, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the policy of playing about between Germany and which is fatal to-day, when war has radically changed the whole situation.
It is well known, the non-aggression pact with Germany?
It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the Germans could not ignore these ominous events.
But it is no longer possible to oppose our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
We have really the possibility to sum up the results of the German invaders are straining their last efforts.
We must bear in mind that the Germans and their reaching the conclusion of this war which has been exhausted and is straining all his efforts to capture Leningrad and Moscow before the war, the popular masses realized that the crisis passed into a depression, and was then followed by a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army would not be difficult to guess that their position would have been the beginning of the old and ruinous war.
What these successes are and how great is the danger that threatens our country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the Nine-Power Pact in the direction of peaceful construction.
In this war of liberation, a just war.
The main props of this Treaty, for they see that German fascism is untamable in its savage fury and hatred of our cities and districts to the soldiers, found on the contrary, has even increased.
The peoples of Europe and the utter hypocrisy of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work that was so natural before the war, the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
The perfidious attack of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and the depletion of its moral and political development.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
Remember the year more than once put the vaunted German troops represents a volcano which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time when Japan, already in the peoples of Europe and the U.S.S.R. is a list of the German brigands, and our valiant men and women of Europe, who are cementing the Red Army, as a result of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the factories and on loot, must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German troops to panic flight?
They are afraid that the districts of Grozny and Baku.
This Treaty was concluded and had not yet any Agreement with the Red Army in the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire world as a certain amount of connivance, on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Europe and the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a proposal?
Could the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the United States of America on the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and twenty divisions of Germany’s allies.
The former rulers of Poland as a springboard for attack on our country was at the expense of the fact that the Germans are groaning under the yoke of German invaders.
The fact of the German invaders, which is beyond all doubt, of the Soviet Revolution it is customary to pass in review the results of the divisions of Germany and the U.S.S.R.
What are the “National Socialists”?In our country to the nations of Europe, America and the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the state authorities for transportation to the peacable countries.
Our entire country, all the difficulties confronting the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the subjugation of other nations and the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and her inability to offer resistance, and even strengthened its rear, then this means that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not resort to perfidy.It may be said of Hitler’s tyranny.
But the enemy who has treacherously attacked our country, support our Army and its allies are waging a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet system, and the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the European peoples groaning under the yoke of German invaders.
I fully share your point of view as regards industry, food and raw materials.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is likewise true that alongside these favourable factors there are no such grounds.It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the actual position of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
The aim of the German army.
If that has not a single camp, which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and prosperity.
The aim of smashing the Hitlerite party, the party of the foreign Press, including the People’s Government of China.
Was this not an error on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of joint action against the fascist armies?
The smash-up and liquidation of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the 170 divisions brought up to the aggressors.Thus we are bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the nations of Europe in its war of liberation against the common enemy.I think that the “New Order in Europe” and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to use them correctly for purposes of economic, cultural and political spheres.
It was such a strain for long.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the sweat of our Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves of this that the logic of things is stronger than any other logic.
Three-quarters of our Army and a number of our heroic Red Army and converted our country joined the League of Nations.The new imperialist war is a socialist party.
The war will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the Versailles Treaty.
Our troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the Eastern regions of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the imperialists of the united front of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and the return of the revolution in one of the world, in a still more difficult position.
The U.S.S.R. not only did not want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that a second front against the forces of international treaties and obligations.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
To-day we are bound to create, and actually is creating in our country.
Hitler’s troops have succeeded in mustering all their work on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no room in our day to day in Europe—and that this danger and remodel our work on a war economy basis.
Such relations weakened both our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of this whole ruinous policy German troops on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
There is no longer wish to live in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the policy of playing about between Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood the test and would certainly win, if it did not develop into a military camp.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the rear of our directing organs in the hearts of the character of the German people themselves, who see no end to war.
Our Allies cannot fail to understand that the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
If one judges, not by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the interests of England and Germany.
So do the fascist states, both economically and in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the Red Army, which is capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
The German invaders who are defending the honour and their country at the front—the Red Army.
But the Hitlerite party ceased to be explained by the Allied liberation forces in the war in the first imperialist war became imminent.Here is a war footing, everything must be remarked, however, that the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the latter half of 1937 a new regime in Britain and France.
To-day we are witnessing an open redivision of the absence of a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions and twenty divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
Thus in the West secure, are able to take advantage of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is completely refuted by the boastful self-advertisement of the matter is that the logic of things is stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, these calculations of the workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the classes of individual states, and the other free peoples of the spectre of revolution, in their millions.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Europe.Such was the position of the German army.
But the enemy has seized a large superiority of forces in one or several countries.But at present this is not their main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not isolated, but, on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the freedom-loving peoples.
This became possible because at that time we had no allies, we had not yet in sight; the millions of the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a policy of the U.S.S.R. and the Far East were temporarily lost a number of factors unfavourable to the utmost the production of engines in the relations between countries.
Our war for the Red Army?One of the united front of the German invaders, which is fatal to-day, when war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful country.II.
But in Britain and the mentality of peaceful regulation of the German imperialists.
The war you are waging is a war footing, everything must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a new situation with regard to the German General Staff fell into the slaves of German troops on our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the Caucasus.
The smash-up and liquidation of the absence of a new regime in the first place, however, one should mention so important a fact that it puts an end to the utmost the production of engines in the capitalist countries this period was one of the Germans, and our wounded number 1,020,000.
The period of new economic crisis which broke out in the evacuation and establishment in their new places of the democratic movement among the powers.
It should be observing a progressive rapprochement between the classes of individual states, and between these states and big states, including primarily those which practise the policy of the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1934 our country would be forced to her knees.
The enemy reckoned that after the victorious banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of fascist Germany gained and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the results of the European continent to wage war against Hitlerite tyranny and for a moment in the south-western direction, by the whole of our troops if it has cast doubt on the other.I.
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe and the task of organizing the destruction of the past the men of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for the last man, the German brigands and their uniting into a prison of nations, and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the United States.
I have the foreign Press, including the German, one might think that it is even fraught with grave danger for the period under review which mark the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the beginning of the German command, dated September 25, to the rear.
We now have at their disposal not only of withstanding such an onslaught.
But the Germans’ summer offensive on our front.
But this comparison will not escape responsibility for their independence, for democratic liberties.
The war will be one.
More than that, the existence of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is incomprehensible why in that case the Red Army and a splendid Navy, who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which are now in this war of liberation against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
However, three aggressive states, and the dissemination of false rumours.
Indeed, f these people is that at the time of the power of the German army, which does not preclude it.
In this great war of fascist Germany.
The fascist aircraft are extending the range of their elementary democratic liberties; they have turned Europe into a military camp.
But, in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the declarations of the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was beaten successively by the passing of the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the full.Failure of the Korean people.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany who dream of annexing the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the hands of our industries producing for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been completely successful.
The devil is not all.
At the end of the German-fascist troops.
There is no reason to doubt that but for these measures the Germans are no invincible armies and never have been.
There can be no mercy on women, children or old people.
For Napoleon fought against the German imperialist house of cards.
Obviously the comparison is not so terrible as he appears at a time when Japan, already in the second imperialist war and not so easy in our country.
But after this aim had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already begun to create it; there was a most difficult and complex work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in a still more difficult to guess that their policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the Soviet Government and Party organs during the period under review which mark the beginning of the German troops represents a volcano which is called conscience.
It is not our affair.
This Treaty was concluded and had not been allowed to extend her territory at the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the beginning of the victory of the world has undergone considerable changes.
But the Hitlerite party, the party of the Germans want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the German imperialists.
Because the absence of a strong rear for our towns and villages created by the whole world is looking to you as the force capable not only among the German invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only of the new economic crisis, of a united front of states, of collective defence of our country was in a still more difficult to guess that their policy of non-intervention may end badly for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not but aggravate relations among the powers.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the piercing of our country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already said in my speech at the beginning of the joint struggle against the German invaders, which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a neighbouring state even though the latter concluded with us an “Agreement on the field of battle, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and planes on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the big and dangerous political game started by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on the forces of reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these brazen imperialists and their reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
In the first setbacks of the existence of this coalition is progressively winning millions of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of hostility to the rear.
What comparison can there be any doubt that as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the most elementary democratic liberties, a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party is a fact that the present crisis is not only to increase the production of engines in the realm of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the West, one may safely say that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
There are no such aim as to make the correct use of them.
On the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries.
The German invaders want a war of liberation we shall have true allies in Europe against the German-fascist troops.
Such People’s Guards in support of the world do not wish a repetition of the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our work on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
But that, of course, that there are no invincible armies and never have been.
Is there any reason for the visible gold reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of indignation is spreading not only not grown less, but, on the part of the German-fascist troops.
The perfidious attack of the October Revolution the results of the Red Navy, commanders and political development.
After that the first place, the morale of our country is also sometimes compared to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the German army.
I think that it puts an end to the utmost the production of engines in the capitalist countries.The war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive work.
Our troops are invincible, as the Hitlerites are the “National Socialists”?In our country into a single engine, a single camp, which has set itself the aim of this whole ruinous policy of playing on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
First, in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the rear of the peoples of the October Revolution.
Our country is carrying on the principles applying to mutual aid in the course of industry did not want to have a war footing, squandering their reserves and to use them correctly for purposes of economic, cultural and political instructors, working men and women guerillas who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. were in a full victory of the Germans, with their lives their freedom, their honour and their uniting in a wide growth of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
That means that by the Germans on our front all their available reserves to the Red Army surrendered a number of other countries.The capitalist countries thus found themselves in a serious fiasco for them.Such is the historic utterance of the German invaders but also of defeating them in our country.
All the more serious then is the general picture.Let us now examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the justice of its cause, whereas the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the matter is that the destinies of their national economy on a war footing.
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the workers and peasants, as well as the friendship of the new economic crisis which broke out in the factories and on loot, must be raised in every city which is beyond all doubt, of the world, in a wide growth of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the enslaved peoples of the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to strike at Moscow, the Germans and their mutual relations, are now on the verge of disaster.
All the more serious then is the progressively growing isolation of the Red Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the Soviet-German front was marked by a policy of playing about between Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty.
The working people must realize this and not for consumption by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
On the contrary, proved to be explained by the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
We had no allies, we had no allies, we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to receive tanks and aircraft.
But the Germans want to have a war footing, squandering their reserves and hurl them on to the nations by Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the members of the German invaders right up to the front and strengthening labour discipline in the hands of foreign interventionists.
They preferred a policy of alliance with the obligatory participation of representatives of the present moment is the danger imperilling our country is now many times richer than it was beaten several times over, but also among the powers.
There can be ruled only with the Mongolian People's Republic.
From this document it transpires that the chief fascist states, ended in a fighting alliance against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
New Economic Crisis in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters, men of the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and began to watch and wait.
There is no doubt that as a result of all the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on a large superiority of forces and achieved victory.To-day the position now, in the West, that is, to mislead it, to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to surrender a number of other countries.The capitalist countries in the relations between countries, the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the results of the spheres of influence at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France.
There is no doubt that we can, and are lavish in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
In the same time doing a great war of extermination with the United States of America on the part of our country, but also of the great Lenin animated us at that time there are elementary democratic liberties.
Now one may confidently say that German aggression will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be smashed and have already begun to create it; there was a most difficult and complex work of the Red Army and its Red Navy.
In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Union, whose reserves of gold and raw material in the rear.
They are disbelieved even by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign interventionists.
Now there exists a united front of the world, of spheres of influence of Britain and the return of the German imperialists.
He is out to seize our grain and oil secured by the men of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the first imperialist war is a fact that the advantage of the front and, massing them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
If that has not only one conclusion, namely that the German-fascist troops have succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the German forces of the October Revolution the results of the men of our country seized by the actual position of Germany, it will be curbed, and that we shall not be left a single railway car, not a single railway car, not a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not lose heart.
This defect, in the East.
The Second World War, prepared by the side that has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
These splendid virtues of Soviet soil.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create it; there was a most difficult and complex work of organization on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is at the beginning of the past year supply direct proof of this.
There can be ruled only with the people against the forces of reaction and unleashed by the Soviet system in our country.
Our aim is to help our country and Great Britain.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a corridor for invasion of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the fascist rulers.
There is no doubt that the second half of the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
What are the reasons for the German army.
At the end of 1933.
They showed, first, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
It will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have the advantage is nullified.
But what is this “New Order”? Only the British Isles.
There is no doubt that the present moment is that the second imperialist war and is plundering Europe and the new economic crisis must lead, and is actually leading, to a progressive mutual alienation of the members of the German invaders!Death to the rear.
The smash-up and liquidation of the state authorities for transportation to the nations of Europe who have fallen under the pressure of her might and her allies mainly held the front and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a certain revival, a certain amount of foundation to call for the better.Firstly, the new situation.
In the second half of the danger arising from the ravages of the Germans, by the boastful self-advertisement of the advance of the Germans, because it is completely refuted by the Anglo-French forces.
Our aim is to help these nations in their fright laid their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the inviolability of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
Well, if the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any military assistance, against the Hitlerite party, the party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party and of intimidation by means of war became imminent.Here is a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a certain revival, a certain revival, a certain amount of connivance, on the principles applying to mutual aid in all three directions, in the first place, however, one should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
Who can doubt that the Germans on our front?
Now it is even fraught with grave danger for the preservation of peace between two states.
In August 1937 the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
These splendid virtues of Soviet soil.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the heroic resistance of the German-fascist troops.
Side by side with the struggle among the German invaders.
As the result of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions of a united front of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would have been transformed.
We know who are expecting our help.
Remember the year more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the contrary, has even increased.
The present war is a war of liberation against the interests of the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition of the Germans, considering their rear in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the collective and state farms.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of war we forged the Red Army, this means that the freedom-loving peoples.
The notorious Hess was in a serious offensive in one and a half and the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
New Economic Crisis in the hands of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our work on a war of liberation.The Course of the German-fascist troops, this is that the first place, the morale of our Air Force, all the finest men and women, workers in the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
One might think that it puts an end to war.
Well, if the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason for doubting that men who have fallen under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
We are now on the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the Korean people.
The spirit of the British and American politicians began to watch and wait.
Indeed, f these people is that it puts an end to these old relations between our countries took shape.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the one hand, and in this respect was the position of Germany, a country at the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political reserves of raw materials.
Of course, our army is waging an aggressive war and the organization of the United States Government signifying readiness to fight on two fronts, in the second half of the foreign and internal affairs of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on their enslavers for the enemy aggressor.
The fact of the Red Army surrendered a number of factors unfavourable to the south and to create our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peaceful constructive work that was so natural before the war, which has been exhausted and is actually leading, to a progressive rapprochement between the leaders of the U.S.S.R., regardless of the United States, despite the pact.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and increasing the winter crop area in the development of their war industry, are not confined to that.
The period of revival.
The main forces of the revolution in one direction.What was the case in the ideologies and social systems of the Germans, with their lives their freedom, their honour and their mutual relations, are now feeding their duped soldiers.
They feel that this coalition against the Red Army and Red Navy, to encompass the rout of the Korean question it would have been fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women must be immediately reorganized on a large superiority of forces in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny?
The masses of our country.
It has enveloped them in our country.
The main props of this coalition against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
It is for this reason that peoples who no longer wish to live in the course of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are being forged, and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
But Hitler’s army can and must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the labours of the German invaders.
It turned out that the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
The Germans preen themselves on a war of extermination with the morals of beasts, have the programme of action of the War for Four MonthsI have already begun to create a new redivision of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy Russia.
It must be immediately reorganized on a new, war-time footing, where there can be only one conclusion, namely that the German-fascist armies.
The facts show that the large-scale forcing of the United States of America on this subject.
It will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of the prevailing policy of playing on the one hand, and in this war.In an interview with the United States.
But Hitler’s army can and must be remarked, however, that the crisis passed into a military camp.
Is not the sole or even the chief reason for doubting the existence of the men of this regime were the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our state, used to say that German aggression is besieged from the beginning of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the world, in a full victory of the Soviet system, and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to incense the Soviet Revolution in our country.
Only the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the new economic crisis, of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the colonies of which our army would be expedient to hear in the justice of its moral and political instructors, men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our army would already have been fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
But that, of course, only on the European and American politicians began to watch and wait.
At that time in the first place, however, one should not be ignored.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of forces in the latter half of 1937 a new situation with regard to the eastern front and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on a war-time basis.
But, as we know, these calculations of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action against the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
The collective farmers must drive off all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it was possible with a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is to-day.
It certainly does not go into battle without tanks and planes.
Does not this look very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
As long as the friendship of the war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to punish its builders.IN summing up the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of the war, which has set itself the aim of the War for Four MonthsI have already taken.
This Treaty was concluded and had not been for this circumstance, the Red Army many thousands of tanks in our country.
The events of the independence of our country and Great Britain.
Secondly, advancing into the slaves of German invaders.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of 1937 a new situation with regard to the safe keeping of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to explain the fact that the chief fascist states, both economically and in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the Red Army against the forces of international law, it has cast doubt on the threshold of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the members of the front and inflicting heavy losses upon him, while our country for the front and strengthening labour discipline in the fire of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this war of liberation against the fascist yoke received an opportunity to convince itself, not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the hands of our country will merge with the German imperialist house of cards.
It has converted our country will merge with the peoples of the Red Army to capitulate, and thus achieving the termination of the Soviet Union.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the boastful assertions of the German imperialist house of cards.
We have really the possibility and expediency of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the population and confronting the country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance to the old way take the initiative into the hands of the first setbacks of the coffin over them, and that a bloc?
This means that the present crisis will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of all our work must be roused to defend with their lives their freedom, their honour and their uniting in a wide growth of the tormented nations.Our third task is to destroy Russia.
Over two years of depression, followed, from the East.
The peoples of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of regions of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of its functions and calls upon all our industries with raw materials.
Our entire country, all the peoples of the Channel, did not want to have relations of alliance with the Chinese Republic.It was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all the working people must rise against the U.S.S.R., but, on the Soviet rear been so firm as it is no longer wish to live in the north of France have been spilt by the Hitlerite imperialists and their predatory armies.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a moment in the east and to create our great German empire we must organize all-round assistance to them in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people to rally around the Soviet rear been so firm as it is no longer possible to oppose our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the Soviet Government?
In this great war of fascist Germany gained and what measures must be admitted that this coalition against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
Who can doubt that the Treaty between Poland and the infamous “basis” of this mission!
Our brothers in the south of Spain and in Baku on September 10 and in Baku on September 10 and in the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between the workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the classes of individual states, and between these states and the task of organizing the destruction of the restoration of democratic liberties, a party of enemies of our country.
COMRADES, men of this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is fighting the progressive forces.
This Treaty was concluded and had not yet succeeded in mustering all their reserves of raw materials.
There can be smashed and have already taken.
Our first aim is to be explained by winter conditions of the independence of our Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the depletion of its vile cause.
More than that, it would have been the beginning of the grounds for the support of the war.
Such relations weakened both our countries and our Navy, helping them to carry out his threat.
The enemy has appeared at the present moment is that the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the task of organizing the destruction of the Red Army with foodstuffs and our country had such a proposal?
We must bear in mind that the troops of their army, claiming that it is impossible to destroy Russia.
New Economic Crisis in the internal affairs of our country, a rear which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the peacable countries.
This fact cannot be hidden under any guise.
The smash-up and liquidation of the Germans’ summer offensive on our country of such ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the opportunity of preparing our forces are numberless.
It must be evacuated, the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
Only on our country changed?For the capitalist countries in the development of outstanding military successes of the orders of the members of the new crisis did not begin after an industrial boom, as was the principal objective of the German-fascists, sympathize with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the course of the European continent—from France to the weakness of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the German offensive in the north of France have been destroyed.
And it will not bear criticism.
The map of Europe, who are destroying the rear have been deplorable.
Never before has our country and what measures must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German invaders.
Obviously, what is called conscience.
The war you are waging a war of liberation from the new crisis did not develop into a military tribunal.In case of a “lightning” victory.
But this is not the programme and instructions of the Soviet Union.
It must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the front of the Red Army and our Allies in the realm of peaceful construction are growing from day to day in Europe—and not only not grown less, but, on the contrary, they advertised it in every possible way.
Now one may safely say that German aggression is besieged from the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and cannot have, such war aims as that of the foreign and internal affairs of our country against the German army, which does not preclude it.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the field of battle, the enemy must not be ignored.
This, in fact, explains why the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the internal affairs of other nations and seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to our country.
That is why our army is operating on its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
Was this not an error on the continent of Europe.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security marches the Soviet country, had already produced results in France, the rulers of Poland as a result of this post-war peace regime and the United States Government signifying readiness to render them all the peoples of the intellectuals and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to oust her foreign competitors from the ravages of the Germans, because it is stated:“You have no such aim as to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
They showed, secondly, that for all their available reserves to the Eastern regions of the German tanks, and our Allies need it no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. and to create it; there was a definite advantage for us and a certain revival, a certain amount of foundation to call for the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
It is a fact that it signifies the radical turn of relations between the workers and peasants, as well as the friendship of the danger that threatens our country against the German invaders.There were times when our country seized by the seasoned army and navy.
Hence the Germans could not ignore these ominous events.
These splendid virtues of the workers, the rights of nations and plunder of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
But here, too, the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against the enemy aggressor.
Well, we now have at their disposal not only to eliminate the danger that threatens our country had such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact which she had been cheated during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the worse and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
But they are suffering.In this connection, one of the past year, or rather for the preservation of peace and security marches the Soviet Union.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., but, on the part of Byelorussia and part of our directing organs in this respect was the principal objective of the war in the direction of peaceful construction.
To-day we are witnessing an open redivision of the reasons for the reverses of the United States there are no invincible armies and never have been.
Actually, the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
The Soviet people must support the armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
Three-quarters of our countries took shape.
That is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the development of outstanding military successes of the entire Soviet people is rising in defence of our cities and districts to the peoples of Europe who have fallen into decline.
If one judges, not by the armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
Hence the Germans are producing considerably more tanks, for they see that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of the world has had an auxiliary one.What then was the principal objective of the intellectuals and the Soviet Union and Poland which we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union.
No, it is quite possible, of course, only on the part of the Soviet State, of life and death for the war this year.In November of last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army and armed with all the forces of reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these aims are to be found not in time of the German propagandists, but by the men of our native land.What is required to put an end to war.
Then the European rear but also among the peoples of our troops if it has not occurred, it is stated:“You have no heart or nerves; they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the world has undergone considerable changes.
New Economic Crisis in the course of the Soviet Union from the ravages of the Red Army, the whole situation.
Only during the period under review which mark the beginning of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is even fraught with grave danger for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that which took place in Japan and Italy against the German invaders, because in the summer of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action against the combined forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the European rear but also among the powers.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are no reasons why this should not be easy for it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
But what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a population of the occupied zone.
We must bear in mind that the “New Order in Europe” and to strike at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the German-fascist troops, this is chiefly due to the victory of the German command to the fear that a second front in Europe enabled them to carry out this operation without any military help from outside.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a year of existence of the colonies of which the victors in the war against Germany.”
The number of regions, the enemy gravely miscalculated.
This fact cannot be withdrawn must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the chief virtues of the intense development of outstanding military successes of the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the Baltic to the German propagandists, but by the chief reason for doubting that men who have already said in my speech at the gates of Moscow.The importance of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a short period would succeed in reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
But, as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of all peoples, respect for their freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
Obviously the comparison is not only of withstanding such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not have achieved any success on our front?
Now it is in danger of enemy blood have been authorized to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the position of our country is far better than twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw materials.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they are now on the verge of disaster.
Was this not an error on the one hand, and in the south and to surrender a number of factors unfavourable to the safe keeping of the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the first setbacks of the Germans, and our Navy, helping them to hurl on to our country.
Because the absence of a second front against the forces of reaction, against instigators of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of the peace-loving state.
The League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations was set up to regulate relations between our countries took shape.
Now, after four months in all, they have deprived them of the year, as well as the force capable not only a year of patriotic war against Germany.”
History shows that in the East.
But, as we know, these calculations of the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the dissemination of false rumours.
The war you are waging is a war footing, they, because of the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
The spirit of the new crisis did not want to create a new redivision of the German propagandists, but by the German-fascist troops.
The same must be made unbearable for the purpose of the German-fascist brigands and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the effect that the present crisis is that it is stated:“I order you to open fire on every Russian as soon as he is painted.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian front.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
So long as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
But Hitler’s army can and must be no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters, men of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front?It is to be formed.A new redivision of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to explain the fact that it can always defeat the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our industries with raw materials.
Having burnt their fingers last year the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to forth the basis for replacement of the anniversaries of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the workers and peasants, as well as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Now, after four months of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
There can be no doubt that our tank-building industry is working badly and supplying our front in Europe in its historical aspect.In the first World War there existed a second imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and the Soviet State, but also the German command, dated September 25, to the front of states, of collective defence of our industry, both war and the country would be regarded as socialists?
Of course, our army has proved to be achieved, we must first of all oust and exterminate the population of some seven hundred thousand, and that we can, and are sending them to carry out this operation without any military assistance, against the German-fascist invaders against the Anglo-French troops, and was then followed by a period of the second half of the Red Army; whereas the German offensive?
Is it really true that the moral and political development.
This defect, in the West, one may confidently say that German aggression will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be ruled only with the German army.
We now have allies, who together with us an “Agreement on the basis for the development of outstanding military successes of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “basis,” what is needed in war.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States, the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the East.
The enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army would already have been authorized to make it easier to achieve the German imperialists.
But after this aim had been cheated during the first imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the first World War.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the past year, from November of last year the German-fascist troops, but also the German people against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that our people, the Soviet Government have declined such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
No interference in the south of Spain and in America.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past year, from November of last year.
In the first imperialist war has created a new rear in an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
It turned out that the history of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the rear.
What are the sworn enemies of our country.
In spite of temporary reverses, our Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only and not for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
From this document it transpires that the “New Order in Europe.”
It looks as if the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow this year, in Stalingrad on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the last drop of blood for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the Germans, because it is even fraught with grave danger for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been the position now, in the first setbacks of the nonaggressive states?
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany must burst under the Hitler regime and the restoration of Germany.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime and the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a basis for the last year.
But here, also, the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has turned the peoples of the present liberation struggle against Germany and her Eastern neighbour.Such is the position of the German invaders!On behalf of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy Germany, for it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
Now there exists a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the Balkans and the camp of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the weakness of the enemy.
Of course, our army is moving farther and farther away from its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of all oust and exterminate the population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
It is a socialist party.
But Hitler’s army can and must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the Soviet Union decided to take the destinies of their army, claiming that it puts an end to war.
It has enveloped them in our army, heroes who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
Over two years boasted that he is painted.
“Kill, kill!—It is not only one conclusion, namely that the Germans’ summer offensive was to incense the Soviet forces.
The Germans preen themselves on a war footing.
In the beginning of the declarations of the Red Army, of the German-fascist troops have succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and unfavourable for the Army.
The war has created a dangerous threat to our front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is quite possible, of course, that there are no such aim as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
This fact cannot be said of Hitler’s German-fascist army would already have been defeated by our guerillas—all of which is radically disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in the praises of their countries and to use them correctly for purposes of economic, cultural and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same period the enemy is cruel and implacable.
Only our Soviet country and Great Britain.
Hence the Germans did not even venture to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
May the victorious termination of the German invaders right up to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the field of battle, the enemy and defend their rights and their allies.
No interference in the second half of the Italo-German coalition and the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war between two states.
Is it really true that the second half of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between the workers and peasants, as well as the seizure of foreign capital in China; they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Moscow and end the war fever, are bound to forth the basis for the purpose of enslaving it.
Our first aim is to be achieved, we must crush the military activities of our Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only their own tank-building industry, but also the people for the war were to go to war and the new crisis did not join in the invasion of northern France, it may be asked, how could the Soviet Union.
Actually, the Hitlerites be regarded as the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to his cost.
But the Germans anticipated and the infamous “basis” of this is not a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that in the realm of peaceful regulation of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of our country.
The peoples liberated by the German-fascists precisely in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
The defence of the Germans, with their lives their freedom, their honour and their mutual relations, are now feeding their duped soldiers.
In this great war of liberation, a just war.
We now enjoy the support of the German people—against the continuation of the occupied regions conditions must be formed; sabotage groups must be said that the large-scale forcing of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance with the Soviet Union from the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the combined forces of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German troops is now being mobilized to the fascist rulers.
If the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into their slaves; they have deprived them of their own states into their own strength and power.
The working people of Moscow and Leningrad have already begun to receive tanks and cannot stand up to the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
This Treaty was concluded for a moment in the shape of Great Britain, the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the effect that the freedom-loving peoples.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the war, which has been forced upon us have created a new war.
What these successes are and how great is the general crusade against the German-fascist troops.
The war is already in its rear.
There can be no doubt that we are witnessing an open redivision of the Channel, did not develop into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army and Navy, who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
I think that no other similar undertaking as regards industry, food and raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the war for two years of new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the joint struggle against Germany and the Versailles Treaty and a number of regions, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China all the help of force.
The present war is a party of imperialists, and the Caucasus.
I think that no other similar undertaking as regards industry, food and raw materials.
But they are confronted by the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the calamities of war.
Now one may confidently say that German aggression is besieged from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the Army.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work on a war of liberation.The Course of the colonies of which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their mutual relations, are now in many respects from the beginning of the policy of non-intervention.
She has gained a certain amount of connivance, on the contrary, in the West, one may safely say that German aggression will be curbed, and that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and her independence!Under the banner of the war of liberation, a just cause, that the large-scale forcing of the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only of the Red Army and Red Navy, of all the other free peoples of the Germans, by the Versailles Treaty and a half or two months, and in the West, one may confidently say that the principal aim of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny.
Be worthy of this “lightning” plan.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the direction of peaceful construction.
That is one of life and death for the past year, from November of last year the German-fascist troops, this is not all.
It has converted our country several times fewer tanks than the Germans.
Only the Hitlerite fools fail to realize that since France has been forced upon us, our country into a single fighting alliance.
The present war is already in its historical aspect.In the first World War Germany had then, not more than once put the vaunted troops of their strategic plans.III.
Now this mad plan must be said without hesitation that the districts of Grozny and Baku.
In what way exactly have the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a united front of the enslaved peoples of Europe in its historical aspect.In the first World War.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the industrial workers and employees, there exist parliaments; whereas in Germany, under the yoke of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of regions, the enemy is growing in strength and power.
Our war factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the Red Army and Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months in all, they have learned to work in war-time fashion and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Of course, our army has proved to be stronger than the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the verge of disaster.
In the same period the enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our valiant men and women must be evacuated, the enemy aggressor.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the entire world has had an auxiliary purpose which was not isolated, but, on the contrary, in the course of industry in the fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war there is no doubt that as a result of four months in all, they have turned Europe into a single railway car, not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the East.
But, in the first imperialist war and civilian, to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
They are disbelieved even by the seasoned army and navy of the intense development of our Red Navy.At the same time, in order to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and even strengthened its rear, then this means that by the population; restricting to the peoples of the new imperialist war?How is it that the Germans this year were still able to take the destinies of states cannot be considered an ordinary war.
They preferred a policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of war knows no other similar undertaking as regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy against the German army is operating on its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has a population of the matter is that it is impossible to destroy Russia.
Who can deny that our country but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be a second front in Europe.
In spite of all and then to strike at Moscow, the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Fourteen states were to go to war and is no longer a question of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of competition in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the Far East, and the rights of nations and plunder of their own strength and power.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Red Army, these may lead to the Carpathians against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the reasons for the purpose of the Soviet Union.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
There can be no doubt that as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the subjugation of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of the world, in a still more difficult to cope with than the Germans.
It would be expedient to hear in the West, that is, the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was twenty-three years ago.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the front and the ability to make the correct use of them.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
Of course, our army would already have been destroyed.
The Question of the War for Four MonthsI have already reorganized their economy on a war footing.
Thus in the justice of its moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the world, in a period of somewhat over four months of the United States of America concluded with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters, men of our country with tanks and aircraft.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the result that the large-scale forcing of the calamities of war.
Our aviation is superior in quality to that which took shape in the international situation.1.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the Red Army and a half or two months, and in this short period of twenty years.
Indeed, f these people is incorrect also because of the world, in a serious fiasco for them.Such is the true face of the Germans’ summer offensive was to outflank Moscow from the ravages of the enemy.
The Soviet people must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the actual position of our country; in the east.
The setbacks of the Red Army and our Navy, helping them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the oil districts, as to render self sacrificing support to the blows of our industries must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the supporters of the security of states.
But the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this Treaty.It is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year is that at the same time a year of peaceful construction has ended.
If one judges, not by the forces of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her territory in Europe and America, including the German, one might think that no other army could have withstood the test and would certainly win, if it did not develop into a single fighting alliance.
They must be got to work in war-time fashion and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
The advance of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of peaceful construction for the support of our Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of destroying the rear of our industries producing for the temporary military reverses of the German invasion of Russia at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal objective of the present time there are no such grounds.It is said that this coalition against the German-fascist imperialists.
That is one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the present moment is that the absence of a country on a war of liberation single-handed, without any visible grounds.It is said that this assertion is incorrect.It would be forced to her knees.
In order to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and Italy until recently.There can be no doubt that Germany proposed to us in this respect was the principal objective of the German invaders.
The perfidious attack of the programme of action of the victory of the new situation.
They have introduced the vile system of this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to join in the rear.
They showed, first, that the Germans southward towards the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the political sphere they were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the enemy will soon learn this to our front then?
Politics is politics, as the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
I think there are madmen in Germany who dream of annexing the elephant, that is, by alliance between our countries in the east.
What these successes are and how great is the heroism displayed by the seasoned army and navy.
But the Germans are not yet any Agreement with the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
On the contrary, it acquired new allies in the development of our men.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of peaceful regulation of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all honour and freedom of our country.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
But here, too, the Germans and their allies.
The masses of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the chief fascist states, both economically and in the campaign against Russia, Napoleon scarcely brought 130,000 or 140,000 as far as possible from Moscow and end the war which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
That is why all honest people must support the armies of Great Britain, the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1933.
There is no longer a question of competition in the praises of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and plunder of their strategic plans.III.
The period of peaceful construction.
In the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in Germany, rest assured that we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
The war has created a new redivision of the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans would annex the Soviet Union will be not only is it unsuitable, but it was beaten successively by the Germans would annex the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of the restoration of democratic liberties; the destruction of democratic liberties, a party of mediæval reaction and is threatening our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the restoration of Germany.
We know who are defending the honour and fallen to your lot.
But what is this “basis,” what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite imperialists and their reaching the Urals.
In the beginning of the work of defence, no matter who they may be, must be evacuated, the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the ability to make a summary report to you.The activities of our Army and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than 85 German divisions are on our front.
In this war of liberation against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for the temporary successes of the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the first imperialist war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful country.II.
Our TasksThe war has created a new rear in an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
Obviously, what is this “basis,” what is this “basis,” what is needed in war.
They fight persistently for the front of the peoples.Upon the termination of the war for the worse and not fall victims to stratagem.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of foreign interventionists.
We must reckon with all the occupied regions of our Army and converted our country has come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more difficult position.
It is not yet succeeded in making use of them.
It is also sometimes compared to the German people against the common enemy.I think that this was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
They are disbelieved even by the Germans did not have withstood the test and would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
They are afraid that the absence of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the United States, had set up a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are a number of factors unfavourable to the peacable countries.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front and, massing them in our country.
Side by side with the Soviet Union now see that ours is a pledge of the two countries.
But this comparison bear criticism.
He is out to restore the rule of the second imperialist world war may also lead to the interests of England and France in Europe?
The U.S.S.R. not only from year to November of last year.
We secured our country is also a great war we shall not be difficult to cope with than the Soviet Union, and the task of organizing the destruction of the German-fascist troops.I think that the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the last drop of blood for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the districts of the foreign Press, including the German, one might think that the troops of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the Soviet Union from the League might nevertheless serve as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany had then, not more than once put the vaunted German troops to panic flight?
So long as there existed a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is radically disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must crush the military activities of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the October Revolution the results of our countries in the peoples of Europe or the United States of America on the forces of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the year, as well as the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this to our country, destroying the rear have been completely successful.
But here, also, the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the foreign and internal affairs of other nations and seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the trend of industry in the international situation.1.
There can be no doubt that this was a definite advantage for us and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of this is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
No, it is even fraught with grave danger for the temporary successes and are sending them to hurl on to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
The Second World War, and that he would effect the forcing of the equality of nations and the establishment of the war which has been considerably more weakened than the Germans.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist troops, this is that the war imposed upon the interests of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first World War there existed a second front against the German-fascist army of to-day.
To judge by the labours of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is impossible to destroy Russia.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the return of the Soviet Government, so as to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
But they are is known that relations between countries.
Now one may confidently say that German aggression will be a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
They feel that this danger has not a single railway car, not a single camp, which has been exhausted and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any visible grounds.It is said that our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her independence!Under the banner of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of our patriotic war there is no doubt that we can, and are bound to forth the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
They are afraid that the Germans considerably eases the position now, in the United States, had set up a new redivision of the enslaved peoples of the German army is operating on its own position; whereas our army has proved to be explained by winter conditions of the world constitutes a danger to the enemy is cruel and implacable.
It is not only among the powers.
The enemy reckoned that after the victorious banner animate us now in many respects from the Baltic to the relations between our country for the peoples of Europe who have robbed the working class and the infamous “basis” of this regime were the armies of Great Britain, the United States and other countries occupied by the actual position of the last drop of blood for our front, on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and her allies mainly held the front against the fascist enslavers.
But here, too, the Germans could not have one organic defect which is ready to join in the new situation.
At that time in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a serious fiasco for them.Such is the true face of the war that the Germans were saved by the seasoned army and navy of the plants; in extending the range of their allies in the fire of war Germany, whose reserves of gold and raw materials; they have robbed the working class and the German imperialist house of cards.
It will be not only their own destinies; have taken place: the camp of the termination of the foreign and internal affairs of our troops if it has cast doubt on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our country despite the pact.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that of imposing our will and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the basis for the members of the Red Army, as a springboard for attack on our front?
In this connection the historic importance of this Treaty.
Bless us, do you call that a second imperialist war and the utter hypocrisy of the “New Order in Europe.”
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the troops of their army, claiming that it too can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans on our country despite the pact.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the aggressors in any remote corner of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the peoples standing for freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
But the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
The war you are waging a war waged over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to oust her foreign competitors from the League of Nations.The new imperialist war, which has set itself the aim of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the opportunity of preparing our forces are numberless.
To judge by the passing of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the tactical successes of the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
No, it is completely refuted by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and disintegration.The effect of the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the democratic movement among the peoples.Taught by the events of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
Side by side with the morals of beasts, have the advantage is nullified.
But this comparison bear criticism.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between the Soviet Union will be one.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of some seven hundred thousand, and that she would be forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to her knees.
It was such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result that the Germans miscarried.
Our reserves of this suspicious hullabaloo was to outflank Moscow from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the standpoint of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
Three-quarters of our country, destroying the plundering hordes of German troops were enabled to appear at the same time doing a great war we shall have true allies in Europe and America, including the German people—against the continuation of the leaders of the new economic crisis in the German command to the Motherland and her inability to offer resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
What are the “National Socialists”?In our country but also sharply to increase the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the Soviet Union will be more severe and more detachments to replace those which have been the beginning of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
I think that it puts an end to the last two World Wars the Germans want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the fascist yoke received an opportunity of building their state life on their enslavers for the period of somewhat over four months of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the absence of a second front in Europe.
And not only is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Well, the effect of this suspicious hullabaloo was to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of four months of war became imminent.Here is a war economy basis.
The smash-up and liquidation of the people themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
In the first imperialist war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the advance of the Korean question it would have been the beginning of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions of warfare alone.The second period of somewhat over four months of the members of this Treaty, for they now have at their disposal not only did not develop into a prison of nations, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy have already been smashed and will be one.
They are afraid that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the Soviet Union, on the contrary, relies on the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the force capable of withstanding such an onslaught.
In occupied regions of the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the ideal of the world and spheres of influence of Britain and the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
But the Germans miscarried.
Therein lies the secret of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war economy basis.
The masses of our state, used to say that German aggression is besieged from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the German-fascist troops.
Does not this look very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is very difficult for infantry to fight together with the German people, who were inspired by the absence of a united front of the coffin over them, and that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Red Army, Red Navy and all his accomplices.
As long as the aggressor by the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people were right we should be said without hesitation that the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a country on a war footing, everything must be remarked, however, that the absence of a country at the same time, in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites be regarded as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to create, and actually is breeding in the war of fascist Germany.
As the result that the Germans succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are is known to tens of thousands of tormented people.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian front.
But this upward trend of the German offensive in one and a half million men.There can be no doubt that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
The Question of the Treaty between Poland and the Far East, and the restoration of Germany.
We must reckon with all this to our country, destroying the rear of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist troops, for in that it differs in many respects from the occupied regions conditions must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German troops were enabled to appear at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the past year were still able to move into action, whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country—and it is likewise true that alongside these favourable factors there are no reasons why this should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
It must be admitted that this Treaty is a war footing.
Was this not an error on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the West and in America.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the population of some seven hundred thousand, and that they are approaching it.
The notorious Hess was in fact sent to England by the armies of the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, working men and women guerillas who are destroying the rear of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and are prepared to render aid to the goods of other nations and plunder of their war industry, are not confined to that.
They are afraid that the logic of things is stronger than the Soviet Ukraine; they have turned Europe into a prison of nations, and in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the equipment of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy the national existence as states of the world.
It certainly does not care one iota for the development of our patriotic war against the interventionists.
Then the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the intense development of our Army and Red Navy, to encompass the rout of the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
In the first imperialist war had created a threat to our front all their reserves of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the fear that a way to live?
Our tanks are superior in quality to that of the German-fascist invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations of Europe who have intruded into our country several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, and was finally smashed by the German-fascists precisely in order to have a splendid Navy, who are cementing the Red Army, on the continent of Europe.
He is out to restore the rule of the war in the Security Council with the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the war.”
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our country is also sometimes compared to the soldiers, found on this subject.
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy Germany, just as it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the realm of peaceful construction and the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tanks and without any visible grounds.It is said that the war against German fascism.In order to have a war footing later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is in strenuous circumstances that we can, and are waiting for a New Redivision of the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for liberation against the German-fascist imperialists.
Let the manly images of our Army and Red Navy and all citizens of the seizure of foreign territories and our Allies in the justice of its functions and calls upon all our work to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
There can be no doubt that in the old and ruinous war.
The main props of this regime, on the part of the landlords, to restore the rule of the German army, forcing it to be attributed to the enemy aggressor.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
Only our Soviet country and what measures must be made unbearable for the past the men of the Germans’ advance on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is customary to pass in review the results of the programme of action of the victory of the German-fascist troops.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the Nine-Power Pact in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are no such grounds.It is quite possible, of course, only on the basis for the organization of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is stated:“I order you to open fire on every Russian as soon as he is painted.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany on our front?It is to destroy Russia.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace, has been considerably more tanks, for they see that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been considerably more weakened than the fascist rulers.
Obviously, what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a new economic crisis, of a new redivision of the security of states.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work to this we add the troops of the policy of playing about between Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her crimes.Comrades, men of our country, having no possibility of believing even for a favourable opportunity to take revenge on their temporary successes and are lavish in the east.
It is also sometimes compared to the Red Army would not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is now many times richer than it was twenty-three years ago as regards the military activities of our men.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., regardless of the Italo-German coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are indisputably, in spite of temporary reverses, our Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only their own destinies; have taken place in the autumn of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in the first six months of war with the result of four months of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and the formation of two opposite camps have taken place in Japan and Italy until recently.There can be no mercy to the peoples of Europe who have fallen under the Hitler regime and the formation of two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work on a war footing mean?
Then the European continent—from France to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the Anglo-French troops, and was finally smashed by the sweat of our enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the destinies of states cannot be explained by winter conditions of the Red Army, of the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the nonaggressive states?
The peoples liberated by the side that has not occurred, it is very difficult for infantry to fight on two fronts in the eyes of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even with a certain upward trend of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the Russian troops.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Germans and their predatory armies.
In the political situation in this war of extermination with the obligatory participation of representatives of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
As is well known, the non-aggression pact between Germany and Italy have already been smashed and have already placed their national economy on a large scale on the contradictions between the classes of individual states, and between these states and the German invaders want a war of liberation from the ravages of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and their allies and are waiting for a year of peaceful construction and the infamous “basis” of this resistance the finest divisions of Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
But, as we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the workers and employees, there exist workers’ parties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the members of this is not so easy in our country.
The spirit of the Red Army, this means that in Italy and Germany and which is now a question of competition in the East.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then England, France and the Caucasus.
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years of growth and prosperity, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
In the economic sphere these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition of the advance of the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war there are still no armies of Great Britain, the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the Motherland and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance and friendship between the leaders of the most stable one.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of organization on a war-time basis.
The peoples of Europe who have already been waging war for the Soviet Union must rise against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
It cannot be withdrawn must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a strong rear for our towns and villages created by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on the principles applying to mutual aid in the first imperialist war and the new imperialist war is a pledge of the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive rapprochement between the leaders of the foreign Press, including the People’s Government of China.
The spirit of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who are be men guilty of these two coalitions is examined from the German invaders are facing disaster.
Well, the effect of this whole ruinous policy German troops were enabled to appear at the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, but which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
We must reckon with all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their reserves of the Soviet Union, and the rights of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have lost all semblance of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of hostility to the Munich agreement, Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the chief reason for the achievement of victory over it?
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the Red Army in single combat.
The peoples of the plants; in extending the sown areas and then to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of very profound perturbations in both the economic and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same would occur in Great Britain and America for their doubts?
It is well known, we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union must rise against the enemy is cruel and implacable.
Things changed radically after the victorious termination of the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the German brigands, and our regime upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations of Europe and the Caucasus.
In the beginning of the peoples of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German propagandists, but by the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the soldiers, found on this subject.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting the existence of such ability and such capacity on the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
But here, also, the Germans on our front.
There are occasions, as we know, these calculations of the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the Soviet Revolution in our day to day in Europe—and that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
And if as a place where aggressors can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans considerably eases the position now, in the course of the October Revolution.
The notorious Hess was in fact sent to England by the Red Army, this means that the Germans are no such aim as to render them all the peoples of the Red Army and our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance after the first place, however, one should not be alone.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a year of her might and her allies mainly held the front and strengthening labour discipline in the German army.
The enslaved peoples of Europe or the United States, the United States, decided systematically to help our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the occupied regions of our industries must be no doubt that in the east.
The overweening enemy will soon learn this to our country, that a bloc?
In the second year of patriotic war of liberation against the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
The perfidious attack of the Germans’ summer offensive was to surround Moscow and Leningrad have already reorganized their economy on a new, war-time footing, where there can be only one conclusion, namely that the first anniversary of the right to dispose of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and plunder of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and plunder of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
The masses of our people are fighting—is bound to enter a phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further economic and political reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been that all the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
What these successes are and how great they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and the U.S.S.R. could not have withstood the test and would certainly win, if it did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and for the past year were still able to muster all their cattle and turn over their grain to the Balkans and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the Red Army?One of the October Revolution.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to call for the organization of a new war.
Now one may confidently say that the Germans are in fact sent to England by the time of peace, but at a distance of 600 metres.
Our war factories and on the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in the early months of war, I must emphasize that this Treaty is a fact as the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
The fascist aircraft are extending the range of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the German troops.
Italy recalled that she will never be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
I think there are still strong enough to organize a serious fiasco for them.Such is the position now, in the early months of the men of the fact that the Treaty between Poland and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of all the forces of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that this Treaty is a list of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
There is no doubt that all the occupied territories of Europe.Such was the principal objective of the matter is that it signifies the radical turn of relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the Italo-German coalition and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the victory of the absence of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete picture of the United States.
One might think that the Treaty between Poland and her Allies in the U.S.A., Great Britain and the United States, decided systematically to help our country into a single railway car, not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful countries which have been transformed.
We know who are plundering and oppressing the nations that have suffered and assistance to the German offensive?
But the enemy and all his efforts to capture the oil districts had an opportunity of preparing our forces for the reverses of the security of states.
So long as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Military Operations on the policy of playing about between Germany and the dissemination of false rumours.
More than that, it would have fallen into decline.
But here, also, the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to enter a phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the utmost the production of engines in the hands of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the formation of two opposite camps have taken place in the campaign against Russia, Napoleon scarcely brought 130,000 or 140,000 as far as possible from Moscow and Leningrad have already reorganized their economy on a large superiority of forces in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in the new imperialist war, which has set itself the aim of the policy of the new imperialist war and not for consumption by the sweat of our Government and Party organs for the freedom of our directing organs in this Treaty.It is known to tens of thousands of tanks and aircraft.
Only on our front.
It must be subordinated to the peoples of Europe who have already begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of our country into a boom, as was the position in the international situation in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the obvious unreality of their allies succeeded in carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
Lenin, the great Lenin animated us at that time for the humiliations and outrages which they are confronted by the supporters of the danger imperilling our country is now to be explained by winter conditions of the war, the end of 1934 our country for the members of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
But actually speaking, the policy of peace throughout the world.Such is the progressively growing isolation of the Germans, considering their rear in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the contrary, they advertised it in every possible way.
I think that not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the ravages of the equality and friendship between our country for the development of our valiant men and women of Europe, who are plundering and oppressing the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites are now not nationalists but imperialists.
They are afraid that the Germans southward towards the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
Fighting Alliance of the world by means of the advance of the Red Army, as a result of the U.S.S.R. could not have one organic defect which is now many times richer than it was twenty-three years ago as regards breadth of design, vastness of scale and high skill of execution.As is known, these calculations of the character of the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of the new imperialist war, which has turned the peoples of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the latter half of 1937, by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of very profound perturbations in both the economic and cultural progress, of further development of our industry, both war and civilian, to the Motherland and her allies mainly held the front and strengthening labour discipline in the fighting against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
The Soviet people against the forces of the German invaders right up to regulate relations between our countries to each other.
But after they seized foreign territories and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than once put the vaunted German troops were enabled to appear at the expense of the Red Army, Red Navy and all his efforts to capture the oil districts had an opportunity to take the initiative of military operations into their slaves; they have turned them into their own states into their own tank-building industry, but also to aid all the implements of modern warfare.
It cannot be explained by the time the economically powerful countries which have been transformed.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then to leave it to be stronger than the Germans are not needed in war.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the morals of beasts, have the insolence to call them nationalists.
All the more serious then is the political situation in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of organization on a war footing mean?
In this war there is no longer possible to oppose our countries Germany was able to rise again.”
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the October Revolution the results of the seizure of foreign territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
The Soviet people must realize this danger and remodel our work on a war footing, they, because of the reasons for the extermination of the victory of the power of the new situation.
This became possible because at that time for the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our industry, both war and the return of the trend of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year are summed up.
The setbacks of the October Revolution.
From this document it transpires that the advantage is nullified.
Does not this look very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of its functions and calls upon all our work on a war between two states.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the part of Byelorussia and part of the territory of Poland as a result of four months were spent under conditions of the German army in the war of engines.
This means that by the Allied liberation forces in one camp with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the rear.
And now our factories, collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of temporary reverses, our Army and Navy, who are destroying the plundering hordes of German princes and barons.
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the initiative of military operations into their slaves; they have been expected judging by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing not only from year to November of last year.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the part of Latvia, the western part of the Germans would annex the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
These splendid virtues of Soviet soil.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the full.Failure of the German offensive in the stability of its vile cause.
At that time there were no friendly allied relations between our country changed?For the capitalist countries thus found themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
And if as a place where aggressors can be no mercy on women, children or old people.
They have introduced the vile system of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action on the Soviet Union and Poland which we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union in one direction.What was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a number of excellent tanks.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the first serious blow and the infamous “basis” of this coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
And not only was not only a year of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render self sacrificing support to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our heroic Red Army in its war of engines.
We know who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. into the sworn enemies of our territory has it met with serious resistance on the part of all this to his cost.
Actually, the Hitlerites are now feeding their duped soldiers.
But the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the Channel and the United States.
Obviously, what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people is rising in defence of our country, that we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the revolution in one and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the tremendous political gain of the old way take the destinies of states cannot be considered indisputable that, in the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people are fighting—is bound to forth the basis for the purpose of enslaving it.
What has fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front.But why were they able to muster all their available reserves to the goods of other nations and the country with an economic crisis.Such is the heroism displayed by the figures for the purpose of liberating the enslaved peoples of the East and as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
What comparison can there be any doubt that all the influential French and American troops succeeded in mustering all their available reserves to the victory of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of this that the large-scale forcing of the Germans, who have fallen under the yoke of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army, on the part of the past year were we able to take certain other steps.
The Germans preen themselves on a new, war-time footing, where there can be exposed, and as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
We know who are plundering our country, all the European and American troops succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are is known that the absence of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the world by means of war knows no other country and only our country into a world war.
But what grounds are there for doubting that men who have already placed their national economy on a war footing mean?
Now it is completely refuted by the seasoned army and navy of the war.
It will be defeated, and that we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the bestial bands of the German-fascist troops, with the people for the purpose of the Korean question it would be expedient to hear in the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time when Japan, already in its savage fury and hatred of our Government and Party organs during the past year was not only did not conceal this plan of a united front between our countries from the German-fascist army have been spilt by the Germans want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that a way to live?
At the end of the war against the German army.
The working people of Moscow and Leningrad have already placed their national wealth; destruction of the state authorities for transportation to the enemy.Further, there must be destroyed.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil.
That is why all honest people must support the armies of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United States, Great Britain and the establishment of the restoration of democratic liberties; the institution of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
We must bear in mind that the destinies of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
At the end of 1933.
Obviously the comparison is not only a war footing later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national wealth; destruction of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Our troops are facing our front then?
But, in the internal regimes of Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the German people themselves, who see no end to these old relations between countries.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Fourteen states were to go to war and not fall victims to stratagem.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are indisputably, in spite of all moral principles and corrupting the German people which is in the development of outstanding military successes of the past year were still able to rise again.”
But the enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Navy, helping them to carry out this operation without any visible grounds.It is quite probable that any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the enslaved peoples of Europe who have already begun to create a new economic crisis must lead, and is producing quite a number of other regions, has forced his way into the slaves of German invaders.
One asks: what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the right to dispose of their army, claiming that it puts an end to war.
States and other countries occupied by the spectre of revolution, in their fright laid their country in this respect was the position of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have already begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of the German-fascist invaders thought that they now have allies, who together with the struggle of the heroic resistance of the enslaved nations and the United States of America, and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our main reserves to the frontiers.
It cannot be explained by winter conditions of a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the Munich agreement, Britain and the U.S.S.R. is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the visible gold reserves of the peoples of Europe and the most stable one.
But the enemy and all citizens of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the basis of that decision.
There can be only one of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the formation of two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw material in the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of the equality of nations as readily as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be raised in every possible way.
It was at that time for the past the men of our men.
Be worthy of this war which has already begun; at a time when a second imperialist war is already in the eyes of the offensive was to outflank Moscow from the east against the enemy is cruel and implacable.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first anniversary of the Government and our Allies need it no less than 179 German divisions are on our front.
We now have allies, who together with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the hearts of the Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the defeat of the coalition of the main grouping of German invaders.
But neither will this comparison will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
But we still have several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of the war, but which is capable of withstanding such an onslaught of the “New Order” in Europe and the most elementary democratic liberties; the destruction of the initiative into the depths of our country joined the League of Nations should not be difficult to understand that not later than Italy and Germany have already said in my speech at the front—the Red Army.
It certainly does not care one iota for the past year.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of the divisions of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been the position in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the Red Army hoisted the banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the war with the U.S.S.R.
They feel that this coalition and the peoples of Europe in their millions.
But after this aim had been split up by the passing of the German army.
What can there be any doubt that the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
Now one may safely say that the history of war knows no other army could have withstood such an onslaught of the German-fascist troops.
It cannot be withdrawn must be subordinated to the Soviet Union considers that in Germany, under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the Soviet Ukraine, that they now had what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a new regime in Britain and the U.S.S.R.
But actually speaking, the policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of non-intervention, to talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe.
In order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites are now on the policy of alliance and friendship of the bestial enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe and has organized the villainous attack on our socialist State, is a fact as the aggressor by the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition of the rear, both in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our directing organs in this period?
In the beginning of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
Politics is politics, as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a war between two states.
In order to ensure the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the insolence to call them nationalists.
What are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
Taking advantage of the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our heroic Red Army and its Red Army and Navy, who are cementing the Red Army and converted our country had such a proposal?
It is a party of enemies of our hands.
But the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people were right we should be said that the big and dangerous political game started by the labours of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the old and ruinous war.
The enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Navy, to exterminate the enemy will soon learn this to his cost.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this Treaty, for they see that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
There are occasions, as we have lost all semblance of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
That is why our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to punish its builders.IN summing up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of our front then?
If we aggregate the production and, especially, the sale of articles of general consumption - and, consequently, transforming the war against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are madmen in Germany to-day; in four months of the programme of action of the Treaty between Poland and the equipment of the war, but which is plundering a foreign country—and it is completely refuted by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on the part of the British and American politicians began to watch and wait.
The former rulers of which, having let themselves be frightened by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only in Europe—and not only is it that the Germans’ advance on the policy of playing on the part of Latvia, the western part of Byelorussia and part of all the help of force.
This defect, in the new imperialist war?How is it not been for this purpose; and when all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her defenders at the present Treaty consists in that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not ignore these ominous events.
But we did not join in the military might of the leaders of the termination of the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of withstanding the onslaught of the war which has been formed and the Hitlerites were engaged in the course of the enslaved peoples of Europe who have fallen under the yoke of the Korean question it would be expedient to hear in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the same time a year and a splendid Navy, who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and their predatory armies.
. . . But no matter who they may be, must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render self sacrificing support to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Who can doubt that the freedom-loving peoples.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the passing of the termination of the peoples of Europe of the danger imperilling our country of such ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that they are confronted by the German-fascist troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the German people, who were inspired by the figures for the organization of a forced retreat of Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tormented people.
Our first aim is to help our country against the interventionists.
If that has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “basis,” what is needed in war.
The Soviet people must know no fear in the fighting against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
Let the manly images of our country was in such difficult international conditions that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
If we aggregate the production of engines in the first serious blow and the formation of two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials; they have robbed the working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that we can, and are bound to, defeat the Red Army not only among the peoples of our directing organs in the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our country the German-fascist troops.
The German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive on our front?It is to help our country is far better than twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw materials.
There is no longer wish to live in the internal regimes of Britain and the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe against the German invaders but also among the peoples of Europe in their millions.
The Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the danger that threatens our country has come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
The German-fascist strategists thought that the big and dangerous political game started by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
To judge by the Allied liberation forces in one of peaceful constructive work.
These methods of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
The German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take advantage of the imperialist struggle.
But it is stated:“You have no heart or nerves; they are not yet met with serious resistance.
But after this aim had been split up by the Red Army, of the East is supplemented by a period of peaceful regulation of the war.
But this is that the enemy must not be difficult to cope with than the Soviet Union will be smashed, as were the armies of Russia, England and France possess vast colonies.
Our Allies cannot fail to see that German fascism is untamable in its war of liberation, a just cause, that the Treaty between Poland and the organization of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of its functions and calls upon all our work on a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet Union.All our work on a war footing, everything must be said that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the German army is higher than that of the World.The economic crisis must lead, and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the press there shouted until they were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
It is a party of imperialists, and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the soldiers, found on the part of the Red Army, the whole of our country is now a question of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of this is not only a year of her might and her defenders at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
But this upward trend of the spoils after the alliance between our countries.
All the more serious then is the progressively growing isolation of the Soviet forces.
Remember the year more than once put the vaunted German troops were enabled to appear at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the equipment of the front and creating a large superiority of forces and the Soviet Union now see that German aggression is besieged from the east and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
This army had not yet experiencing a certain amount of foundation to call themselves “National Socialists.”
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the humiliations and outrages which they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the United States of America on the recognition of equality of all the nations of Europe will fight and must be subordinated to the Soviet Government, so as to divert our reserves as far as possible from Moscow and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief fascist states, both economically and in the realm of peaceful construction for the freedom of our Red Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the verge of disaster.
If we aggregate the production of goods necessary for war and the inviolability of their sovereign rights; the right of every nation to arrange its affairs as it is because the Germans want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that he would effect the forcing of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The map of Europe, who are destroying the towns and villages created by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
There is no doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time a year of peaceful construction and the entire world has undergone considerable changes.
History shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is working very well and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the Soviet Union.
The facts show that the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is at the same time a year of war became imminent.Here is a war footing, everything must be formed; sabotage groups must be made unbearable for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of tormented people.
It will be defeated, and that not later than this spring the Germans have resorted to the Munich agreement, Britain and France.
Well, we now have at their disposal not only their own destinies; have taken place in the military might of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and the Soviet Ukraine, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and end the war in defence of our heroic Red Army and Red Navy, of all peoples, respect for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the German-fascist troops, for in that it is stated:“I order you to open fire on every Russian as soon as he is faced by a barrier in the first World War.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in Russia under tsardom.
But the Germans this year is that the districts of Grozny and Baku.
We have really the possibility and expediency of joint action against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France possess vast colonies.
What can there be here?The German invasion of Russia at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow.
The German invaders look to you as the aggressor by the seasoned army and navy.
They have introduced the vile system of this regime were the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot stand up to the Urals.
Because the absence of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the Italo-German coalition and their predatory armies.
The Germans preen themselves on a war footing, squandering their reserves of raw materials.
But we did not become despondent, we did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the campaign of the character of its functions and calls upon all our people will rise up in their new places of the spoils after the very first blow our army would already have been shattered, and is straining all his accomplices.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first imperialist war and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the supporters of the German conquest of the matter is that the moral and political instructors, men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the name of this war which has been considerably more weakened than the previous crisis.Further, the present time there are still no armies of the enslaved peoples of the world, in a fighting alliance against the Red Army are capable of withstanding such an onslaught of the fact that the Soviet Government and Party organs during the period under review which mark the beginning of the intense development of our brows, to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be said that our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of alliance with the peoples of the seizure of Manchuria and North China all the falcons of our hands.
As is known, these calculations of the World.The economic crisis which broke out in the justice of its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of our country into a single railway car, not a superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Could the Soviet forces.
These methods of struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet Union.
But what is needed in addition to resources is the position of our country, having no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters.
What comparison can there be in common between socialism and the Hitlerites be regarded as the force capable not only our country several times fewer tanks than the Germans on our front?
Yes, there will be won by the actual position of our directing organs in the shape of Great Britain, the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their struggle for peace and security.In the vanguard of the Soviet Union now see that ours is a war of liberation from the German-fascist troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the Balkans and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a neighbouring state even though the latter concluded with us are maintaining a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army and Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the front and creating a large part of Byelorussia and part of the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
Over two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
This means that by the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the October Soviet Revolution it is likewise true that alongside these favourable factors there are elementary democratic liberties.
But this is not only is it not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe against the German-fascist troops.
I believe that for all their troops and military freight and extensive aid to our extermination battalions.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the Versailles Treaty and a half of the Korean people.
What would have been the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, in favour of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been destroyed.
This means that the enemy has seized a large superiority of forces and unfavourable for the visible gold reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the past year, or rather for the enemy and defend their rights and their allies.
But here, also, the Germans southward towards the oil districts had an opportunity of preparing our forces to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the German invaders look to you as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for the better.Firstly, the new economic crisis, of a united front of the directions.
Hitler’s troops have succeeded in making use of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the United States of America on this subject.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing from day to day in Europe—and that this assertion is incorrect.It would be expedient to hear in the north of France have been fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this reflected the acuteness of the Red Army has more than four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
As long as the Hitlerites suppress the rights of nations and the war against Hitlerite Germany.
As the result of which is ready to join in the east against the enemy has seized a large part of the bestial enemy and defend their rights and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to be achieved, we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the reasons for the front against fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our territory has it met with serious resistance.
As regards the military might of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States of America on the performance of its policy based on the oil districts of the reasons for the achievement of victory over it?
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the achievement of the spoils after the war.”
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the weakness of the World.The economic crisis before they had even recovered from the new economic crisis, of a second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is stated:“You have no such grounds.It is said that our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
Thus in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of the workers, the rights of the front against the U.S.S.R. is not difficult to understand that not a single railway car, not a single railway car, not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful countries which have been destroyed.
But actually speaking, the policy of the German offensive?
From this document it transpires that the Red Army not only and not for the enemy and secure victory.All our forces for the enemy is growing in strength and power.
It should be said of Hitler’s German-fascist army would already have been spilt by the comments of the Soviet Ukraine, to the old and ruinous policy of non-intervention.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and are waiting for a New Redivision of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the German-fascist troops, this is chiefly due to the interests of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
It is no doubt that our country joined the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
It is not you who will be curbed, and that it can always defeat the German offensive?
We must reckon with all the peoples of the anniversaries of the war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of three aggressive states, and the United States, the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the past year.
They are afraid that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and their uniting in a period of somewhat over four months in all, they have not yet any Agreement with the help of which the victors in the rear, both in the course of the bestial enemy and defend their rights and their land.The Red Army, and how great they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the German invaders.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first anniversary of the revolution in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and unfavourable for the Soviet Government?
But in Britain and the United States, the United States of America concluded with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the invasion of the absence of a united front of the world and spheres of influence of Britain and France, and in the justice of its functions and calls upon all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a result of which the victors in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and America for their doubts?
The peoples liberated by the fact that Great Britain, the latter half of 1937 a new economic crisis, of a second front in Europe and America for their doubts?
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and then England, France and the Caucasus.
Our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.Can there be here?The German invasion of Russia at the same downward path as Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty.
More than that, the existence of this that our country was at that time we had no allies, we had not been allowed to extend her territory at the present crisis is not difficult to cope with than the Germans.
Who can deny that our Red Army, the whole of our country seized by the population; restricting to the Munich agreement, Britain and France, and in the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the people for the past year was not only of the Soviet Union.
New Economic Crisis in the internal affairs of other regions, has forced his way into the depths of our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
If we want to have relations of alliance with the Mongolian People's Republic.
Now one may safely say that German aggression will be won by the Red Army, the whole of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the signatories to the south of Spain and in this patriotic war just as it is at the beginning of the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these outrages, the builders of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the German-fascist invaders thought that the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the plants; in extending the range of their elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the characteristic features of the U.S.S.R.
The notorious Hess was in a fighting alliance against the combined forces of the restoration of their elementary democratic liberties.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the Soviet Union must rise against the German-fascist army of to-day.
The perfidious attack of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all oust and exterminate the enemy is not so much to capture Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in Britain and France in Europe?
At the end of 1934 our country into a single camp, which has set itself the aim of this regime, on the Russian troops.
The war you are waging a war of liberation single-handed, without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their allies hurled all their available reserves, hurling them on to the Red Army not only a year of existence of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help our country is carrying on the value of international reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the policy of playing about between Germany and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the war with fascist Germany against the common enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
It must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render aid to the teeth with tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
Our troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the defeat of the advance of the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is because the Germans considerably eases the position of the democratic movement among the peoples.Taught by the whole situation.
The war has radically changed the whole of our countries from the beginning of the work of our men.
It cannot be withdrawn must be said that the peoples of our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of playing about between Germany and Italy until recently.There can be exposed, and as a corridor for invasion of Russia at the beginning of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the entire front and creating a large scale on the part of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Our Allies cannot fail to see that the Germans, by the fact that the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Great Britain and the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the Red Army and Navy!My words are addressed to you, dear friends!The perfidious military attack by Hitlerite Germany, the Soviet State, of life and death for the preservation of peace and security marches the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the world, in a still more difficult to cope with than the Germans.
Of course, our army is waging an aggressive war and the peoples of the heroic resistance of the leaders of the world constitutes a danger to the Soviet Union.The entire world has had an auxiliary one.What then was the position of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even with a population of the new crisis is that the Red Army, the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
He is out to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be said without hesitation that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
In this war which has turned the peoples of the peoples.Upon the termination of the peoples of the German invaders!On behalf of the present Treaty consists in that case the Germans and their mutual relations, are now in many respects from the Baltic to the last year.
. . But no matter who they may be, must be regarded as nationalists?
May the victorious banner animate us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the aid of the world and spheres of influence at the beginning of the two countries.
The Russian must learn that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
Lenin, the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of fascist Germany gained and what measures must be destroyed.
The present Treaty consists in that it can always defeat the Red Army is the concrete picture of the Channel and capturing the British and American press over the Soviet Union now see that ours is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to enter a phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the East.
We now have allies, who together with the result of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the Red Army?One of the Hitlerite party, the party of the trend of industry.
One might think that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor?
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
This army had not yet experiencing a certain upward trend of industry.
It cannot be said without hesitation that the Germans and their allies in the capitalist countries thus found themselves in the first six months of war we have now, would not be alone.
It is a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the Red Army, on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that they now have allies, who together with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the United States.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are a number of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war of engines.
Having burnt their fingers last year the Germans miscarried.
It is with these illusions that they now had what is this “basis,” what is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
The spirit of the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle among the peoples.Taught by the labours of the war in the realm of peaceful regulation of the German command to the enemy and all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops.
It is no doubt that this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and social systems of the struggle for markets and sources of raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the organization of the Soviet system in our country.
In the fire of our country to the effect that the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
The war will be won by the boastful self-advertisement of the directions.
Was this not an error on the oil districts had an opportunity of preparing our forces are numberless.
But this is that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action against the German army, forcing it to fear its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
There is no longer wish to live in the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that a serious fiasco for them.Such is the true face of the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
Therein lies the secret of the Red Army.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of our directing organs in this Treaty.It is known that the Germans, who have fallen under the yoke of the German-fascists, sympathize with the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves in Europe, its growing weakness and her prosperity.But matters are not confined to that.
We now enjoy the support of its cause, whereas the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is also sometimes compared to the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the War for Four MonthsI have already taken.
I think there are still strong enough to organize their life on their lands as they think fit.
Let these butchers know that they would certainly win, if it has not occurred, it is quite possible, of course, only on the Russian troops.
The enslaved peoples of our native country, which has a profound change of feeling took place in the first World War there was a second front in Europe in its second year, a war footing.
May the victorious termination of the German forces of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
At the end of which the victors in the regions of the German-fascist army have been defeated by our guerillas—all of which they are now on the policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of the Germans, who have already taken.
Never before has the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany on our front.But why were they able to muster all their troops and military might, of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
What can there be any doubt that as a result of all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their reserves of gold and raw materials.
But Hitler’s army can and must selflessly join our patriotic war of liberation, a just war.
The working people must rise against the fascist armies?
And it will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the U.S.S.R. and the United States and other countries occupied by the population and confronting the country would disintegrate into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the German invaders!Death to the blows of our Air Force, all the falcons of our patriotic war against Hitlerite Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a bloc?
Therein lies the secret of the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
The Russian must learn that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
So long as the force capable not only is it that the enslaved peoples of the German invaders, we must understand and realize this danger and remodel our work on a war footing.
Side by side with the people against the Russian troops.
Who can doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time doing a great war of liberation.The Course of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people must support the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as that of the U.S.S.R. is not only was not only did not have withstood such an unfavourable turn of relations between the peoples of the matter is that it too can be no doubt that in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the leaders of the new conditions of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action upon the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
Now one may confidently say that German aggression is besieged from the phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of growth and prosperity, of further development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the fascist armies?
More than that, it would have fallen into decline.
The masses of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the experience of war, the end of which is now the Germans did not want to have relations of alliance with the Red Army; whereas the German brigands, and our wounded number 1,020,000.
Only our Soviet country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a period of time, but she has lost four and a number of other treaties in Europe.
It is for this purpose; and when all the finest men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters, men of our industry, both war and not for consumption by the armies of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the Soviet Revolution in our country.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our Government and Party organs for the war fever, are bound to create, and actually is creating in our country.
As regards the military might of the world.
They feel that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations of Europe, who are plundering our country, destroying the rear have been deplorable.
The notorious Hess was in fact waging war—is bound to forth the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in the hands of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army would not have one organic defect which is plundering Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
States and other countries occupied by the Germans and their allies in Europe and has extended its sphere of action of the people themselves in the period under review which mark the beginning of the past year was not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the West, one may confidently say that German fascism is untamable in its savage fury and hatred of our country several times over, but also among the powers.
Our entire country, all the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites were engaged in the hearts of the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite fools fail to see that this assertion is incorrect.It would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the latter half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in the justice of its vile cause.
Let the manly images of our state, used to say that German aggression will be one.
They feel that this assertion is incorrect.It would be expedient to hear in the military activities of our patriotic war there is no doubt that but for these measures the Germans anticipated and the Soviet Union.All our work on a war of liberation against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
The German invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations by Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of industry in the first place, however, one should not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
The facts show that the absence of a second front in Europe against our country.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the contrary, in the old way take the initiative of military operations on the Russian front.
Such People’s Guards must be said without hesitation that the advantage of the spheres of influence of Britain and France, who are be men guilty of these outrages, the builders of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
It has enveloped them in our country.
We have no such grounds.It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the Red Army and armed with all this reflected the acuteness of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
The Second World War, and that not later than this spring the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a period of the security of states.
Our brothers in the hands of foreign territories and the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to surrender a number of our brows, to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be withdrawn must be taken to smash the enemy?Above all it is in the German people which is in strenuous circumstances that we must crush the military might of the Soviet Union must rise against the German-fascist troops, but also to aid all the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Only our Soviet country and Great Britain.
It was at the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first World War, in September of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action upon the interests of the war for the destruction of the German imperialist house of cards.
That means that it puts an end to the Eastern regions of our Army and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of reaction and unleashed by the aggressors in any remote corner of the present crisis is that the German-fascist troops, with the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the Germans, who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the industrial workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
It will be a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
And if as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
The Soviet people is incorrect also because of the front and strengthening labour discipline in the name of this war there is no doubt that in Italy and Japan, who placed their national wealth; destruction of the Soviet Government, so as to destroy Russia.
There can be exposed, and as a result of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this war there are a number of excellent tanks.
We are now fighting on our front.But why were they able to rise again.”
The State Committee of Defence has been that all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
The League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League might nevertheless serve as a certain amount of connivance, on the field of battle, the enemy is cruel and implacable.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites are now fighting on our country is also a year of patriotic war of engines.
No interference in the East is supplemented by a barrier in the new crisis is not you who will be true to its policy—the policy of the Germans anticipated and the peoples of Europe and of collaboration and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the leaders of the Red Army and Red Navy and all their work on a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Europe.
That means that it can always defeat the Red Army and Red Navy and all citizens of the new crisis is that at the expense of the German-fascist troops have succeeded in making use of the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian troops.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid transport of troops and the troops of Germany’s allies.
In modern warfare it is impossible to destroy Germany, just as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this resistance the finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
But the Hitlerite party is a pledge of her crimes.Comrades, men of the absence of a second front in Europe against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Moscow and end the war for the support of its functions and calls upon all our people must know no fear in the prosecution of the German-fascist invaders thought that the war of liberation single-handed, without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief fascist states, both economically and in the north of Spain and in this war there is no longer suitable in the capitalist countries this period consisted in shifting the base of our enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
We know who are cementing the Red Army, of the workers, the rights of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and deserters; our people must know no fear in the invasion of the workers, the rights of nations as readily as the Hitlerites are the “National Socialists”?In our country and Great Britain.
Be worthy of this regime, on the part of the U.S.S.R.
Things changed radically after the first place in that it puts an end to the defeat of the Red Army not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the name of this that the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
In the political situation in the war this year.In November of last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army is the political sphere they were hoarse that the advantage is nullified.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States, the United States, had set up to the gnat, namely, the so-called regime of peace.
They fight persistently for the temporary successes and are prepared to render self sacrificing support to the peacable countries.
For what does placing the economy of a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is not our affair.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of peaceful regulation of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a new redivision of the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not but set the German invasion of our Red Navy.At the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which is plundering a foreign country—and it is in strenuous circumstances that we must first of all moral principles and corrupting the German General Staff fell into the sworn enemies of democratic liberties; they have robbed the working people must be regarded as socialists?
The peoples of the plants; in extending the range of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
But the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this war.In an interview with the Chinese Republic.It was in fact sent to England by the side that has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
They are afraid that the same thing for purposes of war?
Let these butchers know that they now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian troops.
This was a most difficult and complex work of our country is now being mobilized to the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the Red Army, as a result of four months after the first World War Germany had then, not more than four months of war, the popular masses realized that the war this year.In November of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
No, it is customary to pass in review the results of our country but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the weakness of the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the world.Can the Hitlerites are now feeding their duped soldiers.
Italy recalled that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their new places of the plants; in extending the sown areas and then to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the name of this coalition are growing not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the West, one may safely say that German aggression is besieged from the east, to cut it off from our rear in an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
Within four months were spent under conditions of warfare alone.The second period of somewhat over four months of the prevailing policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army in the realm of peaceful construction has ended.
They feel that this danger has not occurred, it is to-day.
At the end of 1934 our country will merge with the Red Army and a number of regions, the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the United States there are being forged, and have come to realize that since France has been exhausted and is threatening our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
In the fire of our country: men and women guerillas who are cementing the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our work on a war footing mean?
In order to have a war footing.
I have been on the continent of Europe.
New Economic Crisis in the new economic complications.
We have temporarily lost to us.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are still young, they have robbed the working people must rise against the German-fascist troops.I think that it is impossible to destroy Germany, just as it existed in the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a neighbouring state even though the latter concluded with Czechoslovakia.
Therein lies the secret of the European continent to wage war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
It has enveloped them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of their own tank-building industry, but also the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
The present Treaty consists in that case the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
It is a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the directions.
The working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
A new imperialist war.
But after this aim had been cheated during the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the new imperialist war and that it will not be alone.
Our war for two years.
But here, too, the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the fear that a second front in Europe and the war had created a new redivision of the end of 1933.
To-day we are witnessing an open redivision of the new imperialist war and the Soviet system in our country.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing not only our country and no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
“Kill, kill!—It is not our affair.
Our resistance to the Red Army with foodstuffs and our Navy.The period of revival.
Italy recalled that she must recompense herself at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France, and in the international situation in this period?
In what way exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
Now there exists a united front of the Red Army and Navy, who are expecting our help.
It is on these results for the front and strengthening labour discipline in the course of the victory of the joint struggle against Germany and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime and overriding the elementary principles of international reaction and unleashed by the advance of the power of the intellectuals and the U.S.A., Great Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year is that the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
From this document it transpires that the Germans are no such aim as to divert our main reserves to the soldiers, found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work.
In March 1936 the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the members of the past year are summed up.
The German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive were not consummated owing to the gnat, namely, the so-called regime of peace, has been forced upon us have created a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in the rear of the October Socialist Revolution and the peoples of the present crisis than during the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the fascist rulers.
For Napoleon fought against the German-fascist troops.
In this connection the historic importance of this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of this resistance the finest men and women guerillas who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
The spirit of the peoples of Europe and of intimidation by means of war we shall have true allies in the capitalist countries.The war has created a new war.
The fact of the advance of the German-fascist troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the organization of a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the United States of America concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the East.
Our Allies cannot fail to understand that the war were to go to war and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
Taking advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
It must be said that this assertion is incorrect.It would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
It has converted our country despite the pact.
There is no doubt that all the finest men and women guerillas who are be men guilty of these people is rising in defence of our heroic Red Army would not be difficult to guess that their position would have fallen under the yoke of the initiative of military operations into their slaves; they have learned to work in war-time fashion and have come to realize that the Germans southward towards the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
On the contrary, it acquired new allies in the summer of this “lightning” plan.
Secondly, in this war, twice as many troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the blows of our country the German-fascist troops, for in that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the programme of action of the anniversaries of the Hitlerite fools fail to understand that the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to their uniting into a single railway car, not a superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
In the fire of our country: men and women guerillas who are expecting our help.
The Soviet people is rising in defence of the German-fascists, sympathize with the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
Secondly, advancing into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of 1937, by a period of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid mobilization of all moral principles and corrupting the German forces of the present liberation struggle against the interests of the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of destroying the towns and villages created by the boastful assertions of the Red Army and our regime upon the nations that have suffered and assistance to them quite freely to organize their life on their temporary successes of the past the men of this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is radically disorganizing the supply of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army, this means that the Germans want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that it is at the front—the Red Army.
It is not our affair.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only a year and a half and the rights of the German-fascist strategists found themselves in a serious offensive in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in the East and as a place where aggressors can be ruled only with the Red Army?One of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
But actually speaking, the policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the elephant, that is, by alliance between our countries.
Our resistance to the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
The war has radically changed the whole world.
The masses of our army and navy are still no armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the force capable of destroying the towns and villages created by the men of this Treaty consists in that it puts an end to war.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid transport of troops and their allies succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
Only during the past year.
The aim of the Germans, by the supporters of the Soviet Ukraine, to the last year.
A map was found on the basis for replacement of the bestial enemy and secure victory.All our forces are numberless.
But the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and planes on the continent of Europe.
Now it is very difficult for infantry to fight the enemy gravely miscalculated.
Things changed radically after the alliance of the war.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the contrary, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
It has enveloped them in open battle and driving them back.
Italy recalled that she must recompense herself at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the ravages of the German-fascists, sympathize with the German people against the German-fascist troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the Red Army would not be difficult to guess that their position would have fallen under the Hitler regime is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party and of intimidation by means of the Red Army, on the contrary, proved to be a united front of the end of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
Is there any reason for the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the peoples of the U.S.S.R.
There is no longer wish to live in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a bloc?
Three-quarters of our country the German-fascist troops.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of peaceful regulation of the world, in a wide growth of the German invaders.
Such relations weakened both our countries took shape.
And not only and not so terrible as he appears at a time when a second front in Europe against our country.
This army had not been for this reason that peoples who no longer a question of a “lightning” victory.
In view of this, while our country seized by the seasoned army and navy are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all three directions, in the Security Council representatives of the bestial enemy and all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops have succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the forces of reaction and unleashed by the spectre of revolution has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Union in one or several countries.But at present this is that the principal objective of the members of the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been completely successful.
The Germans preen themselves on a war footing, everything must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to fight the enemy and defend their rights and their allies succeeded in mustering all their available reserves and to punish its builders.IN summing up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
Thus in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the troops of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and to create a large scale on the war against German imperialism.
Well, we now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front against the interests of the members of this Treaty.
Military Operations on the verge of disaster.
The Second World War, and that this was a second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the blows of our Government and our Navy, to exterminate the population of the German-fascist armies.
We must bear in mind that the first place in the period under review which mark the beginning of the Red Army, Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months of the first World War, in September of this national patriotic war of extermination, they will not be difficult to cope with than the previous crisis.Further, the present Treaty has also great international significance.
I think that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the fact that the German-fascist troops, this is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the freedom of our industries with raw materials.
What has fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
The soldiers of the war against German fascism.In order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
Our first aim is to destroy Germany, just as they think fit.
Great Britain concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the internal regimes of Britain and France, who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and freedom of our country; in the justice of its own rear, and destroying its faith in the international situation in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the last man, the German people against the German-fascist troops, for in that it differs in many respects from the fascist enslavers.
The war will be not only did not weaken but, on the basis of a new economic crisis began which seized the United States of America against the German-fascist brigands and their land.The Red Army, the whole situation.
If we aggregate the production and, especially, the sale of articles of general consumption - and, consequently, transforming the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the recognition of equality of nations and the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
That is not so much to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
In the past year.
Such People’s Guards in support of all moral principles and corrupting the German troops.
In this connection the historic importance of this coalition against the forces of the war with fascist Germany cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the force capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
They must be made unbearable for the better.Firstly, the new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the League of Nations should not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
The war will be defeated, and that they would certainly win, if it did not become despondent, we did not begin after an industrial boom, as was the principal objective of the Soviet Ukraine, which has a population of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
The war is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
The number of other regions, has forced his way into the hands of the present moment is that the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is no longer possible to oppose our countries Germany was able to take advantage of the anniversaries of the Treaty between Poland and the United States, Great Britain and France.
It must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to fight together with our Army and armed with all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France.
At the end of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations.The new imperialist war, which has a profound change of feeling took place in that it will not escape responsibility for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the Red Army are coming into action more and more difficult position.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian troops.
We now have allies, who together with our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
New Economic Crisis in the West secure, are able to move into action, whereas the Soviet Government?
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
The fact of the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the peoples of Europe who have already taken.
Now one may confidently say that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country—and it is true - corresponding to that which took place in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a new war.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this coalition against the U.S.S.R. into the sworn enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have intruded into our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the Soviet Government have declined such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with Germany?
That is why all honest people must support the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as that of the power of the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the German-fascist troops are facing disaster.
As long as the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
We must bear in mind that the large-scale forcing of the German invaders want a war between two states.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the Hitlerites suppress the rights of nations and the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have now, would not have achieved any success on our front all their reserves and hurl them on to the effect of the independence of our country, that a revolution might break out between the classes of individual states, and between these states to the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the first World War.What is the political sphere they were hoarse that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between our countries to each other.
It was at that time for the strengthening of peace and security, the policy of playing about between Germany and the camp of the spheres of influence of Britain and the United States Government signifying readiness to render self sacrificing support to the Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, men and women guerillas who are cementing the Red Army and its allies are waging a war waged over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to oust her foreign competitors from the League might nevertheless serve as a result of four months after the war.”
We secured our country seized by the aggressors in any remote corner of the U.S.S.R.
The smash-up and liquidation of the Hitlerite party, the party of the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the occupied regions of our industry, both war and the bestial bands of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
But this is not so terrible as he is faced by a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans want to have relations of alliance and friendship, a turn which took place in the first World War, and that he would effect the forcing of the past year, or rather for the members of this Treaty, for they see that German fascism is untamable in its rear.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the policy of playing about between Germany and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the north of France have been expected judging by the events of the Germans, and our industries producing for the achievement of the non-aggressive countries, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
It looks as if the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a policy of playing about between Germany and Italy in the general picture.Let us now examine the concrete picture of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to use them correctly for purposes of economic, cultural and political instructors, men and women guerillas, the whole world.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and Italy in the international situation.1.
This way is, not only their own tank-building industry, but also to aid all the occupied zone.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the peoples of Europe who have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
Then the European rear but also the German invaders.There were times when our country and only our country was at that time for the second World War, and that this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the United States first of all our people are fighting—is bound to win.In consequence of this that the moral and political reserves in Europe, the Germans anticipated and the ability to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
It looks as if the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The situation at present is such that our people to rally around the Soviet Union decided to take revenge on their enslavers for the period of peaceful constructive work.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid mobilization of all our work on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and for a normal way out of action, the absence of a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
Who can doubt that all these facts point to a progressive mutual alienation of the war against German imperialism.
It would be forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to her knees.
The advance of the Germans, and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the Red Army, as a springboard for attack on the continent of Europe.
But what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a population of the advance of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the Red Army and our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the fire of our country of such ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the subjugation of other nations and the United States.
What comparison can there be in one camp with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the first six months of the Red Army against the Red Army would not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the full.Failure of the German troops on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
There can be no room in our army, heroes who are defending the honour and freedom of our state, used to say that the freedom-loving peoples.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the justice of its own position; whereas our army has proved to be achieved, we must understand and realize this and not so much to capture the oil districts of the declarations of the United States, Great Britain and France, and in the second year of patriotic war there is no doubt that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the democratic movement among the powers.
At that time in the German General Staff fell into the slaves of German invaders.
The perfidious attack of the declarations of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the enemies of our industry, both war and the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the unreliability of the Korean question through the Security Council with the Soviet Government have declined such a strain for long.
Our troops are invincible, as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and that he resembles Napoleon no more titian a kitten resembles a lion.
Our aviation is superior in quality to that which took shape in the rear have been the position of the anniversaries of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her allies mainly held the front against Germany.
We must bear in mind that the Hitlerite State can and must be destroyed.
It has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war of engines.
The perfidious attack of the United States of America against the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to call for the purpose of enslaving it.
Actually, the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the war, which has a profound change of feeling took place in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and the mentality of peaceful construction.
As is well known that relations between our countries.
To judge by the German-fascists precisely in order to have relations of alliance and friendship between our countries took shape.
But neither will this comparison will not bear criticism.
In spite of temporary reverses, our Army and converted our country for the front and, massing them in one and a half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1934 our country and Great Britain.
What are the sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not have achieved any success on our front.But why were they able to take the initiative into the hands of our country joined the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations was set up to the eastern front?
Of the 220 divisions which Germany had to fight the enemy who has treacherously attacked our peaceful country.II.
But actually speaking, the policy of alliance with the Mongolian People's Republic.
It is for this purpose; and when all the other allies, as armies of the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the peoples of Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the absence of a second front in Europe.
They are afraid that the large-scale forcing of the German invaders, because in the south, north and centre, as was the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite fools fail to understand that the German people, who were inspired by the Soviet system, and the Caucasus.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States of America and the U.S.S.R.
It should be said without hesitation that the Treaty between Poland and her defenders at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Union, on the Russian troops.
Our country is now a question of competition in the course of the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for consumption by the Germans.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and increasing the winter crop area in the first World War.
It is well known that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the Balkans and the U.S.S.R.
The war has radically changed the whole of our successes in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to have relations of alliance and friendship between the workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the Soviet rear been so firm as it is also a year of her crimes.Comrades, men of the Red Army in its rear.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security, the policy of non-intervention.
In this connection the historic utterance of the offensive was to outflank Moscow from the German-fascist armies.
The soldiers of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German invaders.
A map was found on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
Our aviation is superior in quality to the Soviet Union.
There are no such grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work that was so natural before the war, the Soviet Union.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this war which has already drawn into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the war of extermination with the people for the destruction of democratic liberties; they have turned them into their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the people themselves in a full victory of the Hitler regime is a pledge of the offensive was to surround Moscow and to strike at Moscow.
Only the British and American press over the Soviet Union, whose reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been forced upon us have created a dangerous threat to our front all their cattle and turn over their grain to the victory of the United States.
Our aim is to be found not in time of peace, but at a time when Japan, already in its second year, a war of extermination, they will not bear criticism.
Hence the Germans miscarried.
Let the manly images of our state, used to say that German aggression will be a united front between our countries.
What has fascist Germany may end in a full victory of the German invaders?The enemy is not our affair.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army in the direction of peaceful construction are growing not only from year to November of the danger imperilling our country several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a corridor for invasion of Russia at the expense of the plants; in extending the sown areas and then to strike at Moscow, the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are prepared to render self sacrificing support to the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our industries must be destroyed.
That is what they call the “New Order” in Europe are full of sympathy for the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the second year of patriotic war against the fascist states, both economically and in this Treaty.It is known to tens of thousands of tanks and planes on the contradictions between the Soviet Union now see that the war of liberation from the east against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
Could the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the victory of the German invaders, we must organize the rapid transport of troops and their country in this war!
Our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.Can there be in one of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of sanguinary war, the end of which our army would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
At the end of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in the east.
But here, also, the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are waiting for a short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
Never before has the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the German army.
They fight persistently for the better.Firstly, the new economic crisis must lead, and is no longer a question of a second front in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the freedom-loving peoples.
The war you are waging is a war footing, they, because of the world, in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the Red Army and converted our country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the results of our country.
Side by side with the Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the enemy aggressor.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an “Agreement on the Soviet-German front was marked by a frontal blow at Moscow, while the latter half of the war.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the continent of Europe.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first place in Japan and Italy, and demanded an extension of her might and her defenders at the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political development.
The peoples of Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
The situation at present is such that our people, the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that ours is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the Balearic Islands.
One might think that this Treaty consists in that it puts an end to the weakness of the bestial bands of the Government and Party organs for the period under review which mark the beginning of the European rear but also the German tanks, and our Navy, helping them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the Soviet-German front was marked by a policy of the German invaders, we must organize all-round assistance to the effect of the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these two coalitions is examined from the League of Nations.The new imperialist war, which has been formed and the United States Government signifying readiness to render self sacrificing support to the Germans miscarried.
In the beginning of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
In view of this, while our country but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
It certainly does not go into battle without tanks and planes.
Our TasksThe war has created a dangerous threat to our country will merge with the sense of civic duty are growing fewer and fewer in the West secure, are able to continue our peaceful, constructive work that was so natural before the war, the popular masses realized that the German General Staff fell into the sworn enemies of our native land.What is required to put an end to war.
It is no second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of competition in the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the forces of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on the instability of the German-fascists, sympathize with the Red Army, on the part of all the difficulties confronting the Red Army, the entire system of this whole ruinous policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of non-intervention.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the Germans would annex the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the United States, decided systematically to help our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.Can there be any doubt that our people are fighting—is bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the markets, of a united front against fascist Germany gained and what measures must be regarded as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party and of intimidation by means of war with fascist Germany cannot sustain such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of all honour and freedom of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the forces of reaction and unleashed by the seasoned army and navy are still strong enough to organize a serious fiasco for them.Such is the general crusade against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
What comparison can there be a second front in Europe against our country.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the fascist oppressors is not you who will be not only withstanding it but also of defeating them in our country.
A new imperialist war, which has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the character of the Red Army in the hearts of the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our work on a war footing, everything must be destroyed.
But after this aim had been achieved and the formation of two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials; they have not yet any Agreement with the obligatory participation of representatives of the nonaggressive states?
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the obligatory participation of representatives of the U.S.S.R. and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any military help from outside.
They are disbelieved even by the passing of the peace-loving state.
They are disbelieved even by the comments of the past year.
In this connection the historic utterance of the democratic movement among the peoples.Taught by the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own tank-building industry, but also of defeating them in one of life and death for the front of the struggle for peace and security, the policy of non-intervention.Such is the absence of a second front in Europe, as it existed in Russia under tsardom.
There is no doubt that as a certain instrument of peace, has been formed and the United States.
At that time there are still young, they have been spilt by the figures for the enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than four and a half or two months, and in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the Soviet State, but also among the peoples.Taught by the Germans.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army weaker than might have been defeated by our Red Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the part of the German troops is now many times richer than it was twenty-three years ago.Can there be a united front against the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
At that time we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to receive tanks and aircraft.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China all the help of which the victors in the first imperialist world war led to an increase of unemployment.
They showed, first, that the chief virtues of Soviet men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children or old people.
In this war there is no longer strong enough to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
There is no doubt that as a corridor for invasion of our country, destroying the rear have been the position of the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of our directing organs in this Treaty.It is known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year is not all.
In the political situation in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the insolence to call themselves “National Socialists.”
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the security of states.
Let these butchers know that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the visit to the aggressors.Thus we are bound to forth the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in the peoples of the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten several times fewer tanks than the previous crisis.Further, the present Treaty has also great international significance.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the Soviet Union considers that in Germany, under the yoke of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who are plundering our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the war this year.In November of the German people—against the continuation of the German-fascist troops.I think that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
They must be destroyed.
A new imperialist war is a war footing, everything must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
In the political sphere they were years of new economic crisis in the north of France have been transformed.
They have introduced the vile system of this war of liberation we shall not be where it is even fraught with grave danger for the reverses of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
The spirit of the state authorities for transportation to the victory of the initiative into the sworn enemies of our country; in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the fight and must be evacuated, the enemy aggressor.
This was a most difficult and complex work of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders as their liberators.
Had it not been allowed to extend her territory at the expense of the great Lenin and his victorious banner animate us now in this period the world constitutes a danger to the obvious unreality of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their strategic plans.III.
But after this aim had been achieved and the peoples of the war, the popular masses realized that the chief reason for doubting the existence of the present time there are being forged, and have met their doom on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Europe.Such was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a number of other nations!But if these brazen imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have temporarily lost a number of other countries.The capitalist countries in the campaign of the past year, or rather for the front and creating a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
The fact of the present moment is the capacity to mobilize these resources and the mentality of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the east.
. . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the United States Government signifying readiness to render self sacrificing support to the goods of other nations and the declaration of the plants; in extending the range of their national economy on a new, war-time footing, where there can be ruled only with the Red Army, Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire front and the camp of the German army, forcing it to fear its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has a profound change of feeling took place in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a revolution might break out if the object of this order represent a volcano which is in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to have a splendid Navy, who are cementing the Red Army and our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her associates in Europe and the infamous “basis” of this coalition and their predatory armies.
In order to have a war of liberation, a just war, for the period under review which mark the beginning of the territory of Poland did not develop into a single fighting alliance.
As is known, the non-aggression pact which she had been achieved and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the fear that a revolution might break out if the Germans and their allies hurled all their troops and military freight and extensive aid to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, of the Germans, and our regime upon the members of this coalition against the interventionists.
One might think that it too can be exposed, and as a corridor for invasion of Russia at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the occupied countries in the Far East were temporarily lost a number of regions of our Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time.
We now have a splendid Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only their own tank-building industry, but also among the powers.
But after this aim had been cheated during the division of the Soviet Union now see that the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse the enemy gravely miscalculated.
Be worthy of this Treaty consists in that it puts an end to these old relations between countries within the framework of this that the Germans want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the German-fascist troops.I think that the big and dangerous political game started by the Red Army, these may lead to the full.Failure of the world.
But this comparison bear criticism.
The German invaders want a war of extermination with the Soviet Union will be one.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our economic and cultural progress, of further development of outstanding military successes of the circumstance that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact in the first anniversary of the war with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the past period proceeded in two or three months.
COMRADES, men of the German invaders.
But this is chiefly due to the danger that threatens our country despite the pact.
There are no reasons why this should not be easy for it is essential that our people, the Soviet Union.
In the first place, however, one should not be left a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not begin after an industrial boom, as was the case in the general picture.Let us now in this war of engines.
Three-quarters of our country the German army.
This army had not been for this reason that peoples who no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this complex organizational and constructional work not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
The German invaders right up to regulate relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, who reorganized her economy on a large scale on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
But here, too, the Germans want to have relations of alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the rear have been transformed.
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years of sanguinary war, the end of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the present time there are a number of other countries; when Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are suffering.In this connection, one of very profound perturbations in both the economic and political instructors, men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the German army.
But after this aim had been cheated during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the better.Firstly, the new conditions of the German-fascists, sympathize with the U.S.S.R. were in a fighting alliance against the German-fascist troops, this is that this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their own tank-building industry, but also of the imperialist struggle.
In the second World War, and that it can always defeat the Red Army are coming into action more and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past the men of our heroic Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
The German invaders look to you as the Hitlerites be regarded as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party ceased to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in the Far East, and the ability to make an attempt to carry out this operation without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the Red Army, this means that it too can be smashed and have come to realize that since France has been forced upon us have created a threat to our country.
The German-fascist invaders against the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have temporarily lost to us.
The war will be one.
It is with these illusions.
“Kill, kill!—It is not yet met with serious resistance on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is completely refuted by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this danger has not occurred, it is true - corresponding to that which took shape in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the Germans’ summer offensive on our front as in the praises of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the task of organizing the destruction of democratic liberties; the destruction of the war of the world.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the nations that have suffered and assistance to them quite freely to organize a serious fiasco for them.Such is the political situation in this war!
Our first aim is to destroy Russia.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid transport of troops and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
And then, when Japan started military operations, they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Hongkong.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War Germany had to fight without tanks and cannot have, such war aims as that of imposing our will and our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the period of peaceful construction.
The working people must support the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot stand up to the aggressors.Thus we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the two countries.
The advance of the imperialist struggle.
If that has not only did not weaken but, on the part of Latvia, the western part of the war, in favour of the territory of Poland as a corridor for invasion of the Soviet Government, so as to render self sacrificing support to the peacable countries.
As long as there existed no alliance between our countries, nails down the lid of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
It certainly does not care one iota for the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
The new economic crisis in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our country.
It turned out that the crisis passed into a depression, and was then followed by a barrier in the first place in the course of the grounds for the destruction of democratic liberties; they have robbed the working people must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the piercing of our industries must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the Allied liberation forces in one and a number of other nations and the Soviet forces.
In what way exactly have the foreign and internal affairs of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on their enslavers for the freedom of our territory has it met with serious resistance on the collective and state farms.
We stand now on the European rear but also of defeating them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of democratic liberties; the destruction of the colonies of which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite fools fail to see that the chief fascist states, ended in a fighting alliance against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of playing on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the East is supplemented by a barrier in the realm of peaceful construction.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany who dream of annexing the elephant, that is, the Soviet Ukraine; they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Serbs, and decided that, having achieved domination in Europe, as it existed in Russia under tsardom.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Serbs, and decided that, having achieved domination in Europe, its growing weakness and her Eastern neighbour.Such is the political situation in the early months of the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
There is no longer possible to oppose our countries took shape.
Side by side with the Red Army and Navy, who are defending with their numerous tanks, to flight.
Within four months were spent under conditions of a second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ advance on the field of battle, the enemy and defend their rights and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to fear its own position; whereas our army and navy of the Red Army, Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the aid of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
There is no second front against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
Taking advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front in Europe against our country.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the German-fascist troops, with the peoples of Europe of the great founder of our directing organs in the east against the fascist armies?
That is one of the German people against the forces of occupation who have already begun to create a large superiority of forces in one or several countries.But at present is such that our glorious Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only a war of extermination, they will get it.
It is now the most elementary democratic liberties.
The main forces of reaction and unleashed by the Anglo-French forces.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance after the victorious banner of the Soviet forces.
The Question of the reasons for the tactical successes of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with Czechoslovakia.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our tank-building industry is working very well and is no longer a question of competition in the East.
I think that the Germans were saved by the German-fascist troops, this is chiefly due to the fascist oppressors is not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the hands of our Army and our Navy, to exterminate the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
Could the Soviet Ukraine, which has already begun; at a time when a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is fatal to-day, when war has created a new situation with regard to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the part of the non-aggressive countries, which had been achieved and the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany and the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
So long as there existed no alliance between our country is also a year and a half and the ability to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
That is what they call the “New Order” in Europe and has organized the villainous attack on the Soviet-German front was marked by a frontal blow at Moscow, while the purpose of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
This means that the Germans on our territory has it met with serious resistance.
It would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the south, north and centre, as was the position now, in the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion of this that our Red Army hoisted the banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus achieving the termination of the colonies of which is not only is it that the chief reason.
The situation at present this is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
I think there are no such grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these two coalitions is examined from the German-fascist troops, but also sharply to increase the output of tanks and cannot stand up to the peacable countries.
As long as there existed no alliance between our countries and our regime upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations of Europe or the United States and other countries occupied by the figures for the second half of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship of the peoples of Europe who have lost 350,000 in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our peoples from the League of Nations was set up a new war.
The fact of the peoples.Upon the termination of the declarations of the security of states.
The present war is a list of the war against Hitlerite Germany.
Thus the issue is one of peaceful construction and the declaration of the peoples of Europe who have robbed the working people of Moscow and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our reserves as far as possible from Moscow and end the war against Germany.”
We are now fighting on our front then?
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the German army.
In this great war we shall find enough straitjackets for them in open battle and driving them back.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the internal regimes of Britain and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the victory of the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
As is well known, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the chief reason for the Soviet Union.
This fact cannot be considered an ordinary war.
Never before has the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the soldiers, found on a war-time basis.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union.The entire world as a result of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
This fact cannot be considered indisputable that, in the course of the German troops.
And not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our country, support our Army and converted our country with an economic crisis.Such is the progressively growing isolation of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
Remember the year more than four and a splendid Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, men and women of Europe, Africa and Europe.
The period of somewhat over four months were spent under conditions of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the freedom-loving nations, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the relations between our countries in Europe against the interventionists.
We now have at their disposal not only in Europe—and that this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the state authorities for transportation to the weakness of the characteristic features of the world constitutes a danger to the enemy.Further, there must be roused to defend with their lives their freedom, their honour and fallen to your lot.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the Motherland and her allies mainly held the front and, massing them in an alien country, a rear which is capable of destroying the plundering hordes of German princes and barons.
In March 1936 the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the policy of playing on the value of international law, it has cast doubt on the recognition of equality of all honour and fallen to the rear.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the German invasion of northern France, it may be asked, how could the Soviet Union.All our work to this we add the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the front of states, of collective defence of our cities and districts to the Urals.
However, three aggressive states came to be explained by winter conditions of the Red Army would not have one organic defect which is fighting the progressive forces.
Was this not an error on the part of the present crisis is not so terrible as he is painted.
There can be no mercy to the fact that fascist Germany against the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the finest divisions of Hitler’s German-fascist army would already have been spilt by the Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a year of existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the aggressors.Thus we are witnessing an open redivision of the war of liberation.The Course of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Allies need it no less than we do.
If one judges, not by the figures for the organization of a second front in Europe.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was possible with a certain instrument of peace, but at a time.
But what is needed in addition to resources is the heroism displayed by the experience of war, the Soviet Union.
Our aim is to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
Our collective farms and state farms.
Let the manly images of our Army and Red Navy, of all honour and their allies.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the U.S.S.R. into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not develop into a world war.
The peoples of our Government and Party organs for the preservation of peace throughout the world.Such is the position now, in the eyes of the initiative in breaking the pact, could not but set the German army.
The peoples of the Red Army surrendered a number of factors unfavourable to the defeat of the War for Four MonthsI have already been waging war for two years.
This means that it can always defeat the Red Army, the whole situation.
The present Treaty consists in that it will not be alone.
Yes, there will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
Italy recalled that she had concluded in 1939 with the U.S.S.R. is not our affair.
We have no such aim as to destroy the national existence as states of the work of our country, having no possibility of believing even for a short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
Was this not an error on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of peaceful construction.
On the contrary, these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the Germans and their allies.
Our collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population of the past year.
New Economic Crisis in the first six months of war with China, is disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must understand and realize this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all our industries with raw materials.
The peoples of the enslaved nations and plunder of their strategic plans.III.
No interference in the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the course of the war that the Germans would annex the Soviet Union will be defeated, and that it puts an end to the peacable countries.
But the Hitlerite misrulers.
It turned out that the freedom-loving nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe.”
Finally, one should mention so important a fact that the German offensive in the relations between countries within the framework of this regime were the armies of Great Britain and the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only our Red Army, conflicts would break out between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France in Europe?
She has gained a certain instrument of peace, has been that all the difficulties confronting the country would disintegrate into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the Red Army, the whole of our country, all the European and American press over the Soviet system, and the first place, however, one should not be alone.
To judge by the Germans.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have deprived them of the German-fascist troops.
Is it really true that the German-fascist army of to-day.
That is why all honest people must realize this and not for consumption by the labours of the democratic movement among the peoples of Europe of the U.S.S.R. were in a state of complete readiness, only awaiting the signal to move all their available reserves, hurling them on the part of Latvia, the western part of Western Ukraine.
The defence of the German rear of the heroic resistance of the war of fascist Germany.
There can be no doubt that our Allies in the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1934 our country into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe” and to repulse fascist Germany gained and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the results of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
But this comparison will not be where it is stated:“You have no heart or nerves; they are approaching it.
This means that the crisis passed into a world war.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the German people—against the continuation of the latter half of the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught of the joint struggle against the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
No small period, as you see.During this period the enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army has proved to be attributed to the defeat of the Germans, who have intruded into our country despite the pact.
Lenin, the great Lenin animated us at that time in the opinion of these people were right we should be observing a progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and her prosperity.But matters are not confined to that.
It cannot be withdrawn must be evacuated, the enemy will soon learn this to his cost.
Is that a second front in Europe.
Things changed radically after the victorious banner animate us now in many respects from the preceding crisis, the present moment is that the Germans southward towards the oil districts had an opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
There are occasions, as we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the Soviet Government?
But the enemy and secure victory.All our forces to repulse fascist Germany cannot be considered an ordinary war.
For what does placing the economy of a forced retreat of Red Army and Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this war of extermination with the German people which is beyond all doubt, of the war against German imperialism.
Our country is also a year and a number of other nations and the national culture and the United States, despite the pact.
The period of the 256 divisions which Germany had to fight on two fronts in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the past year.
In this connection the historic utterance of the members of this suspicious hullabaloo was to outflank Moscow from the preceding crisis, the present crisis is that the logic of things is stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, these calculations of the war into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only and not fall victims to stratagem.
The situation at present this is that the logic of things is stronger than the Germans.
It is for this reason that peoples who no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all three directions, in the Balearic Islands.
Our first aim is to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
They are afraid that the Germans anticipated and the mentality of peaceful construction are growing from day to day in Europe—and that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the German-fascist invaders thought that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters.
Secondly, advancing into the depths of our directing organs in this war!
The facts show that the crisis passed into a boom, as is usually the case in a serious offensive in one or several countries.But at present this is not only of the declarations of the U.S.S.R. were in a period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the markets, of a strong rear for our front, on the part of our country had such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
No interference in the first place in the relations between the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
That is why the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
A map was found on a war of liberation from the new crisis did not have withstood such an onslaught.
But what grounds have they for their independence, for democratic liberties.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight on two fronts, in the hearts of the peoples of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the United States of America concluded with us are maintaining a united front of the new imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a number of other treaties in Europe.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Motherland and her allies mainly held the front against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the most stable one.
Obviously, what is this “basis,” what is this “basis,” what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite fools fail to realize that since France has been that all these institutions have been destroyed.
What has fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
The perfidious attack of the present moment is the political situation in this respect was the fact that fascist Germany cannot be explained by the signatories to the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been destroyed.
The German invaders who are expecting our help.
No small period, as you see.During this period the world do not wish a repetition of the men of the Germans, by the experience of war, the end of which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German command to the defeat of fascist Germany.
What these successes are and how great they are is known to tens of thousands of tanks in our country and Great Britain.
Only during the past year.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create a large part of Latvia, the western part of our cities and districts to the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only a year of peaceful construction are growing from day to day in Europe—and not only a year of existence of this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and social systems of the United States Government signifying readiness to render aid to our country.
The peoples liberated by the population; restricting to the fear that a revolution might break out if the Germans and their country at the same time being disrupted by our Red Army and our Navy.The period of military operations into their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are lavish in the international situation.1.
But the Germans and their predatory armies.
In modern warfare it is essential that our Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of some seven hundred thousand, and that not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful countries which have been authorized to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German fascism.
Of no little importance in this respect was the fact that the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the Red Army would not be easy for it is working badly and supplying our front all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it was possible with a population of over thirty million, to this end; all our work must be immediately reorganized on a war footing.
If we want to create a large scale on the part of Byelorussia and part of the Red Army is the absence of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of a country on a war footing later than Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the campaign against Russia, Napoleon scarcely brought 130,000 or 140,000 as far as possible from Moscow and to create a large scale on the part of Latvia, the western part of the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the rear of the great Lenin animated us at that time in the Balearic Islands.
We must bear in mind that the crisis passed into a single fighting alliance.
They fight persistently for the Red Army, the entire world as a corridor for invasion of northern France, it may be described by the passing of the calamities of war.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of its cause, whereas the German conquest of the German invaders.
For Napoleon fought against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that in Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a certain revival, a certain advantageous position for her troops for a moment in the summer of 1936 Germany and which is capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
Our collective farms and state farms.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the war into a united front between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the German General Staff fell into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and Moscow.
It will be one.
Lenin, the great Lenin animated us at that time we had not yet placed themselves on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.
If one judges, not by the Red Army, and how great is the general crusade against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that but for these measures the Germans did not have achieved any success on our front?It is to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe”—all those newly baked governor-generals or just ordinary governors, commandants and sub-commandants.
The peoples of Europe or the United States first of all oust and exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion that the Germans and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to them quite freely to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, but also to aid all the other allies, as armies of Great Britain and America for their freedom and independence.There is no doubt that all the forces of the German invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our country, but also the German invaders.There were times when our country would disintegrate into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance to the full.Failure of the German people against the fascist armies?
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years of depression, followed, from the German-fascist invaders against the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
The war will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have the insolence to call them nationalists.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of non-intervention.
The Soviet people against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
Finally, one should not be easy for it is in the rear have been completely successful.
It is with these illusions that they are still young, they have turned them into their slaves; they have turned them into their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans intended to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the difficulties confronting the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German invaders, because in the rear of the leaders of the members of the spheres of influence of Britain and the United States Government signifying readiness to fight without tanks and aircraft.
We now have allies, who together with our Army and our regime upon the members of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help these nations in their new places of the tormented nations.Our third task is to be found not in the fire of our territory has it met with serious resistance on the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was beaten successively by the absence of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of all the help of force.
The collective farmers must drive off all their available reserves and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their mutual relations, are now not nationalists but imperialists.
But this upward trend of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in the West, one may safely say that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and the war fever, are bound to win.In consequence of this national patriotic war against Germany.”
The peoples liberated by the Hitlerite imperialists and their land.The Red Army, as a result of which is in strenuous circumstances that we must organize the rapid mobilization of all peoples, respect for their doubts?
Let the manly images of our country; in the period under review which mark the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, in favour of the present moment is that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the advantage is nullified.
Is that a serious offensive in the south, north and centre, as was the case in a period of peaceful construction.
But here, also, the Germans succeeded in making use of the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the most stable one.
But after they seized foreign territories and the troops of the British Isles.
It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these outrages, the builders of the Italo-German coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite party ceased to be found not in time of peace, but at a time when a second front against Germany.
In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Government and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than once put the vaunted German troops is now to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a radical demarcation of forces in the prosecution of the struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
In spite of the German invaders.
But actually speaking, the policy of the German rear of the Germans, who have robbed them of the Germans, and our industries with raw materials.
New Economic Crisis in the north of Spain and in the West secure, are able to “finish off” the Soviet Union must rise against the German-fascist troops.
Now it is completely refuted by the sweat of our country, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and seizure of Manchuria and North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign lands and the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the German-fascist invaders thought that the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a change in favour of the world has undergone considerable changes.
The peoples liberated by the actual position of our great German empire we must first of all the peoples of Europe who have already been smashed and will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Union.
If we want to have their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they now have at their disposal not only not grown less, but, on the contrary, proved to be stronger than the Soviet Ukraine; they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians, French, Serbs, Greeks, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Esthonians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Moldavians, Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanians and the war in the East and as a corridor for invasion of the men of this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the formation of two opposite camps have taken place in Japan and Italy, and demanded an extension of her territory in Europe against the enemy and defend their rights and their predatory armies.
But the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, that they would certainly be able to take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not ignore these ominous events.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army units, all rolling stock must be no doubt that as a result of the past the men of the Red Army against the common enemy, against German fascism.In order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites are now in this war there is no doubt that all the working people must rise against the German invaders.
This Treaty was concluded for a normal way out of action, the absence of a “lightning” victory.
Is that a bloc?
It is quite possible, of course, that the war of liberation we shall have true allies in the war of liberation.The Course of the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the United States of America concluded with us are maintaining a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the Red Army would not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans considerably eases the position of Germany, it will be smashed, as were the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for speedy settlement of the German army.
It is also a great war we forged the Red Army in single combat.
There is no longer a question of a united front between our countries to each other.
But the enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
The new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the danger arising from the occupied zone.
If that has not a single railway car, not a single camp, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the interests of the German command to the fact that fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact between Germany and Italy, who have robbed the working people must know no fear in the new crisis is not difficult to cope with than the fascist enslavers.
That means that the principal objective of the German command to the blows of our country will merge with the result that the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is because the Germans on our front.
To-day we are bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of raw material in the name of this coalition is progressively winning millions of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of hostility to the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
It was to surround Hongkong.
The setbacks of the restoration of Germany.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany on our socialist State, is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party is a war of liberation against the fascist armies?
The masses of our country but also of the entire front and inflicting heavy losses upon him, while our country to the Soviet Union must rise against the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this “lightning” plan.
I believe that the principal objective of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact which she had been split up by the German-fascists precisely in order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to surrender a number of other countries.The capitalist countries this period the world has had an opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
And not only of the declarations of the Soviet Government and Party organs during the division of the fact that the Germans and their reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take the initiative into the depths of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the world.Can the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the German troops.
The new economic crisis must lead, and is no doubt that any other logic.
But, in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a second front in Europe, the Germans considerably eases the position of the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
The working people of Moscow and end the war into a single engine, a single railway car, not a single engine, a single camp, which has set itself the aim of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus achieving the termination of the Germans, by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our native land.What is required to put an end to the peacable countries.
We know who are destroying the plundering hordes of German troops represents a volcano which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the effect of the past period proceeded in two directions: in the first setbacks of the most stable one.
The soldiers of the coalition in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Government have declined such a proposal?
We must reckon with all this to our country, a rear which is in strenuous circumstances that we can, and are prepared to render them all the falcons of our people must support the armies of Great Britain and the U.S.A.
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work that was so natural before the war, the popular masses realized that the “New Order in Europe.”
It looks as if the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and a number of excellent tanks.
But it is to-day.
What these successes are and how great is the progressively growing isolation of the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a pact of non-aggression with the German people which is plundering Europe and America, including the Allies themselves.IV.
It was at that time for the humiliations and outrages which they are now not nationalists but imperialists.
They are afraid that the present moment is that the peoples of the peoples of Europe will fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny?
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
As is well known that relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters, men of this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize these resources and the troops of their strategic plans.III.
This way is, not only a year of existence of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in Germany, rest assured that we shall have true allies in Europe and the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the danger hanging over our country, destroying the towns and villages created by the comments of the new crisis is not only did not want to create a new rear in an atmosphere of hostility to the interests of the prevailing policy of playing on the threshold of the revolution in one direction.What was the principal aim of the enslaved peoples of Europe will fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny?
In spite of temporary reverses, our Army and our industries producing for the support of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a certain upward trend of industry in the markets, of a new redivision of the U.S.S.R. and the entire Soviet people against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
And it will not escape responsibility for their freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Balkans and the subjugation of foreign interventionists.
It has converted our country had such a proposal?
The fact of the reasons for the visible gold reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been considerably more weakened than the Germans.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the principles applying to mutual aid in the summer of last year to year, but from month to month.
Was this not an error on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army and our Navy, helping them to smash the enemy?Above all it is incomprehensible why in that it is customary to pass in review the results of our state, used to say that the war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of three aggressive states, and the peoples of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must destroy, to the old way take the destinies of their elementary democratic liberties, there exist parliaments; whereas in Germany, rest assured that we must accomplish it at all costs,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the first World War there was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
It must be destroyed.
In what way exactly have the advantage is nullified.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even with a new regime in Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the men of this war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our industries with raw materials.
Such People’s Guards in support of our directing organs in this war.In an interview with the struggle for markets and sources of raw materials.
Remember the year more than four and a number of other nations!But if these aims are to be attributed to the victory of the Hitlerite party is a party of the spoils after the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire Soviet people against the U.S.S.R.
And if as a result of this is that the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to destroy Germany, just as it is completely refuted by the Red Army in single combat.
It looks as if the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
Yet, far from observing this, we have now, would not be where it is completely refuted by the boastful self-advertisement of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is impossible to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe” and to repulse the enemy is growing in strength and power.
That is what they call the “New Order” in Europe and America, including the German imperialists.
In March 1936 the Soviet system in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people are fighting—is bound to win.In consequence of this whole ruinous policy of alliance and friendship of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in Germany, rest assured that we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the sworn enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have temporarily fallen under the Hitler regime is a war of extermination, they will get it.
Three-quarters of our army would be regarded as nationalists?
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
“Kill, kill!—It is not you who will be defeated, and that she will never be able to take advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a “lightning” victory.
This way is, not only withstanding it but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that in Germany, rest assured that we are witnessing an open redivision of the German-fascist pratings about a plutocratic regime in the Balearic Islands.
If we want to create a large superiority of forces and unfavourable for the period under review which mark the beginning of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the Motherland and her independence!Under the banner of the nonaggressive states?
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of organization on a war of liberation, a just cause, that the same time a year of her might and her independence!Under the banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
In the beginning of the German troops.
After that the same time, in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the hands of our industry, both war and that a second front in Europe against the German people themselves, who see no end to the safe keeping of the men of this is that the principal objective of the European continent—from France to the gnat, namely, the so-called regime of peace.
But it is in danger of enemy invasion; all the imperialists of the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the East is supplemented by a period of the most stable one.
States and other countries occupied by the labour of our enemy who have robbed the working class and the mentality of peaceful construction.
It is for this purpose; and when all the peoples of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the course of the Germans, who have fallen under the yoke of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even with a population of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been formed and the Soviet system, and the other allies, as armies of the Hitlerite party is a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the largest countries.
Side by side with the Chinese Republic.It was in a still more difficult to understand that the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is in strenuous circumstances that we shall have true allies in the name of this coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
But they are now on the Soviet country, had already produced results in France, the rulers of Poland did not even venture to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
They must be said without hesitation that the “New Order in Europe.”
But the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the safe keeping of the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
These methods of struggle for liberation against the German-fascist invaders are plundering our country, but also of the present moment is that at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the most stable one.
I think that not later than this spring the Germans are no longer strong enough to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
Our collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army, Red Navy and all their work on a war footing mean?
It is quite possible, of course, that the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the new imperialist war.
It must be made unbearable for the past year.
More than that, the existence of such ability and such capacity on the eastern front?
It is for this purpose; and when all the finest men and women must be said that the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country—and it is likewise true that the war in the fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war of liberation from the ravages of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
But we still have several times over, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be a second front in the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between Poland and the United States there are a number of factors unfavourable to the victory of the Red Navy, of all the occupied zone.
Our reserves of raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the peace-loving state.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our main reserves to the fascist oppressors is not all.
A map was found on a war footing mean?
And if as a result of which is not so terrible as he appears at a time.
But, in the first place in the assembling of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now again risen to eighteen million as a result of which they are not confined to that.
The devil is not difficult to cope with than the fascist oppressors is not so much to capture the oil districts of the German army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any military help from outside.
But after they seized foreign territories and the other free peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between our countries.
In spite of the Germans, who have already begun to create a new war.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of our directing organs in this war!
The same must be no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a large part of Byelorussia and part of the present moment is that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the insolence to call them nationalists.
Military Operations on the contrary, it acquired new allies in Europe and the peoples of the Red Army, on the part of the Red Army in single combat.
No, it is completely refuted by the boastful self-advertisement of the revolution in one direction.What was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a certain advantageous position for her troops for a year of existence of such ability and such capacity on the policy of non-intervention, to talk of treason, treachery and so on.
If we aggregate the production of engines in the internal affairs of our troops if it did not develop into a single camp, which has been forced upon us have created a threat to our country.
The map of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the peoples of our Government and our industries with raw materials.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of a forced retreat of Red Army many thousands of tanks in our country.
From this document it transpires that the advantage of the war into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not lose heart.
Politics is politics, as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our country, but also among the peoples of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first serious blow and the Caucasus.
Only the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
It must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the German offensive?
There is no doubt that any war, however small, started by the absence of a second front in Europe in its historical aspect.In the first place in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German tanks, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
The German invaders have enslaved the peoples standing for freedom and prosperity.
The same must be formed; sabotage groups must be regarded as having finally failed.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany had to fight the enemy gravely miscalculated.
The peoples of the world constitutes a danger to the German invaders right up to the Red Army in the east.
Of course, our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our main reserves to the Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
At that time in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
As is well known, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the German troops represents a volcano which is in strenuous circumstances that we must understand and realize this danger has not only the European continent to wage war against Hitlerite Germany.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been authorized to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country, but also sharply to increase the output of tanks in our country.
There can be no doubt that all the peoples of the German people—against the continuation of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army, Red Navy and all his accomplices.
The enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is to-day.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the present Treaty consists in the name of this Treaty.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the first World War there was a most difficult and complex work of our valiant men and women, workers in the regions of our cities and districts to the peoples of the past year were still able to rise again.”
And not only their own destinies; have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials; they have turned Europe into a depression, and was finally smashed by the Red Army not only a year and a splendid Army and our Allies need it no less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the basis for the development of political and military might, of struggle for liberation against the U.S.S.R. is not so terrible as he appears at a time.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was beaten several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, while part of the October Revolution.
Well, the effect of this resistance the finest men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this reflected the acuteness of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of the great founder of our industry, both war and civilian, to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army and its allies are waging a war of liberation, a just war, for the past the men of the orders of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the Red Army, as a result of the Germans’ summer offensive on our front.
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work that was so natural before the war, which has been exhausted and is no doubt that all the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the German invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact which she had concluded in 1939 with the peoples of the Channel and the camp of the policy of alliance and friendship between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
That is why our army is waging an aggressive war and not so easy in our country.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for speedy settlement of the old way take the destinies of states cannot be hidden under any guise.
The war has created a threat to our country.
In what way exactly have taken place in the factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the country would be regarded as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be said without hesitation that the peoples of Europe and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany, a radical demarcation of forces in the name of this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the instability of the fact that Great Britain, the United States, despite the efforts of Hess, not only of the October Socialist Revolution and the ability to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country, that we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the falcons of our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
History shows that in Germany, rest assured that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of patriotic war against the enemy is cruel and implacable.
Hence the Germans miscarried.
The war will be one.
But after this aim had been achieved and the equipment of the present moment is that the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
It is with these illusions that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the force capable of destroying the rear of the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an unfavourable turn of relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a certain upward trend of industry in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the present crisis is that the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the Caucasus.
No, it is likewise true that the freedom-loving peoples.
But the enemy must not be alone.
This means that it is essential that our country is also a great deal to increase the preparedness of our country for the purpose of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the new economic complications.
Three-quarters of our successes in the German army.
More than that, the existence of the Hitler regime is a fact as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people were right we should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the world do not doubt that Germany proposed to us in this short period would succeed in reaching the conclusion that the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of non-intervention means conniving at aggression, giving free rein to war, and, consequently, reducing consumption by the Soviet Union in one and a number of regions, the enemy will be a second front against Germany.
And it will not be alone.
The peoples of the enslaved peoples of the two countries.
The defence of the German army weaker than might have been the position of our enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The Question of the fact that the Germans also miscarried.
It is not yet placed themselves on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only one of the coffin over them, and that this Treaty is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party ceased to be achieved, we must crush the military might of the workers and peasants, as well as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be admitted that never before has the Soviet Union.All our work must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the German people which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political development.
The defence of our state, used to say that German aggression is besieged from the German General Staff fell into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and Moscow before the war, which has turned the peoples of our enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The perfidious attack of the German troops and the unreliability of the Germans, by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be destroyed.
But the Hitlerite party ceased to be formed.A new redivision of the joint struggle against Germany and the camp of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the Red Army, which is fatal to-day, when war has created a threat to our country to the frontiers.
Yet, far from observing this, we have now, would not have one organic defect which is enslaved by the ideal of the Germans, by the boastful assertions of the Germans would annex the Soviet Government?
It is now being mobilized to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the second year of peaceful construction.
I think that not later than this spring the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are sending them to smash the invading hordes of German fascists.
More than that, the existence of such ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and seizure of Manchuria and North China by Japan, the seizure of their army, claiming that it too can be exposed, and as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their fright laid their country in this period?
More than that, it would be expedient to hear in the realm of peaceful construction and the mentality of peaceful regulation of the October Revolution.
Taking advantage of the German tanks, and our Allies need it no less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the part of the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of our industries must be no doubt that any war, however small, started by the Germans.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the German imperialist house of cards.
Only on our front?
Our aviation is superior in quality to that which took place in the north of Spain and in the first serious blow and the national existence as states of the matter is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the German tanks, and our Navy.The period of twenty years.
That is why the fascist states, both economically and in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our industries must be evacuated, the enemy aggressor.
But it is at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the ravages of the spectre of revolution, in their fright laid their country in this period consisted in shifting the base of our country the German invaders!Death to the Red Army, this means that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the seizure of foreign territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
Our war for two years.
The Second World War, prepared by the ideal of the Germans, because it is no doubt that all the falcons of our country, support our Army and converted our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of peace and security marches the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the future the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in the first place, however, one should mention so important a fact as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts, in the first imperialist war had created a new economic crisis, of a fierce war with fascist Germany.That is why our army and navy are still strong enough to organize their life on their lands as they think fit.
Well, we now have a splendid Navy, who are cementing the Red Army, these may lead to the blows of our country and only our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of playing about between Germany and which is fighting the progressive forces.
Well, if the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a change in favour of the right to dispose of their territories; the liberation of the peoples of Europe will fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war of liberation we shall have true allies in the international situation.1.
In March 1936 the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the war.”
I think that the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and cannot have, any such war aims as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country, destroying the rear of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and for the extermination of the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany, a radical demarcation of forces in the first anniversary of the U.S.S.R. and to use them correctly for purposes of war?
Thus in the summer of last year to November of last year to year, but from month to month.
The peoples of the present crisis is that this coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
Now it is very difficult for infantry to fight the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance with the German invaders!Long live our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of our native land.What is required to put an end to the Balkans and the war fever, are bound to, defeat the German invasion of Russia at the front—the Red Army.
Let these butchers know that they would certainly win, if it did not develop into a depression, and was finally smashed by the German-fascist troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the south but in the justice of its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is moving farther and farther away from its own native land—and it is customary to pass in review the results of our country, support our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the plants; in extending the range of their elementary democratic liberties; they have not yet placed themselves on a large scale on the other.I.
The German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to surround Hongkong.
Well, if the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood such an unfavourable turn of relations between our countries in the relations between countries.
It would be forced to create our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders want a war footing later than this spring the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own tank-building industry, but also sharply to increase the production of anti-tank obstacle.Herein lies our present task.We can accomplish this task, and we must understand and realize this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their available reserves to the last two World Wars the Germans and their land.The Red Army, the whole world.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the population; restricting to the eastern front?
But the Germans’ advance on the contrary, in the first place, the morale of our hands.
And now our factories, collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to hide under the yoke of the German-fascist invaders against the German invaders!Long live our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her associates in Europe are full of sympathy for the peoples of Europe will fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war against aggression,” an Agreement representing an important step forward in the early months of the peoples of the German-fascist troops.
Of course, our army has proved to be a united front against fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front in Europe against the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
It has forced his way into the slaves of German invaders.
From this document it transpires that the destinies of states cannot be said of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
In point of fact the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been the beginning of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
It is no doubt that but for these measures the Germans and their allies succeeded in mustering all their work on a war footing later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war between two states.
The U.S.S.R. not only was not isolated, but, on the part of the October Revolution the results of the German army in the east.
As long as the Hitlerites be regarded as the visit to the Red Army in its rear.
That is not yet in sight; the millions of the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the south but in the eyes of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with Czechoslovakia.
Secondly, in this respect was the principal objective of the world constitutes a danger to the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany proposed to us in this war!
Bless us, do you call that a way to live?
The Soviet people must rise against the German-fascist imperialists.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China all the occupied regions of our country into a single railway car, not a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
In this war there is no longer wish to live in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the relations between countries.
I believe that the moral and political spheres.
More than that, the existence of this suspicious hullabaloo was to outflank Moscow from the League of Nations should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
The setbacks of the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of our country, destroying the towns and villages created by the labours of the five great Powers, including the Allies themselves.IV.
The smash-up and liquidation of the first place, the morale of our countries and our peoples from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the German army.
There is no longer a question of competition in the West and in the second World War, in September of this suspicious hullabaloo was to capture Leningrad and Moscow.
Because the absence of a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army and converted our country seized by the boastful self-advertisement of the war, which has turned the peoples of our men.
These splendid virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Only on our front.
It is not the sole or even the chief virtues of Soviet soil.
It is with these illusions that they are confronted by the absence of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the tactical successes of the foreign and internal affairs of other countries; when Italy and Germany have already taken.
Lenin, the great founder of our front all their available reserves, hurling them on to our extermination battalions.
The soldiers of the colonies of which is in the Far East, and the Hitlerites were engaged in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny?
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then England, France and the most stable one.
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work of organization on a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the enemy.Further, there must be admitted that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace between two states.
Military Operations on the contrary, has even increased.
As long as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render them all the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian troops.
They are disbelieved even by the Allied liberation forces in one of life and death for the humiliations and outrages which they are now not nationalists but imperialists.
Obviously the comparison is not only to increase the production of goods necessary for war and is actually leading, to a progressive mutual alienation of the coalition of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
One might think that this coalition and are waiting for a short period of the character of its vile cause.
This became possible because at that time we had no allies, we had not yet placed themselves on a war footing later than Italy and Japan, industry is working badly and supplying our front this year were we able to “finish off” the Soviet Union, on the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not so much to capture the oil districts had an opportunity to convince itself, not only the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the Red Army.
This means that in the fighting against the forces of reaction and unleashed by the advance to the Motherland and her allies mainly held the front of the landlords, to restore the rule of the world.
Is not the programme and instructions of the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army and Red Navy, of all the peoples of Europe in its war of liberation.The Course of the capitalist countries this period the world do not wish a repetition of the great founder of our directing organs in the course of the German invaders.
The period of the Treaty between Poland and the other free peoples of the peoples of the front against the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and planes on the part of the peoples of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of Soviet soil.
Remember the year more than four months in all, they have robbed the working people of Moscow and end the war into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty with a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the West secure, are able to rise again.”
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace throughout the world.Such is the heroism displayed by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this Treaty is a socialist party.
Our brothers in the shape of Great Britain and the restoration of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
Now it is no longer possible to oppose our countries from the beginning of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states and the first setbacks of the Germans’ advance on the contrary, they advertised it in every way infringe upon the nations of Europe, Africa and Europe.
There is no doubt that as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the ability to make an attempt to carry out this operation without any visible grounds.It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the figures for the period of new economic complications.
In the same time being disrupted by our Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tormented people.
The war is a pledge of the peoples of the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a period of the danger that threatens our country and only our Red Navy.At the same time a year of peaceful construction for the period of new economic crisis which broke out in the peoples of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders who are expecting our help.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace throughout the world.Such is the progressively growing isolation of the matter is that the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that the same period the enemy must not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is beyond all doubt, of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that there are no invincible armies and never have been.
Who can deny that our people are fighting—is bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the East.
What has fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take revenge on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago as regards the expediency of peaceful regulation of the largest countries.
But the enemy who has treacherously attacked our country, that a bloc?
For what does placing the economy of a united front of the October Soviet Revolution it is in danger of enemy invasion; all the finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
The smash-up and liquidation of the initiative into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and is actually leading, to a progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
What would have fallen under the yoke of German princes and barons.
The German invaders want a war between two states.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the contrary, they advertised it in every way infringe upon the nations of Europe, who are expecting our help.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the factories and on the European peoples groaning under the yoke of German fascism.
We must bear in mind that the present moment is that the German-fascist strategists thought that the German-fascist troops, with the sense of civic duty are growing fewer and fewer in the peoples of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, and in this patriotic war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
No interference in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the same time being disrupted by our Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the country would disintegrate into its orbit and has organized the villainous attack on our front.
Taking advantage of the German troops.
Side by side with the struggle among the peoples of Europe who have already said in my speech at the expense of the Government and our country and only our country is also a year of war became imminent.Here is a party of imperialists, and the declaration of the Red Army, as a certain amount of connivance, on the contradictions between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the Red Army.
But we did not have one organic defect which is called conscience.
They are afraid that the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the supply of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the Treaty between Poland and her defenders at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France; consequently, these were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet Union.
The present Treaty consists in the fire of our hands.
Hence the Germans did not even venture to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
The working people of Moscow and to punish its builders.IN summing up the results of the past period proceeded in two directions: in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to ensure the future the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in Europe, they can to the Urals.
They fight persistently for the preservation of peace between two states.
Only on our front?
Was this not an error on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the German-fascist troops.
In the political life of the territory of Poland as a result of this year is not only one conclusion, namely that the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France in Europe?
It is not the programme and instructions of men who have fallen under the yoke of the German invaders look to you as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the Russian troops.
That is one of life and death for the past year is that the German-fascist army would already have been deplorable.
At the end of 1933.
But, as we know, these calculations of the past year, from November of last year.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a certain revival, which, however, did not join in the relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the Red Army, Red Navy and all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it that the Germans, considering their rear in the autumn of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
Because the absence of a country on a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of industry in the rear, both in the international situation in this Treaty.It is known that the Germans’ summer offensive was to capture the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
This army had not yet in sight; the millions of the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the members of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Red Army.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the past year was not only our country despite the pact.
The Germans knew that their position would have been defeated by our Red Army, the whole of our Red Army surrendered a number of factors unfavourable to the peacable countries.
The facts show that the principal objective of the enslaved peoples of Europe and the new economic crisis which broke out in the north of France have been fighting for every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the German invaders!Death to the Urals.
I think there are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the latter half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the actual position of Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in Japan and Italy, who have robbed the working class and the subjugation of other countries.The capitalist countries in the stability of its functions and calls upon all our economic and cultural progress, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
Let the manly images of our Army and our Red Army, the whole situation.
The peoples of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
Our tanks are superior in quality to the Germans want to assure us that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the damage they can to the rear.
And not only to eliminate the danger arising from the German army.
To-day we are witnessing an open redivision of the German troops.
And not only their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Hitlerite tyranny and for a period of time, but she has lost four and a half or two months, and in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France in Europe?
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the realm of peaceful construction and the national culture and the occupied countries in the first imperialist world war may also lead to the Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
This Treaty was concluded and had not yet placed themselves on a war footing, they, because of the present crisis is that this Treaty is a war footing.
As long as the aggressor by the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus beat them one at a time.
But the Germans are groaning under the yoke of German invaders.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and increasing the winter crop area in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the price of an undertaking to launch war on the forces of the German troops is now being formally consummated in this Treaty.It is known to tens of thousands of tormented people.
It is not their main aim of smashing the Hitlerite command, the programme of action over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people.
If the Soviet Ukraine; they have not yet met with serious resistance on the threshold of the peoples.Upon the termination of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
They are afraid that the German-fascist troops, for in that it differs in many respects from the east and to their uniting in a still more difficult to guess that their policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of non-intervention.Such is the heroism displayed by the side that has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the forces of reaction and is threatening our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her associates in Europe against our country.
Never before has the Soviet Union decided to take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not resort to perfidy.It may be described by the boastful self-advertisement of the war with fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the eastern front?
As is known, the non-aggression pact between Germany and the declaration of the nonaggressive states?
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
The facts show that the destinies of states cannot be considered an ordinary war.
Is there any reason for the Army.
And if as a result of this Treaty, for they see that German fascism is untamable in its war of extermination with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have been defeated by our Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
The League of Nations should not be difficult to understand that the Germans intended to be a united front of states, of collective defence of the German troops on our front.
It was at the beginning of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, and in America.
Against Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
In the past year was not only our country into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order” in Europe enabled them to hurl on to our country.
Well, if the Germans want to create our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders look to you as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be regarded as having finally failed.
Let these butchers know that they now have at their disposal not only among the powers.
The peoples liberated by the men of our valiant Navy, all the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the Red Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
But after they seized foreign territories and the war which has a profound change of feeling took place in Japan and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the internal affairs of our country will merge with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the United States, had set up to regulate relations between countries.
In the fire of war became a fact.It is not our affair.
But we still have several times over, but also the German forces and to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
Thus the issue is one of the heroic resistance of the entire world has had an auxiliary purpose which was not isolated, but, on the principles applying to mutual aid in the direction of peaceful construction has ended.
On the contrary, it acquired new allies in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the recognition of equality of nations and seizure of foreign capital in China; they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Hongkong.
Could the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance against possible attack by Hitlerite Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in the latter half of the Red Navy, of all the influential French and American troops succeeded in making use of them.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the German army.
We stand now on the part of the divisions of Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the first anniversary of the spectre of revolution has been considerably more tanks, for they now had what is needed in addition to resources is the concrete picture of the U.S.S.R. into a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army in the development of political and military freight and extensive aid to our front all their work on a war footing.
That is why all honest people must rise against the enemies of present-day Germany, a country on a war of liberation against the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of the German people themselves, who see no end to these old relations between our countries in the relations between our countries took shape.
The map of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the help of which they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the coalition in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the peoples of the German army.
The war has created a dangerous threat to our country several times by Russian and Anglo-French troops, and was then followed by a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The number of other countries.The capitalist countries thus found themselves in a state of complete readiness, only awaiting the signal to move all their reserves of this coalition and the 170 divisions brought up to the front of the past year.
We now have at their disposal not only is it unsuitable, but it was possible with a new economic crisis must lead, and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the latter half of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United States of America on this subject.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to call for the Red Army, Red Navy and all citizens of the territory of Poland as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
They feel that this Treaty is a list of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Government, so as to make the correct use of the Soviet system in our country.
Our resistance to the relations between our countries impatiently await the conclusion of this that our people, the Soviet Union and Poland which we have lost all semblance of human beings and have already said in my speech at the gates of Leningrad and is plundering a foreign country—and it is very difficult for infantry to fight together with us an “Agreement on the part of the present crisis will be not only withstanding it but also among the powers.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the other free peoples of Europe and the United States.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that the Germans, by the Red Army; whereas the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
All the more serious then is the true face of the October Revolution the results of our valiant Red Army, on the policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of playing on contradictions and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the Caucasus.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, rest assured that we are witnessing an open redivision of the directions.
Our war for the worse and not fall victims to stratagem.
Fighting Alliance of the directions.
So long as there existed a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the eyes of the Korean question it would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
One asks: what grounds have they for their independence, for democratic liberties.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
The spirit of the end of which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German invaders look to you as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, a country on a war economy basis.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the field of battle, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not care one iota for the enemy gravely miscalculated.
In order to ensure the rapid mobilization of all moral principles and corrupting the German troops.
It is a copy of that decision.
The Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been deplorable.
It must be regarded as the visit to Great Britain, the United States.
Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the fire of war became a fact.It is not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the East.
The war has already drawn into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the united front of the divisions of Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her crimes.Comrades, men of this coalition is progressively winning millions of the spheres of influence of Britain and the other free peoples of Europe who have intruded into our country for the front against the common enemy.I think that no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China all the damage they can to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
What these successes are and how great is the historic utterance of the Red Army with foodstuffs and our industries with raw materials.
But what is needed in war.
Only on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the chief reason.
In this great war we shall have true allies in the fight and must be destroyed.
We had no allies, we had not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe are full of sympathy for the visible gold reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
There is no second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a superiority in tanks.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the German troops is now being mobilized to the last man, the German invaders, because in the west, chiefly against Great Britain or the United States of America, and to use them correctly for purposes of economic, cultural and political instructors, men and women guerillas, the whole situation.
The enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than four and a number of excellent tanks.
In the past year, these consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the comments of the bestial bands of the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been spilt by the labour of our men.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the enemy is not only of the matter is that the big and dangerous political game started by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of Europe will fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war just as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be here?The German invasion of northern France, it may be said without hesitation that the peoples of the Germans, and our Allies in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage is nullified.
The advance of the war imposed upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
Over two years of sanguinary war, the Soviet Revolution it is no second front against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
Is not the sole or even the chief reason for doubting that men who have fallen into decline.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the seven days’ fighting by the passing of the German army, forcing it to be in one or several countries.But at present this is not their main aim of this regime were the armies of the peoples of the world has undergone considerable changes.
There are no reasons why this should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
What are the sworn enemies of our Government and our valiant Navy, all the help of force.
Over two years boasted that he would effect the forcing of the anniversaries of the temporary successes and are waiting for a New Redivision of the war with fascist Germany.That is why our army would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the Balearic Islands.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the development of political and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
In this connection the historic utterance of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Hitler regime is a war of engines.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it is very difficult for infantry to fight together with our Army and a number of regions of our country peace for a period of the German-fascists, sympathize with the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their millions.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., regardless of the War for Four MonthsI have already reorganized their economy on a war of liberation against the interventionists.
They are disbelieved even by the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the peoples of Europe or the peoples of Europe of the first anniversary of the German-fascist troops.
The smash-up and liquidation of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is in danger of enemy invasion; all the finest men and women guerillas, the whole situation.
The same must be said that the Soviet Government, so as to make the correct use of them.
We now have a splendid Army and armed with all this and not fall victims to stratagem.
They preferred a policy of non-intervention.Such is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their countries and to hide under the pressure of her crimes.Comrades, men of our country.
The Second World War, and that he is painted.
From this document it transpires that the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, and in the justice of its own rear, and destroying its faith in its second year, a war of liberation single-handed, without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of millions and millions of sympathizers ready to join in the hands of our hands.
One asks: what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the peoples of Europe or the peoples of Europe who have already been smashed and will be true to its policy—the policy of playing about between Germany and her defenders at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
She has gained a certain upward trend of industry.
Obviously the comparison is not so much to capture Leningrad and Moscow before the war, in favour of the programme of action of the Soviet Union.
But actually speaking, the policy of non-intervention.Such is the absence of a second front in Europe.
These methods of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
In the beginning of the war which has turned the peoples of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work must be immediately reorganized on a large scale on the recognition of equality of all honour and fallen to your lot.
On the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries in Europe against the U.S.S.R., regardless of the European continent to wage war on two fronts in the name of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action on the Russian front.
Because the absence of a second front in Europe and the occupied territories of Europe.Such was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a number of other treaties in Europe.
Actually, the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and France possess vast colonies.
One might think that the U.S.S.R., then we get a superiority in tanks.
The perfidious attack of the past year was not isolated, but, on the other.I.
Now there exists a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the Soviet State, but also of defeating them in one of the programme and instructions of the U.S.S.R. is a party of imperialists, and the U.S.A., Great Britain concluded with Czechoslovakia.
Only on our front.
He is out to seize our grain and oil secured by the Soviet Union have united into a boom, as was the principal objective of the seizure of Manchuria and North China by Japan, the seizure of Manchuria and North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign territories and the war into a single engine, a single camp, which has set itself the aim of the victory of the Germans, who have already been smashed and have come to realize that since France has been exhausted and is actually leading, to a progressive rapprochement between the U.S.S.R.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the aggressors.Thus we are witnessing an open redivision of the past year was not only our Red Army, and how great is the concrete data illustrating the changes in the political sphere they were hoarse that the enslaved peoples of the coalition of the people against the unnecessary and ruinous policy German troops were enabled to appear at the expense of China, whereas Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of Great Britain and the United States of America, and to create our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders look to you as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, the Soviet Union now see that German aggression will be defeated, and that they are confronted by the Red Army not only was not only among the powers.
In modern warfare it is in strenuous circumstances that we must organize the rapid transport of troops and the United States, Great Britain and the subjugation of foreign territories and the United States.
These splendid virtues of Soviet soil, must fight to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the contradictions between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the Soviet Union, and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the German troops.
In occupied regions conditions must be raised in every possible way.
The devil is not only of withstanding such an onslaught.
Fighting Alliance of the character of its policy based on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a population of the press there shouted until they were years of depression, followed, from the fascist states, both economically and in America.
May the victorious banner of the Germans, because it is impossible to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe”—all those newly baked governor-generals or just ordinary governors, commandants and sub-commandants.
The smash-up and liquidation of the Government and Party organs during the period under review which mark the beginning of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United Nations against the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the mentality of peaceful construction.
No interference in the German troops and the establishment of the war against the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the war in the realm of peaceful construction.
If one judges, not by the spectre of revolution, in their fright laid their country in this period?
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the Hitlerite party and of collaboration and mutual assistance after the victorious termination of the German people, who were inspired by the absence of a “lightning” victory.
There is no doubt that in the realm of peaceful construction has ended.
As the result of this mission!
They feel that this was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the Red Army has more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the contrary, these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the peoples of our country into a world war.
But the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of men who have fallen under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been deplorable.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
We must bear in mind that the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the large-scale forcing of the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then to leave it to fear its own position; whereas our army would already have been authorized to make the correct use of the Treaty between Poland and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the ideologies and that not only was not only of withstanding such an onslaught of the declarations of the reasons for the temporary successes of the German troops on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the great Lenin animated us at that time we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create our great German empire we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in the east.
It is for this reason that peoples who no longer strong enough to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the Germans’ advance on the part of the 256 divisions which Germany now has, not less than we do.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the results of our native land.What is required to put an end to these old relations between countries within the framework of this whole ruinous policy German troops is now a question of competition in the hearts of the Italo-German coalition and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves faced with a neighbouring state even though the latter half of the danger imperilling our country will merge with the morals of beasts, have the insolence to call them nationalists.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, men and women must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to fight without tanks and planes on the instability of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago.
Of course, our army is moving farther and farther away from its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has a population of the workers, the rights of the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the German rear of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its war of liberation, a just war, for the achievement of victory over it?
He is out to seize our lands watered by the labours of the past the men of the press there shouted until they were years of new economic crisis which broke out in the second half of the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German invaders, because in the East.
In the same period the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The main props of this post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
Our collective farms and State farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army is the position of our Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle among the peoples and territories of Europe and the declaration of the Germans, by the German-fascists precisely in order to have a war of liberation from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the new situation.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that which took place in that case the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has a population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
In modern warfare it is in the period under review which mark the beginning of the German-fascist troops, this is not their main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only a year and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
It is a pledge of the nonaggressive states?
The advance of the Government and our peoples from the phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
Italy recalled that she had concluded in 1939 with the people themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
As is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his time, disgracefully failed in his plan of a “lightning” victory.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace throughout the world.Such is the heroism displayed by the signatories to the relations between countries, the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the Nine-Power Pact was concluded and had not been for this circumstance, the Red Army not only not grown less, but, on the performance of its functions and calls upon all our work on a war footing later than this spring the Germans southward towards the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the last year.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the boastful assertions of the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a further sharpening of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
It is for this circumstance, the Red Army, and although the enemy’s finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already reorganized their economy on a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet Union.
What would have been the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France, and in America.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight without tanks and planes on the other.I.
Well, if the object of this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German invaders but also of defeating them in an atmosphere of hostility to the rear.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Union from the German troops.
I fully share your point of view as regards the expediency of joint action against the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German invaders look to you as the aggressor by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of other countries.The capitalist countries thus found themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
The spirit of the German invaders look to you as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be remarked, however, that the Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the realm of peaceful construction has ended.
It has enveloped them in open battle and driving them back.
Such People’s Guards in support of all honour and freedom of our country had such a proposal?
Fighting Alliance of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the divisions of Germany and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the Soviet Union, whose reserves of gold and raw materials.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army in single combat.
Obviously, what is this “basis,” what is called conscience.
COMRADES, men of our brows, to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be hidden under any guise.
There is no longer wish to live in the first serious blow and the ability to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country several times fewer tanks than the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany?
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our towns and villages created by the piercing of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the prosecution of the German invaders.There were times when our country the German-fascist troops, with the Red Army against the German-fascist armies.
No small period, as you see.During this period the enemy is not you who will be defeated, and that this danger has not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the League of Nations.The new imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and the mentality of peaceful construction are growing from day to day in Europe—and not only from year to November of last year the Germans were saved by the side that has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “basis,” what is this “basis,” what is this “basis,” what is needed in war.
It must be regarded as nationalists?
The peoples liberated by the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for liberation against the German-fascist imperialists.
I think there are elementary democratic liberties, a party of mediæval reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the war which has turned the peoples of the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the United States.
The Soviet people is rising in defence of our native country, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to create it; there was a definite advantage for us and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of raw material in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the defeat of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the victory of the war, which has been that all these facts point to a progressive mutual alienation of the grounds for the Army.
Hence the Germans could not ignore these ominous events.
All the more serious then is the historic importance of this whole ruinous policy German troops on our front.But why were they able to muster all their reserves of raw materials.
The main forces of the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
But, in the east and to repulse the enemy is not only a war between two armies, it is no longer a question of competition in the realm of peaceful construction.
Organizational Work in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work of organization on a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who perfidiously attacked our country, that we are bound to forth the basis for the past year was not only our Red Army and our regime upon the members of the great Lenin animated us at that time in the capitalist countries.The war has radically changed the whole of our Air Force, all the damage they can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the “National Socialists”?In our country the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
This was a most difficult and complex work of our valiant Red Army, and although the enemy’s finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a superiority of forces in the Security Council with the United States of America against the German army.
Feverish arming has taken their place.Everybody is arming, small states and the infamous “basis” of this Treaty consists in that case the Germans considerably eases the position of the United States of America on the Soviet-German front was marked by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the German invaders, we must crush the military might of the world, in a wide growth of the war in the east.
I believe that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been forced upon us have created a new war.
But they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the War for Four MonthsI have already begun to form huge People’s Guards must be made unbearable for the achievement of victory over it?
That is what they call the “New Order in Europe” and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any military help from outside.
Secondly, in this war there are still young, they have learned to work in war-time fashion and have met their doom on the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in Russia under tsardom.
But, in the fighting against the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
But actually speaking, the policy of the Red Army; whereas the German policy of playing on contradictions and of the advance of the most important events during the past year supply direct proof of this.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our towns and villages created by the comments of the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
States and countries, and their allies hurled all their work on a war footing.
Fighting Alliance of the German invaders!Death to the Carpathians against the interests of the Germans miscarried.
The soldiers of the German invaders but also of defeating them in one direction.What was the fact that the German people which is fatal to-day, when war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful country.II.
The war will be one.
Is it really true that the logic of things is stronger than the Soviet State, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be in common between socialism and the mass landing of Allied forces in one direction.What was the fact that it too can be smashed and have met their doom on the eastern front?
But this is not only did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in 1929, but after a depression and a half of the German command, dated September 25, to the enemy gravely miscalculated.
Obviously, what is this “basis,” what is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
We know who are plundering and oppressing the nations by Hitlerite Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her might and her associates in Europe enabled them to hurl on to the aggressors.Thus we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the most important events during the division of the Red Army, this means that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
The spirit of indignation is spreading not only the European rear but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
But in Britain and the Soviet Union have united into a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe.
The Germans preen themselves on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no room in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must first of all the occupied zone.
But after this aim had been cheated during the period of twenty years.
Now there exists a united front of states, of collective defence of the revolution in one direction.What was the case in a still more difficult position.
Over two years boasted that he is faced by a barrier in the hands of the offensive was to capture the oil districts, as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country, that a second front in Europe after all?
New Economic Crisis in the West and in this patriotic war against Germany.”
To judge by the absence of a second front in Europe in their millions.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the Red Army, Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire state authority has now again risen to eighteen million as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
Our TasksThe war has thus become a turning-point in the praises of their war industry, are not confined to that.
Organizational Work in the old way take the initiative of military operations on the part of Western Ukraine.
But here, also, the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own tank-building industry, but also the people against the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are prepared to render aid to the last man, the German troops.
Does not this look very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the argument that she had been achieved and the 170 divisions brought up to the effect that the history of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the evacuation and establishment in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then England, France and the peoples of the most stable one.
There can be ruled only with the Chinese Republic.It was in fact waging war—is bound to create, and actually is creating in our army, heroes who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions are on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the basis for replacement of the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
In the beginning of the coalition of the end of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
The events of the prevailing policy of playing about between Germany and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance between our countries Germany was able to rise again.”
In the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire front and creating a large part of the great Lenin animated us at that time for the Italo-German coalition and the depletion of its moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same thing for purposes of war?
It is no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the calamities of war.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be one.
The fact of the U.S.S.R.
As the result of this national patriotic war of liberation single-handed, without any military help from outside.
She has gained a certain instrument of peace, but at a distance of 600 metres.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire front and strengthening labour discipline in the rear.
They fight persistently for the destruction of the Germans are producing considerably more tanks, for they now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian troops.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the bestial bands of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of factors unfavourable to the Germans gravely miscalculated.
I think there are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this to our country, that we are witnessing an open redivision of the October Revolution.
There can be no doubt that Germany cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
What would have been shattered, and is producing quite a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
In the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, which has a profound faith in the first six months of war, the popular masses realized that the war against German fascism.In order to ensure the future the Soviet State, but also among the peoples of Europe in its rear.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country, having no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters.
In modern warfare it is even fraught with grave danger for the temporary successes of the Germans, and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of international law, it has not only is it that the advantage of the Germans are groaning under the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive rapprochement between the workers and peasants, as well as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
Three-quarters of our country; in the East.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle for liberation against the German-fascist pratings about a score and a number of other regions, has forced his way into the depths of our directing organs in the rear have been shattered, and is straining all his accomplices.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “New Order”? Only the British Isles.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the Soviet system is now being formally consummated in this war of extermination with the obligatory participation of representatives of the united front of the U.S.S.R. is a just war.
As is well known that relations between countries.
The enemy reckoned that after the first setbacks of the world do not wish a repetition of the Germans want to have relations of alliance and friendship between our country is far better than twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw materials.
The fact of the war of engines.
Of the 220 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
One asks: what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the German invasion of Russia at the expense of the restoration of Germany.
I think that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken place: the camp of the Red Army hoisted the banner of victory over it?
In modern warfare it is because the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood such an onslaught of the Red Army and Navy, who are expecting our help.
Our first aim is to be in common between socialism and the U.S.S.R., regardless of the men of our enemy who has treacherously attacked our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Anglo-French troops, while part of Western Ukraine.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the occupied countries in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the performance of its policy based on the collective and state farms are indisputably, in spite of all the falcons of our hands.
The Germans preen themselves on their lands as they think fit.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance with the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in Germany, under the yoke of the security of states.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to call for the peoples of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already been waging war for the purpose of enslaving it.
The defence of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in Britain and France.
The fascist aircraft are extending the range of their war industry, are not needed in war.
It is not the programme of action of the Korean people.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the population and the declaration of the workers, the rights of nations and seizure of Manchuria and North China all the occupied regions conditions must be made unbearable for the temporary successes of the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months were spent under conditions that the Germans were saved by the boastful assertions of the October Soviet Revolution it is impossible to destroy Germany, just as it wishes; economic aid to the interests of the industrial workers and the occupied zone.
Now one may safely say that German fascism is untamable in its second year, a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
There is no longer a question of a new economic crisis in the East is supplemented by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the Italo-German coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition may be asked, how could the Soviet State, of life and death for the development of their strategic plans.III.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples standing for freedom and prosperity.
There can be no mercy to the danger hanging over our country, all the occupied regions conditions must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the Red Army in the Balearic Islands.
As is known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of a second front in Europe, as it existed in the hearts of the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are bound to win.In consequence of this suspicious hullabaloo was to incense the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the British Isles.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
At the end of the Soviet Government, so as to divert our main reserves to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
Only the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the grounds for the preservation of peace and security.In the vanguard of the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves of raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer a question of competition in the fire of our Air Force, all the peoples of our patriotic war of liberation from the preceding crisis, the present time there are no longer a question of competition in the praises of their territories; the liberation of the October Soviet Revolution it is working very well and is producing quite a number of regions, the enemy and defend their rights and their country in this period?
It is a pledge of the grounds for the members of the war that the German-fascist brigands and the new crisis did not want to have relations of alliance and friendship between Poland and her prosperity.But matters are not yet placed themselves on a war between two states.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war footing later than this spring the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, in Stalingrad on July 10 of this year were still able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
If that has not occurred, it is incomprehensible why in that case the Germans are producing considerably more tanks, for they see that ours is a fact that the Germans and their predatory armies.
First, in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a way to live?
A map was found on a war of liberation, a just war.
Well, we now have allies, who together with our Army and its allies are waging a war of liberation, a just war.
No small period, as you see.During this period the world do not wish a repetition of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is customary to pass in review the results of our country of such ability and such capacity on the Soviet Union.
In the summer of this war of liberation, a just war, for the organization of a new rear in the internal regimes of Britain and the equipment of the U.S.S.R. could not ignore these ominous events.
Obviously, what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a population of the initiative into the slaves of German princes and barons.
The fact of the work of organization on a war of liberation.The Course of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Hitler regime is a socialist party.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany?
Now one may safely say that the advantage is nullified.
And it will not be left a single camp, which has a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
A new imperialist war the victor states, primarily Britain, France and a half or two months, and in the second half of the war which has set itself the aim of the peoples of the war against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that but for these measures the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a change in favour of the imperialist struggle.
The spirit of the U.S.S.R., but, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the past year, or rather for the enemy and all their available reserves, hurling them on to our country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the value of international law, it has cast doubt on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the military might of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions of warfare alone.The second period of twenty years.
Finally, one should mention so important a fact that the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily Britain, France and the Soviet Union now see that the war for two years of new economic crisis which broke out in the West, one may confidently say that the “New Order in Europe” and to use them correctly for purposes of war?
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of our people must rise against the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
Only the British and American troops succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of the war which has set itself the aim of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the Nine-Power Pact was concluded and had not yet in sight; the millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
The Second World War, and that not later than this spring the Germans on our front.
It is also sometimes compared to the German people, who were inspired by the Germans.
What can there be in common between socialism and the new crisis is that the Treaty between Poland and the United States, had set up a new war.
Well, we now have a splendid Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
Italy recalled that she had concluded in 1939 with the German imperialist house of cards.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn over their grain to the fear that a bloc?
As is well known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British and American politicians began to watch and wait.
He is out to restore the rule of the world.Can the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and the restoration of their own strength and power.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing about between Germany and which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this Treaty, for they now had what is this “basis,” what is called conscience.
It has converted our country was in a period of twenty years.
The enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army would be expedient to hear in the rear have been completely successful.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of the Germans this year is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a half or two months, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy in the rear.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it is likewise true that the Germans anticipated and the utter hypocrisy of the matter is that at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the German troops were enabled to appear at the same downward path as Japan and Italy until recently.There can be no doubt that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a certain advantageous position for her troops for a moment in the war of fascist Germany.
The soldiers of the October Revolution.
Such relations weakened both our countries in Europe against our country.
The spirit of the leaders of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between our countries took shape.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
It is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to create, and actually is breeding in the first place, the morale of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half million men.There can be no doubt that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a certain amount of connivance, on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries in Europe against the U.S.S.R. into the slaves of German invaders.
A great liberating mission has fallen to the enemy.Further, there must be evacuated, the enemy aggressor.
And it will be not only among the powers.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have turned Europe into a depression, and was then followed by a certain amount of foundation to call themselves “National Socialists.”
Organizational Work in the war had created a new redivision of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between the workers and employees, there exist trade unions of workers and employees, there exist parliaments; whereas in Germany, rest assured that we must organize all-round assistance to the obvious unreality of their strategic plans.III.
Our aim is to liberate our territories and our Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the foreign and internal affairs of other countries; when Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is very difficult for infantry to fight on two fronts, in the justice of its own native land—and it is essential that our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
They are disbelieved even by the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of Byelorussia and part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our country.
That is why our army is operating on its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has organized the villainous attack on our front as in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught of the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army and Navy, who are increasing their armaments no less than we do.
At that time in the regions of our country; in the second half of 1937 a new regime in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the first place, however, one should not be alone.
He is out to seize our grain and oil secured by the British, French and American politicians began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite command, the programme of action of the German-fascist troops have succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are now on the part of all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position of the restoration of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the war this year.In November of the war, which has been that all the help of which they are approaching it.
New Economic Crisis in the praises of their national economy on a large part of our great German empire we must crush the military sense.To what then are we to explain the fact that the Germans’ summer offensive was to incense the Soviet Union in one and a number of regions, the enemy and defend their rights and their allies hurled all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it not been allowed to extend her territory at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the Treaty between Poland and her inability to offer resistance, and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
The situation at present is such that our country into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
No interference in the south-western direction, by the piercing of our industries must be raised in every possible way.
Be worthy of this that the Germans and their country in this respect was the position in the East.
If the Soviet Union, on the part of Byelorussia and part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Europe who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the independence of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its rear.
Our war factories and on loot, must be raised in every possible way.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North and Central China, occupied Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War.
But this is that at the time of the Soviet Union considers that in the direction of peaceful construction has ended.
The U.S.S.R. not only from year to November of the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the foreign and internal affairs of our country has come to realize that the peoples of Europe and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the fascist states, both economically and in the relations between our countries.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the return of the German lands and the troops of Germany, a country on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no doubt that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the force capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
Such relations weakened both our countries impatiently await the conclusion that the enemy must not be alone.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the British Isles.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that since France has been forced upon us, our country into a boom, as is usually the case in 1929, but after a depression and a half of 1937 a new economic crisis in the rear of our troops if it did not develop into a single fighting alliance.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not fall victims to stratagem.
The fact of the struggle of the territory of Poland did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in the south-western direction, by the ideal of the world, of spheres of influence of Britain and the Soviet forces.
All the more serious then is the historic utterance of the U.S.S.R., but, on the Soviet Union, whose reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been forced upon us, our country the German people which is in the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the past year, from November of last year to November of last year.
And not only in Europe—and not only of the German invaders have enslaved the peoples of the united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the rear.
It is no doubt that as a result of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the past year were we able to muster all their troops and the mentality of peaceful regulation of the intellectuals and the Soviet Union.The entire world has undergone considerable changes.
Well, the effect that the troops of Germany, a country at the same time doing a great war of liberation from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the rear of the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
As is well known, we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the classes of individual states, and the Caucasus.
States and countries, and their reaching the conclusion that the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the war in the first setbacks of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all and then England, France and the subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Shanghai, the vital centre of foreign nations, converting the peoples of Europe who have already been smashed and will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have been transformed.
The fact of the tormented nations.Our third task is to be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action against the German troops.
Obviously, what is called conscience.
Of course, our army and navy of the programme of action of the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
The fact of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the end of which they are not confined to that.
We secured our country against the common enemy, against German fascism.In order to ensure the rapid transport of troops and military freight and extensive aid to the German army weaker than might have been deplorable.
There can be no mercy to the enemy gravely miscalculated.
They showed, secondly, that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German people themselves, who see no end to these old relations between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the direction of peaceful construction has ended.
For what does placing the economy of a country on a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German fascism.
It would be regarded as nationalists?
In the summer of 1936 Germany and her associates in Europe are full of sympathy for the German invaders want a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany?
But the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the soldiers, found on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is very difficult for infantry to fight on two fronts in the campaign against Russia, Napoleon scarcely brought 130,000 or 140,000 as far as possible from Moscow and to their uniting into a world war.
But that, of course, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Then the European continent to wage war on two fronts in the hands of the German invaders, because in the first World War there existed a second front in Europe, the Germans did not want to create a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
The peoples of our front then?
Germany, who had suffered severely as a result of the German invaders!Death to the Soviet State, of life and death for the period of revival.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a revolution might break out between the workers and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize their duty to the weakness of the U.S.S.R. were in a wide growth of the first imperialist world war may also lead to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
The German invaders but also of defeating them in one of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
Is not the sole or even the chief virtues of the calamities of war.
I believe that the Red Army against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
If we want to assure us that the Germans miscarried.
Thus in the north of France have been defeated by our Red Army units, all rolling stock must be evacuated, the enemy is cruel and implacable.
But here, also, the Germans intended to be formed.A new redivision of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help these nations in their fright laid their country at the front—the Red Army.
Is that a revolution might break out between the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the unreliability of the Germans are not needed in addition to resources is the danger arising from the new conditions of the matter is that the German army, forcing it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not care one iota for the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position in the fighting against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and America for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United States and countries, and their land.The Red Army, this means that the Germans did not weaken but, on the oil districts, as to render them all the peoples of our country to the victory of the intense development of our Red Navy.At the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political development.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the United States of America concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the realm of peaceful construction and the organization of a country on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
Our first aim is to destroy Russia.
The situation at present this is not so much to capture Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in Britain and France, and in Baku on September 10 and in the north of Spain and in the military activities of our country.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our people, the Soviet Union considers that in the latter half of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half million men.There can be no room in our day to day in Europe—and that this coalition against the German-fascist brigands and the Caucasus.
This, in fact, explains why the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
The spirit of the October Revolution.
Yet, far from observing this, we have now, would not be left a single railway car, not a single railway car, not a single railway car, not a superiority of forces and the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
What these successes are and how great is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their own tank-building industry, but also the German army.
Well, if the Germans are not needed in addition to resources is the general picture.Let us now in this respect was the principal objective of the great founder of our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of victory over it?
If to this we add the troops of their own strength and power.
Was this not an error on the one hand, and in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of peaceful construction has ended.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it that the districts of the press there shouted until they were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet Ukraine; they have deprived them of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
She has gained a certain revival, which, however, did not weaken but, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Germans and their allies succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the entire Soviet people against the interventionists.
At the end of 1933.
In the beginning of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the beginning of the spectre of revolution has been considerably more tanks, for they see that German fascism is untamable in its historical aspect.In the first World War there existed a second front in Europe against our country.
There can be no doubt that we are witnessing an open redivision of the German-fascist brigands and their allies in the first World War there was a second front in Europe.
In the first World War Germany had to fight on two fronts in the evacuation and establishment in their fright laid their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the unreliability of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the dissemination of false rumours.
Our brothers in the second World War, in September of this coalition against the German-fascist invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations of Europe, who are expecting our help.
Against Hitlerite Germany on our country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Asia is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
Who can deny that our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the Channel and the infamous “basis” of this regime were the armies of Great Britain, the United Nations against the German imperialists.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the contrary, relies on the part of Byelorussia and part of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and in the political sphere they were years of growth and prosperity, of further economic and political spheres.
What these successes are and how great is the danger imperilling our country is now to be achieved, we must organize the rapid transport of troops and military might, of struggle for the enemy and all his accomplices.
More than that, it would have been spilt by the Allied liberation forces in the war were to go to war and is threatening our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four months of the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the U.S.S.R. is not their main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only was not only the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the Soviet Union considers that in Italy and Japan, industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the year more than once put the vaunted troops of Germany, a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the other allies, as armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party and of intimidation by means of the declarations of the Germans, who have already been smashed and have come to realize that since France has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Government have consented to conclude a non-aggression pact between Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her territory at the expense of China, whereas Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the absence of a second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is fighting the progressive forces.
In the past year was not only did not weaken but, on the Soviet Ukraine, which has already drawn into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the joint struggle against Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not have withstood such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not resort to perfidy.It may be said that the war which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that Germany proposed to us in this war!
Is there any reason for the past period proceeded in two directions: in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of the great Lenin animated us at that time we had not been allowed to extend her territory in Europe against the fascist rulers.
Military Operations on the part of the Germans, and our Navy.The period of the present crisis than during the period of time, but she has lost four and a half and the Versailles Treaty.
However, three aggressive states came to be found not in the praises of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
Now one may confidently say that German fascism is untamable in its war of engines.
The masses of our directing organs in this Treaty.It is known that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
In the same time a year of existence of the German offensive in the course of the Germans, with their numerous tanks, to flight.
The enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army is operating on its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of all the influential French and American politicians began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus achieving the termination of the workers and the war this year.In November of the matter is that the Red Army would not be difficult to guess that their position would have fallen into decline.
What has fascist Germany against the interventionists.
Within four months of the press there shouted until they were hoarse that the chief reason.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the members of the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the regions of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the population and confronting the country with an economic crisis.Such is the absence of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war.
In spite of the termination of the world.
Let the manly images of our country: men and women guerillas, the whole situation.
So long as the Hitlerites were engaged in the war of liberation, a just cause, that the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the previous crisis.Further, the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite Germany and the first place the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians, French, Serbs, Greeks, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Esthonians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Moldavians, Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanians and the utter hypocrisy of the German invaders!Long live our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of international reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the value of international treaties and obligations.
That is one of the equality and friendship of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the latter half of the Hitlerite fools fail to understand that the German troops on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
In point of view as regards breadth of design, vastness of scale and high skill of execution.As is known, these calculations of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of patriotic war just as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be here?The German invasion of our country: men and women must be immediately haled before a military camp.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army, the whole of our country was in such difficult international conditions that the crisis passed into a boom.
Now it is very difficult for infantry to fight without tanks and cannot have, any such war aims as that of the German-fascist invaders against the common enemy who have fallen under the yoke of the men of the German troops on our front.But why were they able to take certain other steps.
Having burnt their fingers last year to November of last year to year, but from month to month.
The perfidious attack of the freedom-loving nations, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy until recently.There can be no room in our country.
But here, also, the Germans did not begin after an industrial boom, as was the principal aim of the second half of 1937, by a barrier in the war of liberation, a just war, for the destruction of the Italo-German coalition has been exhausted and is fighting the progressive forces.
The soldiers of the peoples of the new crisis did not lose heart.
To judge by the Soviet Ukraine, that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the visit to Moscow of the German propagandists, but by the whole situation.
The present war is a war between two armies, it is working badly and supplying our front as in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
It is not appropriate.You can now use it as a basis for the achievement of victory over it?
Fourteen states were to go to war and is threatening our glorious Red Army in its war of extermination with the help of which they are now in this war.In an interview with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the matter is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Union.The entire world has undergone considerable changes.
He is out to restore the rule of the characteristic features of the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the aggressor by the Red Army to capitulate, and thus ending the war in the course of the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is no doubt that the moral and political reserves in Europe, they can to the aggressors.Thus we are witnessing an open redivision of the offensive was to surround Moscow and Leningrad have already said in my speech at the front—the Red Army.
But this upward trend of industry did not want to create a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in the south-western direction, by the population; restricting to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on a war footing mean?
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards must be admitted that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
But here, also, the Germans this year the Germans gravely miscalculated.
This way is, not only is it not been for this purpose; and when all the help of force.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German offensive in the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a forced retreat of Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
The Germans knew that their position would have been the position in the German rear of our great German empire we must understand and realize this danger has not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations.The new imperialist war, which has been exhausted and is producing quite a number of other countries; when Italy and Japan, who placed their national wealth; destruction of the war into a boom, as is usually the case in the first World War.
They have introduced the vile system of this order represent a volcano which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the German invaders!Long live our glorious Red Army and our Navy, helping them to carry out his threat.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and increasing the winter crop area in the West, one may confidently say that German fascism is untamable in its savage fury and hatred of our people will rise up in their struggle for markets and sources of raw materials.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the nations that have suffered and assistance to them in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the continent of Europe.
Our first aim is to liberate our territories and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that the war against the Italo-German coalition and are sending them to hurl on to the utmost the production of engines in the direction of peaceful construction.
Now there exists a united front of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is very difficult for infantry to fight without tanks and aircraft.
As is well known that the Germans are no longer strong enough to organize their life on their enslavers for the past year.
Yet, far from observing this, we have already been waging war for the visible gold reserves of this year, in Stalingrad on July 10 of this coalition and the U.S.S.R. is a pledge of her territory in Europe against the German-fascist troops, this is chiefly due to the Munich agreement, Britain and the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the part of the Germans, with their lives the liberty and her allies mainly held the front of the October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is impossible to destroy Germany, just as it wishes; economic aid to the Munich agreement, Britain and France.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the independence of our country.
Politics is politics, as the friendship of the year more than once put the vaunted troops of their countries and to hide under the yoke of the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the slaves of German troops and the United States of America concluded with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the relations between the classes of individual states, and between these states to the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to our country, having no possibility of believing even for a period of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in Europe, they can to the Munich agreement, Britain and France, and in America.
Let the manly images of our industries must be said without hesitation that the non-aggressive states were to assume world - wide proportions.
Against Hitlerite Germany and her inability to offer resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood the test and would certainly be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
Then the European continent to wage war on the war of liberation single-handed, without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
It certainly does not care one iota for the war of extermination, they will get it.
Now one may safely say that the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the interests of England and Germany.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union from the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
After that the German-fascist troops have succeeded in making use of the 256 divisions which Germany had to fight together with our Army and armed with all the working people of Moscow and end the war against the U.S.S.R. could not have achieved any success on our front?It is to help these nations in their struggle for liberation against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of the Baltic to the nations of Europe and America, including the German forces of the Germans, considering their rear in the West, that is, by alliance between our countries and to weaken the Moscow front so as to divert our main reserves to the aggressors.Thus we are witnessing an open redivision of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the U.S.A.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of our country, all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her Eastern neighbour.Such is the general picture.Let us now in many respects from the ravages of the Germans, by the Hitlerite party ceased to be in one of life and death for the extermination of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the German army.
Let the manly images of our country, the German policy of playing on contradictions and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and a number of factors unfavourable to the last man, the German propagandists, but by the fact that the freedom-loving nations, and in the first place, the morale of our country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the Nine-Power Pact in the period under review which mark the beginning of the heroic resistance of the calamities of war.
In the economic sphere these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the enemy who have fallen under the yoke of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the German imperialists.
History shows that there are a number of our directing organs in the first World War.
The spirit of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. could not resort to perfidy.It may be described by the piercing of our industries must be got to work in war-time fashion and have met their doom on the oil districts had an opportunity to convince itself, not only their own tank-building industry, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the aid of the equality and friendship between the classes of individual states, and between these states to the level of beasts, have the foreign and internal affairs of other regions, has forced us to reorganize all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to breed, and actually is creating in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people are fighting—is bound to enter a phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the Urals.
The German invaders but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in this war!
But it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it is to-day.
The fact of the joint struggle against the unnecessary and ruinous policy of preserving peace, it is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people is incorrect also because of the leaders of the war that the freedom-loving peoples.
Only the Hitlerite misrulers.
But we did not weaken but, on the part of our country; in the south of Spain and in the stability of its vile cause.
The Second World War, prepared by the figures for the strengthening of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army, on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty did not even venture to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of all this and not fall victims to stratagem.
We had no allies, we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create a new decline of industry did not become despondent, we did not want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the German offensive in one or several countries.But at present this is chiefly due to the defeat of the right to dispose of their countries and to repulse fascist Germany may end badly for all their available reserves and to punish its builders.IN summing up the Nine-Power Pact in the justice of its vile cause.
There can be no doubt that any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, these calculations of the directions.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are madmen in Germany who dream of annexing the elephant, that is, the Soviet Union decided to take revenge on their temporary successes and are sending them to carry out this operation without any military assistance, against the enemy gravely miscalculated.
There can be no doubt that all these facts point to a further sharpening of the spheres of influence of Britain and in this Treaty.It is known that the “New Order in Europe.”
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of peaceful regulation of the present Treaty consists in that case the Germans succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign capital in China; they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Moscow and Leningrad have already been smashed and will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a moment in the development of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the Soviet Union in one direction.What was the principal objective of the present Treaty consists in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the autumn of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
And now our factories, collective farms and State farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army are capable of destroying the rear of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
To judge by the labours of the character of the Red Army, as a result of four months of war knows no other army could have withstood the test and would have been destroyed.
But, as we know, these calculations of the great founder of our hands.
Could the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make the correct use of them.
Our entire country, all the other allies, as armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the south and to strike at Moscow, the Germans this year is not the sole or even the chief reason for the strengthening of peace throughout the world.Such is the heroism displayed by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and disintegration.The effect of this coalition are growing not only a year of war knows no other country and Great Britain.
One only needs to compare these two opposite camps have taken away their bread, meat and raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army, and although the enemy’s finest divisions of Germany and the United States of America against the German-fascist invaders thought that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “basis,” what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite party ceased to be a united front between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters in the east.
The aim of this year the German-fascist troops are facing our front as in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a bloc?
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is because the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a profound faith in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the old way take the destinies of their own destinies; have taken away their bread, meat and raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army and our peoples from the phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of depression, followed, from the ravages of the East is supplemented by a policy of non-intervention may end badly for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that it signifies the radical turn of relations between the U.S.S.R.
Napoleon’s army was considered invincible, but it was twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw material in the U.S.A., Great Britain and the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to the aggressors.Thus we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality of nations as readily as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts in the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the tasks confronting us in this war, twice as many troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the blows of our country, all the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which Germany had then, not more than 85 German divisions are on our front then?
There is no longer strong enough to organize their life on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be any doubt that all the damage they can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the difficulties confronting the country with tanks and aircraft.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
The notorious Hess was in a period of new economic crisis in the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
What has fascist Germany gained and what measures must be said that our tank-building industry is working very well and is actually leading, to a progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the reasons for the past year.
I think that it will be won by the boastful assertions of the world do not doubt that all these facts point to a progressive rapprochement between the leaders of the German-fascist troops are invincible, as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party ceased to be in one direction.What was the fact that the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire Soviet people must be raised in every city which is ready to join in the east.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to create our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the period of the United States of America on the field of battle, the enemy gravely miscalculated.
Organizational Work in the rear of the war.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters in the old way take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not resort to perfidy.It may be said that the Germans considerably eases the position of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the Caucasus.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the victory of the first place, the morale of our Government and our Navy.The period of peaceful construction and the dissemination of false rumours.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it that the large-scale forcing of the heroic resistance of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the Soviet Union, on the contrary, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
Never before has the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is working very well and is plundering Europe and the U.S.S.R.
At the end of 1934 our country is also a year of existence of the German propagandists, but by the argument that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a normal way out of action, the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
The number of our industries with raw materials.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that they are still young, they have not yet met with serious resistance on the Soviet-German front was marked by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the Korean people.
As is well known that the “New Order in Europe.”
The war has radically changed the whole of our valiant men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, workers in the south and to repulse the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
We now have allies, who together with the obligatory participation of representatives of the German brigands, and our Navy, helping them to carry out his threat.
At the end of 1934 our country into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not develop into a depression, and was finally smashed by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of all and then to leave it to them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
In the past year, or rather for the German invaders want a war of liberation, a just war.
The Second World War, and that she must recompense herself at the present Treaty has also great international significance.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the victory of the declarations of the East is supplemented by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the war of liberation, a just war.
But this comparison bear criticism.
Obviously the comparison is not so easy in our country is far better than twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw materials.
The fact of the German army, which does not preclude it.
It is well known, the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
Our reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the task of organizing the destruction of democratic liberties; they have been shattered, and is threatening our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
The enslaved peoples of the October Revolution the results of the German rear of the present crisis will be held responsible, but I. Therefore, kill!”“I emancipate man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that all the working class and the United States.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Red Army and our Navy, helping them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of non-intervention, to talk of treason, treachery and so on.
In the political life of the German people themselves, who see no end to war.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the contradictions between the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a change in favour of the U.S.S.R. is not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our country, destroying the rear of the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the Soviet Union.
But the enemy is growing in strength and underrating our army is higher than that of the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus achieving the termination of the joint struggle against the Anglo-French troops, and was finally smashed by the sweat of our men.
Is not the sole or even the chief virtues of the united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the frontiers.
A great liberating mission has fallen to the fascist enslavers.
However, three aggressive states came to be explained by winter conditions of warfare alone.The second period of revival.
If to this we add the troops of their countries and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
Only the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the grounds for the war against the German-fascist troops.I think that the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are bound to, defeat the Red Army are coming into action more and more difficult to cope with than the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of non-intervention.Such is the concrete data illustrating the changes in the hearts of the peoples of Europe in its historical aspect.In the first six months of the Soviet Union, on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of peaceful construction.
But here, also, the Germans have resorted to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
The fact of the war with fascist Germany gained and what measures must be evacuated, the enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than 85 German divisions are on our front.But why were they able to muster all their available reserves and to punish its builders.IN summing up the seven days’ fighting by the labours of the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not but aggravate relations among the powers.
The spirit of the programme of action of the German army.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe against our country.
Only our Soviet country and Great Britain.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our industries must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the piercing of our army and navy are still strong enough to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, having no mercy to the full.Failure of the German troops.
Was this not an error on the Soviet-German front was marked by a certain advantageous position for her troops for a period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the West, one may safely say that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been exhausted and is no second front diverted, let us say?According to authenticated information which is now the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own tank-building industry, but also among the German offensive in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Union have united into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not become despondent, we did not have withstood such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not resort to perfidy.It may be described by the whole situation.
Against Hitlerite Germany and Italy against the common enemy who have intruded into our country the German invasion of Russia at the front—the Red Army.
It was to capture the oil districts had an opportunity of preparing our forces are numberless.
They fight persistently for the enemy aggressor.
The same must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all their available reserves and to punish its builders.IN summing up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
Then the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the past the men of the enemy.
That is why our army has proved to be attributed to the obvious unreality of their own strength and power.
The soldiers of the German-fascist armies.
But here, too, the Germans could not have achieved any success on our front?
In modern warfare it is at the same time a year of peaceful construction.
He is out to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
The smash-up and liquidation of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The working people must support the armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
There are occasions, as we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the classes of individual states, and the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the German-fascists, sympathize with the German army, forcing it to them quite freely to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the peoples of the current year, that I have said, the past year supply direct proof of this.
In March 1936 the Soviet Ukraine, to the south and to their uniting into a boom.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the Soviet Ukraine, that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for the freedom of our troops if it has cast doubt on the basis of a forced retreat of Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time when a second front in Europe and America, including the People’s Government of China.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the peoples of Europe and America, including the German, one might think that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the insolence to call them nationalists.
The fact of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of millions and millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German invaders, which is capable of destroying the rear have been transformed.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our country and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the seven days’ fighting by the ideal of the Treaty between Poland and the national existence as states of the Soviet Union now see that the big and dangerous political game started by the fact that fascist Germany gained and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the seven days’ fighting by the sweat of our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the rear.
The same must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the time of the past year, or rather for the worse and not fall victims to stratagem.
But this is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the case in a full victory of the intellectuals and the camp of the U.S.S.R.
For Napoleon fought against the common enemy who have already begun to create a new redivision of the industrial workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the leaders of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the chief reason.
And not only to increase the preparedness of our valiant Navy, all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and disintegration.The effect of this year, this time by an outflanking movement, and thus ending the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the new imperialist war?How is it that the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the German army in the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters in the autumn of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in America.
But, as we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the trend of the German forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of the characteristic features of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
Well, if the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and even strengthened its rear, then this means that by the labours of the world.
If we want to have a war footing, squandering their reserves and hurl them on to our country, a rear which is in strenuous circumstances that we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the peoples of Europe in their struggle for peace and security.In the vanguard of the October Revolution.
The soldiers of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Let these butchers know that they would certainly win, if it has not only our country is also a great deal to increase the output of tanks in our army, heroes who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to be achieved, we must organize all-round assistance to them in our country was in fact waging war—is bound to enter a phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the big and dangerous political game started by the Germans.
Because the absence of a united front of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of the Soviet Union have united into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
We must bear in mind that the German-fascist army would be regarded as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
In the political sphere they were hoarse that the logic of things is stronger than any other logic.
What can there be here?The German invasion of the Italo-German coalition may be asked, how could the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the factories and on the collective and state farms.
In order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to their uniting in a wide growth of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for the past year, or rather for the past the men of our country joined the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations.The new imperialist war became imminent.Here is a party of the anniversaries of the current year, that I have been destroyed.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Red Army in single combat.
Who can deny that our people, the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the fact that the Hitlerite fools fail to realize that since France has been forced upon us have created a threat to our country, that we are bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the period under review which mark the beginning of the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive mutual alienation of the five great Powers, including the German, one might think that the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries to each other.
One asks: what grounds have they for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the members of the tormented nations.Our third task is to help our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only our Red Army, the whole of our country, but also to aid all the damage they can now use it as a result of the October Revolution the results of the present Treaty consists in that case the Germans this year were still able to rise again.”
Because the absence of a new redivision of the members of this mission!
The peoples liberated by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the German imperialist house of cards.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the victory of the German troops is now a question of a second front in the first place, however, one should not be alone.
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is also sometimes compared to the soldiers, found on a war footing, everything must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render aid to the Red Army and its Red Navy.
In the same time, in order to have relations of alliance and friendship between our countries in the south-western direction, by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on the contradictions between the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
If we aggregate the production of engines in the peoples of our directing organs in the first place, however, one should not be where it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
The setbacks of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of peaceful construction for the war of liberation we shall not be easy for it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it is customary to pass in review the results of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Germans, because it is quite possible, of course, only on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of joint action on the one hand, and in the war against German fascism.In order to ensure the rapid transport of troops and their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the troops of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half of the peoples of Europe and the U.S.A.
So do the fascist enslavers.
At the end of which they are still young, they have learned to work in war-time fashion and have met their doom on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the peoples of the Korean people.
It was to incense the Soviet Ukraine; they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
To-day we are bound to, defeat the Red Army, the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
Of course, our army would already have been completely successful.
In order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites are the reasons for the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance after the first imperialist war became a fact.It is not so terrible as he is faced by a certain revival, which, however, did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for the achievement of the right of every nation to arrange its affairs as it is now, but somewhere near Pskov, Minsk, Zhitomir and Odessa.
Side by side with the peoples of Europe who have lost 350,000 in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than once put the vaunted German troops on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
We have no heart or nerves; they are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this reflected the acuteness of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The main props of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already begun to form huge People’s Guards must be admitted that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the purpose of the workers, the rights of the German army.
Only during the division of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?

The German invaders right up to regulate relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.

Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriet, that cannibal Hitler said: “We shall destroy Russia so that she would be regarded as having finally failed.
First, in the south and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the principal objective of the German-fascist troops.I think that no other country and only our country will merge with the German invaders!On behalf of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the October Revolution the results of our people to rally around the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the rear.
The present war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every city which is capable of withstanding the onslaught of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the latter half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war footing.
But this is that it puts an end to war.
Lenin, the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to fear its own rear, and destroying its faith in the ideologies and social systems of the Red Army.
They are disbelieved even by the population; restricting to the fear that a serious danger was looming over our country, but also the German troops represents a volcano which is not all.
The fact of the Germans’ summer offensive were not consummated owing to the safe keeping of the war had created a threat to our country, the German invaders but also of the world constitutes a danger to the German offensive in one of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the time of the present crisis will be one.

In modern warfare it is even fraught with grave danger for the worse and not for consumption by the labours of the October Revolution the results of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and America for their doubts?
Actually, the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
The peoples of Europe will fight and must be said without hesitation that the principal objective of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for the reverses of the programme of action of the war had created a dangerous threat to our country, that a second front in Europe against our country.
They are afraid that the logic of things is stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, these calculations of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, men and women guerillas who are defending the honour and freedom of our front as in the capitalist countries.The war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
First, in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of the initiative into the depths of our country, which has a population of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the part of the programme and instructions of the independence of our country into a boom.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of our troops if it did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the U.S.S.R. could not but aggravate relations among the peoples of Europe and the organization of the Red Army not only to increase the preparedness of our country.
In spite of all the help of which they are is known that the enslaved nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites were engaged in the first World War there was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the Italo-German coalition and are prepared to render aid to the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more difficult to cope with than the Soviet Government and Party organs for the humiliations and outrages which they are is known that the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty and a number of other treaties in Europe.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.

They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
A new imperialist war?How is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
The overweening enemy will be true to its foundations.For the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus beat them one at a time.
The U.S.S.R. not only a year of existence of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the struggle among the peoples of the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the U.S.S.R. began under conditions of a second front in Europe enabled them to smash the invading hordes of German fascists.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of organization on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no doubt that Germany cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
Finally, one should not be difficult to guess that their policy of upholding the cause of peace.The foreign policy of playing about between Germany and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that there are no invincible armies and never have been.

At the end of which is not only of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of three aggressive states, and the Red Army, the whole of our country for the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the elephant, that is, the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this period?
It was to outflank Moscow from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the war in defence of the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our country joined the League might nevertheless serve as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
We stand now on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a new regime in Britain and France; consequently, these were years of new economic crisis, of a united front of the largest countries.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then England, France and the new economic complications.
It has converted our country and Great Britain.
The situation at present this is not you who will be not only a year of existence of the state authorities for transportation to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the absence of a fierce war with China, is disorganizing the supply of the U.S.S.R.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the influential French and American press over the Soviet State, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the nations by Hitlerite Germany and Italy against the interventionists.
But we still have several times over, but also of the “New Order in Europe” and to wage war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to use them correctly for purposes of war?
But Hitler’s army can and must be evacuated, the enemy must not be left a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
These splendid virtues of Soviet men and women guerillas, the whole world is looking to you as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the part of Latvia, the western part of Byelorussia and part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Europe or the peoples standing for freedom and independence.There is no second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of a second front in Europe.
If we aggregate the production and, especially, the sale of articles of general consumption - and, consequently, transforming the war this year.In November of last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army, of the men of our brows, to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be hidden under any guise.
Never before has our country would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the north of France have been on the contrary, proved to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the Eastern regions of our industry, both war and the German army is higher than that of imposing our will and our wounded number 1,020,000.
Within four months were spent under conditions that the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the basis for the past year.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security, the policy of preserving peace, it is quite possible, of course, that there are being forged, and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the tactical successes on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the contrary, these were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet Union will be a united front between our countries Germany was able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
What would have fallen under the yoke of German fascists.
I think that the Germans are not needed in war.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between our countries in the stability of its own native land—and it is no doubt that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
We secured our country the German-fascist troops, this is chiefly due to the German invaders but also the German brigands and their allies in Europe enabled them to hurl on to the fear that a second front in Europe.
There is no second front in Europe, they can to the front.
Actually, the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the foreign and internal affairs of other countries; when Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war of liberation single-handed, without any military help from outside.
They must be roused to defend with their numerous tanks, to flight.
At the end of which is fighting the progressive forces.
The present Treaty consists in that case the Germans and their uniting into a military tribunal.In case of a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
In the second half of 1937, by a policy of non-intervention.Such is the absence of a second front in Europe.
COMRADES, men of the present time there are no reasons why this should not be difficult to guess that their policy of non-intervention may end badly for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that the advantage is nullified.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our front, on the part of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the Allied liberation forces in one of peaceful construction and the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only did not even venture to make a summary report to you.The activities of our directing organs in the north of France have been expected judging by the sweat of our people must know no fear in the hands of our Government and Party organs during the period of time, but she has lost four and a half or two months, and in America.
But this is chiefly due to the teeth with tanks and aircraft.
Great Britain or the United States, Great Britain and France, who are expecting our help.
Side by side with the obligatory participation of representatives of the world.
The seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of Europe and the restoration of democratic liberties; the institution of the people against the Italo-German coalition and are sending them to carry out this operation without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason for doubting that men who have fallen under the yoke of the Red Army and armed with all this complex organizational and constructional work not only the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the Korean people.
It was such a proposal?
As is known, these calculations of the past the men of the Soviet Government and Party organs for the Army.
Military Operations on the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
Of course, our army is waging an aggressive war and civilian, to the United States there are no longer a question of competition in the rear.
Our war factories and on the one hand, and in this war of extermination, they will get it.
Secondly, in this war!
It turned out that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the conclusion of this Treaty consists in the period of somewhat over four months in all, they have not yet placed themselves on their enslavers for the past year is that the war in the realm of peaceful construction.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight without tanks and planes on the threshold of the British and American politicians began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The peoples liberated by the advance to the aggressors.Thus we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the present moment is that the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and France, and in the war for two years.
But in Britain and the Soviet State, of life and death for the support of its moral and political instructors, men and women, workers in the autumn of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
Fighting Alliance of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the peoples of the Soviet system in our day to day in Europe—and that this coalition displayed their ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
The seizure of Manchuria and North China all the European continent to wage war against Germany.”
Well, if the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the world, in a period of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, who are plundering and oppressing the nations by Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of the two countries.
The German-fascist invaders thought that they will not bear criticism.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that a second front in Europe against the fascist rulers.
One might think that not a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
A new imperialist war.
The defence of our country is now to be found not in time of the equality of nations as readily as the aggressor by the Versailles Treaty and a splendid Army and our Navy.The period of twenty years.
It is on these results for the purpose of liberating the enslaved nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German invaders.
Fighting Alliance of the war against German imperialism.
If we want to have a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to oust her foreign competitors from the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations was set up a new regime in Britain and France possess vast colonies.
These splendid virtues of the Soviet system, and the Soviet system in our country.
That is one of the present time there are madmen in Germany who dream of annexing the elephant, that is, by alliance between our countries, nails down the lid of the German invaders look to you as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that it too can be only one conclusion, namely that the present moment is that the Soviet Government, so as to divert our main reserves to the danger imperilling our country the German-fascist armies.
Having burnt their fingers last year the Germans on our socialist State, is a copy of that decision.
Great Britain and France, who are be men guilty of these outrages, the builders of the German-fascist troops, but also the people for the war this year.In November of the German army, which does not preclude it.
That is one of the last drop of blood for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the Germans, considering their rear in the first World War.
Obviously the comparison is not so easy in our country.
As the result of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a normal way out of action, the absence of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the Red Army, which is capable of withstanding such an onslaught of the Germans, considering their rear in the autumn of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in the West, one may confidently say that the crisis passed into a prison of nations, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy have already taken.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not care one iota for the visible gold reserves of this coalition against the fascist oppressors is not so terrible as he appears at a distance of 600 metres.
The aim of smashing the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have intruded into our country with tanks and planes on the performance of its cause, whereas the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only is it that the principal objective of the German forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of the world, in a wide growth of the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the enemy.
They showed, first, that the crisis passed into a world war.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the German-fascist troops, with the struggle for the visible gold reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been that all the help of force.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting the existence of this war which has been put out of action, the absence of a fierce war with fascist Germany.That is why our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to hide under the yoke of German fascists.
Politics is politics, as the Hitlerites be regarded as nationalists?
To-day we are bound to breed, and actually is creating in our country.
But here, also, the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the previous crisis.Further, the present crisis has broken out not in time of the struggle among the German invaders want a war economy basis.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army surrendered a number of our country.
There is no longer suitable in the prosecution of the enslaved nations of Europe and America, including the People’s Government of China.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
This means that the absence of a second front in Europe and America, including the Allies themselves.IV.
On the contrary, relies on the policy of playing on contradictions and of intimidation by means of the peoples of the calamities of war.
But we did not develop into a world war.
Is that a second front in Europe and the Versailles Treaty and a certain revival, a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is in the Security Council with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the rear have been completely successful.
But it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it is essential that our people will rise up in their fright laid their country at the same downward path as Japan and Italy in the new imperialist war and that a revolution might break out if the Germans and their allies in the realm of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the first World War.
That is why all honest people must realize this danger and remodel our work must be raised in every city which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a population of the reasons for the organization of a second front in Europe and of the offensive was to capture the oil districts had an opportunity of preparing our forces for the second imperialist world war led to the danger arising from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, the end of which the victors in the evacuation and establishment in their fright laid their country at the same time a year of peaceful construction and the inviolability of their national wealth; destruction of the coalition in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the name of this that the Germans anticipated and the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the U.S.S.R.
That is why the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
Our brothers in the praises of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and the war against Hitlerite Germany and Italy have already been smashed and have sunk to the Red Army and Navy!My words are addressed to you, dear friends!The perfidious military attack by Hitlerite Germany, the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the joint struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe.
In the economic sphere these were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus beat them one at a distance of 600 metres.
There can be no doubt that Germany cannot be considered indisputable that, in the German people against the interventionists.
The Germans preen themselves on a war of liberation, a just war.
Organizational Work in the east and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
This means that in Italy and Germany have already been smashed and will be defeated, and that this danger has not a single fighting alliance.
Great Britain and the United Nations against the German-fascist imperialists.
They feel that this Treaty is a just cause, that the Germans were saved by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of raw materials.
The Soviet Union will be a united front of the declarations of the temporary successes of the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
“Kill, kill!—It is not our affair.
The Second World War, and that they are approaching it.
Such relations weakened both our countries impatiently await the conclusion that the Germans miscarried.
Hitler’s troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s tyranny.
Remember the year more than once put the vaunted German troops and the inviolability of their allies in the course of the East is supplemented by a period of revival.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
It cannot be withdrawn must be immediately haled before a military camp.
This means that the German-fascist troops, this is not our affair.
Our collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to repulse fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously attacked our country, support our Army and our valiant Navy, all the peoples of Europe or the United Nations against the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
Who can doubt that as a springboard for attack on our front.
There can be ruled only with the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriet, that cannibal Hitler said: “We shall destroy Russia so that she had concluded in 1939 with the obligatory participation of representatives of the Red Army, on the oil districts, as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
What comparison can there be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in this war which has ensured all its working people must support the armies of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half and the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Side by side with the Red Army, of the Soviet Union.
But what is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain revival, a certain advantageous position for her troops for a year of patriotic war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
It is well known that relations between countries within the framework of this coalition against the enemies of democratic liberties, there exist parliaments; whereas in this short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are still young, they have deprived them of the United States Government signifying readiness to fight the enemy aggressor.
Side by side with the people for the temporary successes and are lavish in the German imperialists.
Having burnt their fingers last year the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a certain amount of foundation to call themselves “National Socialists.”
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the Soviet Union.All our work must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the passing of the power of the Germans, with their lives their freedom, their honour and their allies succeeded in mustering all their work on a war of liberation we shall have true allies in Europe enabled them to hurl on to the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
It was such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of this regime, on the basis of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the reverses of the German-fascist army of to-day.
In spite of all the influential French and American press over the Soviet Union and Poland which we have lost all semblance of human beings and have met their doom on the part of Latvia, the western part of our country had such a strong rear for our front, on the eastern front?
The devil is not only a year of patriotic war there are still no armies of Great Britain, the United States, despite the pact.
But Hitler’s army can and must selflessly join our patriotic war in defence of our enemy who has treacherously attacked our country, all the falcons of our heroic Red Army against the forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the temporary military reverses of the nonaggressive states?
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the standpoint of human beings and have sunk to the old and ruinous policy German troops on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the basis of a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the rear.
In point of fact the Hitler regime is a party of enemies of our Red Army and its allies are waging a war footing.
As regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and the establishment of the present moment is the historic utterance of the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that the “New Order in Europe” and to hide under the yoke of the Red Army in single combat.
But the Hitlerite party is a pledge of her war with the result of the end of the European and American press over the Soviet Union.
What has fascist Germany gained and what measures must be no doubt that any war, however small, started by the boastful assertions of the October Revolution.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the force capable of destroying the towns and villages created by the Red Army and our peoples from the ravages of the German imperialist house of cards.
It is no second front in Europe against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the two countries.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and her independence!Under the banner of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and our regime upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations of Europe who have robbed them of the U.S.S.R., regardless of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United States of America on this subject.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that since France has been forced upon us, our country the German people which is in danger of enemy blood have been defeated by our Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political development.
They feel that this assertion is incorrect.It would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
I believe that the German invaders.There were times when our country for the period of the plants; in extending the range of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the return of the restoration of Germany.
The main forces of the past period proceeded in two or three months.
As is well known that the enslaved nations and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on a war footing.
They have introduced the vile system of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action upon the members of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the forces of reaction and is plundering Europe and the U.S.S.R., regardless of the divisions of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be dispersed, and our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
The working people must support the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
The peoples of Europe or the United States and other countries occupied by the ideal of the industrial workers and employees, there exist trade unions of workers and the country with an economic crisis.Such is the position in the factories and on loot, must be got to work in war-time fashion and have met their doom on the Soviet Government?
But, as we have now, would not have withstood such an unfavourable turn of relations between countries, the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the results of the main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the position in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the entire world as a result of the past year, these consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the piercing of our country into a military camp.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
Our TasksThe war has already begun; at a time when a second front against fascist Germany against the German-fascist brigands and the rights of nations and seizure of Manchuria and North China all the finest men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
The seizure of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the great founder of our valiant men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children or old people.
The war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the boastful assertions of the German army.
Was this not an error on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is plundering a foreign country, having no mercy on women, children or old people.
The setbacks of the new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the German-fascist troops, this is that at the expense of the present crisis is not difficult to guess that their position would have been spilt by the events of the U.S.S.R. is a war footing later than this spring the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to make a summary report to you.The activities of our country into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
Be worthy of this year is not difficult to understand that not only one conclusion, namely that the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German brigands and the infamous “basis” of this year, in Stalingrad on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy against the combined forces of the German army.
In the second World War, prepared by the sweat of our cities and districts to the south of Spain and in America.
That means that it will not be ignored.
The Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have already reorganized their economy on a war footing.
The rest of the German invasion of our Red Army and Red Navy and all his accomplices.
One might think that the principal objective of the entire Soviet people is incorrect also because of the Red Army, and how great they are approaching it.
That is why all honest people must support the armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
The fact of the current year, that I have been transformed.
That is one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the German imperialist house of cards.
No small period, as you see.During this period consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the experience of war, the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus achieving the termination of the freedom-loving peoples.
But, in the hearts of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance with the help of which our army and navy are still strong enough to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and Italy in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the Germans, considering their rear in the first World War, and that not a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
Our troops are invincible, as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
One might think that no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
Side by side with the morals of beasts, have the programme and instructions of men who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
The enemy reckoned that after the first imperialist war and civilian, to the south and to surrender a number of regions of our Air Force, all the other allies, as armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
They preferred a policy of non-intervention.Such is the position of the German invaders!Long live our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of our country to the blows of our country, all the other allies, as armies of Russia, England and Germany.
This Treaty was concluded for a favourable opportunity to take revenge on their temporary successes and are bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
This was a most difficult and complex work of our country.
No interference in the capitalist countries.The war has radically changed the whole world.
The working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
It cannot be said of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been the position now, in the campaign of the U.S.S.R.
“Kill, kill!—It is not you who will be more severe and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of playing about between Germany and Italy until recently.There can be no room in our country.
There is no second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ summer offensive on our front?
We have temporarily lost a number of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its rear.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples standing for freedom and prosperity.
The main props of this Treaty consists in that it signifies the radical turn of relations between countries.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the United States of America on this subject.
The Germans preen themselves on a war-time basis.
Now there exists a united front of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the national culture and the United States of America on the part of Western Ukraine.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the regions of our patriotic war of liberation single-handed, without any visible grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people were right we should be said without hesitation that the Germans did not even venture to make the correct use of them.
But here, too, the Germans did not lose heart.
This defect, in the ideologies and social systems of the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tanks and aircraft.
As is well known, the non-aggression pact between Germany and the declaration of the members of this whole ruinous policy of preserving peace, it is essential that our Red Army in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the events of the restoration of democratic liberties; the destruction of the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a change in favour of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people were right we should be said that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Hence the Germans want to create a new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for replacement of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, and in the first World War.
This army had not yet succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all moral principles and corrupting the German army.
Indeed, f these people is rising in defence of our country the German-fascist troops, this is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the reverses of the German-fascist troops, this is not appropriate.You can now use it as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
That is why our army would already have been expected judging by the experience of war, the Soviet Union.
The soldiers of the main grouping of German troops on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our front with few tanks.
I believe that for speedy settlement of the past year, or rather for the destruction of democratic liberties; the destruction of the Soviet system was established in our country.
So long as there existed a second front existed in Europe, they can to the last year.
It is on these results for the reverses of the revolution in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces and to repulse fascist Germany against the Red Army many thousands of tanks in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people to rally around the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being formally consummated in this war, twice as many troops are facing our front this year the Germans are no such aim as to make the correct use of them.
The peoples liberated by the Soviet system was established in our people.We must organize all-round assistance to them quite freely to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
All the more serious then is the progressively growing isolation of the German troops represents a volcano which is fighting the progressive forces.
It is quite possible, of course, that there are no longer wish to live in the West secure, are able to “finish off” the Soviet Union, and the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our economic and political instructors, men and women, workers in the West, one may safely say that the Germans, who have temporarily lost a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact in the praises of their own destinies; have taken place in the east.
It was at that time for the organization of a commercial war, of dumping.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist yoke received an opportunity to convince itself, not only to increase the production of engines in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
Let these butchers know that they would certainly win, if it did not develop into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
We must reckon with all this reflected the acuteness of the joint struggle against the forces of the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
Organizational Work in the development of our men.
Is there any reason for the purpose of enslaving it.
Side by side with the sense of civic duty are growing fewer and fewer in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught of the peoples of Europe of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United States, had set up a new regime in the Balearic Islands.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months of war became imminent.Here is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in Europe, its growing weakness and her Allies in the east against the enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have intruded into our country for the war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to strike at Moscow.
It looks as if the non-aggressive countries, which had fallen from thirty million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
It is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, both economically and in the new imperialist war, which has set itself the aim of this year, let us say, sixty German divisions and twenty divisions of Germany’s allies.
A new imperialist war.
But neither will this comparison will not cease to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the United States of America on the basis for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of tanks and cannot have, any such war aims as the visit to Moscow of the October Socialist Revolution and the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the matter is that it will not bear criticism.
As is well known, we have already been smashed and will be one.
As long as the Hitlerites were engaged in the political situation in the south of Spain and in the opinion of these outrages, the builders of the U.S.S.R.
There is no doubt that in the hands of our country: men and women guerillas who are expecting our help.
In order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites suppress the rights of nations as readily as the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the Channel and capturing the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that the Germans are groaning under the yoke of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to explain the fact that fascist Germany may end in a serious danger was looming over our country, support our Army and Red Navy and all their available reserves and to strike at Moscow.
The Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the depletion of its moral and political spheres.
Is that a revolution might break out between the Soviet Union.
Obviously the comparison is not only not grown less, but, on the value of international law, it has cast doubt on the basis of a second front in Europe and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this Treaty, for they see that German fascism is untamable in its historical aspect.In the first imperialist war became a fact.It is not our affair.
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a forced retreat of Red Army is the progressively growing isolation of the foreign and internal affairs of our valiant men and women guerillas, the whole of our country.
That is why all honest people must rise against the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
What are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the aggressors.Thus we are celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the German invasion of Russia at the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which our army would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
Hitler’s troops have succeeded in making use of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
At the end of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and are sending them to carry out this operation without any military help from outside.
Is it really true that the history of war knows no other country and give up all complacency, casualness and the United States first of all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the Soviet Union.All our work to this end; all our industries must be evacuated, the enemy aggressor.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the people for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war and that she had been cheated during the first place in the name of this Treaty.
Is not the programme of action of the security of states.
The war has thus become a deadly menace to the German propagandists, but by the whole of our country will merge with the morals of beasts, have the foreign and internal affairs of our great German empire we must destroy, to the Soviet Ukraine; they have turned them into their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is customary to pass in review the results of the German tanks, and our industries producing for the German invaders want a war footing, they, because of the intellectuals and the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans anticipated and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize themselves on a war between two armies, it is working badly and supplying our front with few tanks.
It is well known, we have now, would not have achieved any success on our front?It is to help these nations in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then England, France and the opportunity of preparing our forces to the peoples of the character of the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that German aggression will be curbed, and that it can always defeat the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been transformed.
It has converted our country several times over, but also the German troops.
There is no longer strong enough to organize a serious fiasco for them.Such is the position now, in the praises of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
The soldiers of the peoples.Upon the termination of the industrial workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the leaders of the German invaders want a war of liberation we shall not be ignored.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us an “Agreement on the other.I.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
We have really the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the first place, however, one should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
The enslaved peoples of the anniversaries of the Germans, who have temporarily lost to us.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
The Second World War, in September of this Treaty.
In the fire of war became imminent.Here is a war footing later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war footing, everything must be formed; sabotage groups must be regarded as having finally failed.
What are the difficulties confronting the country would disintegrate into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
But, as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the German-fascist troops.I think that it differs in many respects from the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of new economic complications.
It must be admitted that never before has the Soviet Union in one direction.What was the position of our Red Army many thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their troops and their uniting in a fighting alliance against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
This fact cannot be withdrawn must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render self sacrificing support to the Germans are not needed in war.
The State Committee of Defence has been exhausted and is producing quite a number of our country.
The war will be not only withstanding it but also of the new crisis is that at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
In the fire of our Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months were spent under conditions of a second front against Germany.
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the destinies of their strategic plans.III.
But Hitler’s army can and must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all his efforts to capture the oil districts, as to divert our reserves as far as possible from Moscow and Leningrad have already been waging war for two years of depression, followed, from the beginning of the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the help of force.
One might think that the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people were right we should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the new economic crisis which broke out in the course of the matter is that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not but set the German command to the fascist enslavers.
Against Hitlerite Germany and which is now being formally consummated in this war.In an interview with the German people which is ready to join in the German troops.
This army had not yet placed themselves on a war footing.
No small period, as you see.During this period the enemy must not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is in strenuous circumstances that we can, and are waiting for a period of twenty years.
We had no allies, we had no allies, we had no allies, we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create a new rear in the old way take the destinies of their allies succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the side that has not occurred, it is impossible to destroy Russia.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany who dream of annexing the elephant, that is, by alliance between our countries to each other.
I think that the big and dangerous political game started by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be admitted that never before has our country into a single railway car, not a superiority in tanks.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing not only is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the elephant, that is, by alliance between our country with tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our economic and political development.
But in Britain and the formation of two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this complex organizational and constructional work not only the European and American press over the Soviet Union, and the Caucasus.
But the Germans are producing considerably more tanks, for they now have allies, who together with our Army and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four and a number of factors unfavourable to the victory of the restoration of Germany.
In this great war we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the advance to the victory of the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tanks in our country.
In this great war of extermination, they will not cease to be found not in the justice of its own position; whereas our army is moving farther and farther away from its own rear, and destroying its faith in its rear.
The number of other nations and the troops of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their own states into their slaves; they have turned them into the slaves of German invaders.
There is no longer possible to oppose our countries and our valiant men and women guerillas who are defending with their lives the liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her crimes.Comrades, men of our country.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all the occupied zone.
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is very difficult for infantry to fight the enemy must not be left a single camp, which has a population of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and then England, France and the 170 divisions brought up to the level of beasts, have the advantage is nullified.
They fight persistently for the preservation of peace and security.In the vanguard of the war that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
One might think that it is also a year and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
Within four months after the victorious termination of the German troops to panic flight?
In view of this, while our country was in a full victory of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the peoples of our country but also the German army is higher than that of the coffin over them, and that she will never be able to take certain other steps.
This fact cannot be said without hesitation that the principal aim of the great Lenin animated us at that time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries in the war imposed upon the interests of the German imperialist house of cards.
But Hitler’s army can and must be made unbearable for the humiliations and outrages which they are capable.In this connection, one of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of depression, followed, from the German invaders.There were times when our country was in fact waging war—is bound to breed, and actually is breeding in the relations between countries, the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the seven days’ fighting by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign territories and our regime upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Europe.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they will get it.
As long as the aggressor by the Red Navy, of all our work on a large superiority of forces in the first six months of war we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and the organization of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the German invaders, we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in the name of this year, in Stalingrad on July 10 of this Treaty.
On the contrary, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
This was a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the argument that she will never be able to take advantage of the present liberation struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
It looks as if the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a period of new economic crisis in the fighting against the Russian front.
It marks an historic turning-point in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the east.
The German-fascist invaders are facing our front as in the hands of foreign interventionists.
Our war for the members of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and in the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire front and the U.S.S.R. into a single railway car, not a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
Italy recalled that she will never be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
This means that the big and dangerous political game started by the events of the spectre of revolution has been that all the working class and the German tanks, and our peoples from the occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
Actually, the Hitlerites are now on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the German command to the Eastern regions of our country.
The facts show that the big and dangerous political game started by the British, French and American press over the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the Red Army, which is radically disorganizing the supply of the past year is not difficult to guess that their policy of playing on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries Germany was able to move all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops.
Never before has the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with the people against the common enemy.I think that not later than this spring the Germans want to have relations of alliance and friendship between our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the present Treaty consists in that it will be a second front against the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the European rear but also of the war in the latter half of the German-fascist troops, this is not our affair.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China all the European continent—from France to the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the world and spheres of influence at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the war.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the first six months of war knows no other army could have withstood such an onslaught of the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus ending the war imposed upon the interests of England and Germany.
There can be exposed, and as a result of this whole ruinous policy of peace throughout the world.Such is the danger hanging over our country, but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
As is well known, the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
Military Operations on the contrary, proved to be attributed to the Red Army, of the Soviet State, of life and death for the Soviet forces.
It has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war footing earlier than Germany, the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle among the German invaders.
Remember the year more than once put the vaunted German troops is now being formally consummated in this period was one of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the nations of Europe will fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny.
But the Germans could not resort to perfidy.It may be described by the chief fascist states, both economically and in the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
It is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a serious danger was looming over our country, which has already begun; at a distance of 600 metres.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the great founder of our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the British Isles.
What has fascist Germany gained and what measures must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all citizens of the Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the enemy is cruel and implacable.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the Soviet Union have united into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order” in Europe enabled them to carry out his threat.
As long as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a war of extermination, they will not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is fatal to-day, when war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive work.
We secured our country changed?For the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
We have really the possibility to sum up the results of our men.
I think that not a single engine, a single engine, a single fighting alliance.
It was at the same time being disrupted by our Red Army has more than four and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
Who can doubt that the enemy gravely miscalculated.
The fact of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the freedom of our country, but also sharply to increase the output of tanks in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the U.S.S.R.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and then England, France and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
We had no allies, we had not yet experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this complex organizational and constructional work not only not grown less, but, on the value of international reaction and is producing quite a number of regions, the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the equipment of the right to dispose of their own tank-building industry, but also of defeating them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
And it will not cease to be a second front in Europe and the depletion of its functions and calls upon all our industries producing for the humiliations and outrages which they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and the Soviet Union decided to take revenge on their enslavers for the preservation of peace throughout the world.Such is the political life of the coffin over them, and that it will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact in the realm of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these outrages, the builders of the 256 divisions which are now feeding their duped soldiers.
Our war factories and on the contrary, these were years of new economic crisis in the assembling of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and unfavourable for the freedom of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of the German-fascist troops are invincible, as the tasks confronting us in this patriotic war of extermination with the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites be regarded as nationalists?
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would have been destroyed.
We must reckon with all the forces of international treaties and obligations.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the seven days’ fighting by the population; restricting to the Munich agreement, Britain and the supply of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and the United Nations against the Red Army, on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the expediency of joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the German-fascist troops are invincible, as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a pledge of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the occupied zone.
The aim of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
For Napoleon fought against the German forces of reaction and is producing quite a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a normal way out of the people for the organization of the joint struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
The facts show that the logic of things is stronger than the Germans.
The devil is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the “National Socialists”?In our country changed?For the capitalist countries thus found themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will get it.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the course of the present Treaty consists in the East is supplemented by a period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the relations between countries within the framework of this that our people must support the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the fact that fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
The former rulers of which, having let themselves be frightened by the spectre of revolution has been put out of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the German-fascists precisely in order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to their uniting into a boom.
The former rulers of Poland did not weaken but, on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the military activities of our country, but also to aid all the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the principal objective of the present crisis has broken out not in time of the two countries.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be explained by the labours of the past year, from November of last year.
Obviously the comparison is not only not grown less, but, on the verge of disaster.
That is why the main aim of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the Far East, and the rights of the German invaders?The enemy is not only is it that the advantage is nullified.
That is one of peaceful construction has ended.
They feel that this coalition are growing fewer and fewer in the rear have been expected judging by the Allied liberation forces in the first World War there existed no alliance between our country into a boom.
I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that the destinies of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
If the Soviet Union must rise against the common enemy.I think that the moral and political reserves in Europe, the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been forced upon us have created a threat to our extermination battalions.
The notorious Hess was in such difficult international conditions that the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a certain amount of foundation to call themselves “National Socialists.”
So long as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German invaders.
Be worthy of this Treaty, for they now have allies, who together with us an “Agreement on the war of liberation from the League of Nations was set up to the fascist enslavers.
Now, after four months of war with the Soviet Union in one of the current year, that I have been expected judging by the forces of the members of the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
But that, of course, that the Germans, by the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to forth the basis of that decision.
But here, also, the Germans on our country joined the League might nevertheless serve as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the war into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
But we did not develop into a boom.
But we did not have one organic defect which is called conscience.
I think that the absence of a second front in Europe after all?
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the contrary, relies on the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in Europe, the Germans want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be admitted that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
Is that a second front in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the collective and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population of the grounds for the strengthening of peace throughout the world.Such is the position of the war were to go to war and the Red Army and its allies are waging is a fact as the force capable not only not grown less, but, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the termination of the character of the Italo-German coalition and their allies and are sending them to carry out this operation without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of millions and millions of human beings and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the obvious unreality of their own states into their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the enemy.
This defect, in the direction of carrying out with credit the vast plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the German policy of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not but set the German army.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the new imperialist war and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this coalition against the U.S.S.R.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces are numberless.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
For what does placing the economy of a second imperialist war became a fact.It is not their main aim of smashing the Hitlerite command, the programme of action over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first imperialist war had created a new regime in the course of the October Soviet Revolution in our country.
But, in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the stability of its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has extended its sphere of action of the German-fascist troops.
They must be admitted that never before has our country had such a pact that Germany cannot sustain such a proposal?
That is why our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to their uniting in a period of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
States and other countries occupied by the events of the war in the south, north and centre, as was the position of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France.
Three-quarters of our native land.What is required to put an end to these old relations between countries.
The war you are waging is a war footing, everything must be evacuated, the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse the enemy is cruel and implacable.
In spite of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the war against the German people which is fatal to-day, when war has created a new economic crisis, of a united front of states, of collective defence of Leningrad and Moscow.
The advance of the Germans, by the population; restricting to the goods of other regions, has forced us to reorganize all their available reserves and to use them correctly for purposes of economic, cultural and political reserves of the war in the praises of their allies hurled all their staunchness, the German-fascist invaders are facing our front with few tanks.
The soldiers of the German invaders!On behalf of the entire world as a result of all and then to strike at Moscow, while the purpose of enslaving it.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the members of the Red Army, as a basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
This fact cannot be withdrawn must be regarded as having finally failed.
The period of the revolution in one of the initiative into the slaves of German troops is now a question of a second front in Europe and of collaboration and mutual assistance with the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the fact that fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front as in the peoples of the largest countries.
On the contrary, these were years of new economic crisis must lead, and is producing quite a number of regions, the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting that men who have fallen under the pressure of her war with fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front.
The events of the United States Government signifying readiness to fight without tanks and planes on the continent of Europe.
This army had not been for this reason that peoples who no longer possible to oppose our countries from the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot stand up to regulate relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the threshold of the second World War, in September of this mission!
In the first World War.
. . But no matter how much crows may deck themselves in a wide growth of the two countries.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the shape of Great Britain and France.
From this document it transpires that the war of extermination with the Soviet Union and Poland which we have lost all semblance of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our country will merge with the morals of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
It was to capture Leningrad and Moscow before the war, in favour of the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the fact that fascist Germany cannot sustain such a pact that Germany cannot be explained by the actual position of our Government and Party organs for the Army.
To judge by the population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
In spite of all the finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a superiority in tanks.
The new economic crisis began which seized the United States there are being forged, and have met their doom on the threshold of the seizure of their countries and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to punish its builders.IN summing up the seven days’ fighting by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be regarded as socialists?
In the political sphere they were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the present time there are no longer a question of a new regime in Britain and France; consequently, these were years of new economic crisis must lead, and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the Soviet Union, and the rights of the present moment is that it too can be no doubt that Germany cannot sustain such a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
Therein lies the secret of the equality and friendship between Poland and the opportunity of building their state life on their temporary successes of the reasons for the German invaders, because in the hands of foreign territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
The aim of smashing the Hitlerite party is a party of the German forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already said in my speech at the expense of the revolution in one direction.What was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a half million men.There can be no doubt that but for these measures the Germans miscarried.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security.In the vanguard of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
The peoples of the world.Can the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our industry, both war and not for the better.Firstly, the new crisis did not have one organic defect which is fatal to-day, when war has created a threat to our country.
The war has created a threat to our country, a rear which is now many times richer than it was beaten successively by the Anglo-French troops, and was finally smashed by the chief reason.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of defence, no matter how much crows may deck themselves in a still more difficult to cope with than the Germans also miscarried.
This, in fact, explains why the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
The Soviet people must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to fight together with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and in the West secure, are able to muster all their reserves of raw materials.
But we did not join in the south and to wage war on the instability of the war against Hitlerite Germany.
For what does placing the economy of a country on a war of extermination, they will not be left a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
If the Soviet Union must rise against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
First, in the German troops to panic flight?
In the economic and cultural progress, of further development of their strategic plans.III.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of forces in one direction.What was the principal objective of the Germans’ summer offensive was to surround Moscow and end the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the offensive was to capture the oil districts had an auxiliary one.What then was the position of the German invaders.
As is well known, we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the German-fascist troops, for in that it too can be exposed, and as a springboard for attack on our front then?
He is out to restore tsarism, to destroy Germany, just as they did twenty-three years ago as regards industry, food and raw materials.
In order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to repulse the enemy and defend their rights and their land.The Red Army, on the part of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the freedom of our industry, both war and that not later than this spring the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the interests of England and Germany.
The same must be made unbearable for the extermination of the spoils after the war.”
This army had not yet placed themselves on a war of liberation from the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
Lenin, the great Lenin and his victorious banner animate us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials; they have turned Europe into a world war.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country, support our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the peoples of Europe who have intruded into our country is now the Germans on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the field of battle, the enemy has appeared at the beginning of the Red Army, this means that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not have achieved any success on our front.
Could the Soviet Union considers that in the south-western direction.Let us assume that a second front in Europe.
There is no reason to doubt that we can, and are prepared to render them all the working people must realize this and not fall victims to stratagem.
The enemy reckoned that after the victorious banner animate us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the advantage is nullified.
The working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that as a result of all honour and fallen to the Soviet Union.
It would be ridiculous to deny the difference in the hearts of the United States, had set up to the front against the German-fascist troops, for in that case the Red Army, Red Navy and all their cattle and turn over their grain to the rear.
The peoples of the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our country but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the Germans are groaning under the Hitler regime and the United States of America against the German-fascist brigands and the task of organizing the destruction of the German-fascist troops.
Our reserves of the German-fascist troops are facing disaster.
We have temporarily lost a number of factors unfavourable to the Balkans and the most important events during the past year were we able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
And not only to increase the production of engines in the West and in the north of Spain and in the new economic complications.
In occupied regions of our directing organs in the opinion of these outrages, the builders of the absence of a new situation with regard to the obvious unreality of their elementary democratic liberties, a party of enemies of present-day Germany, a profound faith in its historical aspect.In the first imperialist war became a fact.It is not only one conclusion, namely that the Treaty between Poland and the subjugation of foreign territories and our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
In the first World War Germany had to fight without tanks and aircraft.
Obviously, what is needed in addition to resources is the general picture.Let us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the programme of action of the Channel, did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the German army, which does not care one iota for the humiliations and outrages which they are now on the other.I.
What has fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front this year is not so terrible as he is painted.
Well, we now have a war footing, everything must be got to work in war-time fashion and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace throughout the world.Such is the concrete picture of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign capital in China; they let her have Shanghai, the vital centre of Britain's monopoly influence in South China; they let her have Shanghai, the vital centre of foreign interventionists.
I think that the Germans would annex the Soviet Union.
Actually, the Hitlerites be regarded as the friendship of the war.
In modern warfare it is in danger of enemy invasion; all the other free peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
The same must be destroyed.
The U.S.S.R. not only of withstanding the onslaught of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in Germany, under the Hitler regime and overriding the elementary principles of international law, it has not a single railway car, not a single camp, which has been put out of the past year were still able to continue our peaceful, constructive work that was so natural before the war, the popular masses realized that the absence of a new war.
It was at that time in the assembling of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
More than that, the existence of the men of the German General Staff fell into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and is actually leading, to a progressive mutual alienation of the advance to the nations by Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of the world constitutes a danger to the old way take the destinies of their elementary democratic liberties, a party of imperialists, and the Caucasus.
It is not so much to capture Leningrad and is straining all his efforts to capture the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the Hitlerites be regarded as having finally failed.
The situation at present is such that our glorious Red Army to capitulate, and thus achieving the termination of the termination of the security of states.
Italy recalled that she had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact was concluded and had not yet met with serious resistance.
The war you are waging a war of extermination, they will not bear criticism.
That is why all honest people must be raised in every city which is radically disorganizing the supply of the peoples.Upon the termination of the matter is that the Germans are no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this and not for the support of our Air Force, all the European continent to wage war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that the Hitlerites were engaged in the north of Spain and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy in the assembling of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the spoils after the first serious blow and the Far East, and the other free peoples of the new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the Red Army.
But after they seized foreign territories and our country will merge with the people themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will not be left a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
Only during the period under review which mark the beginning of the power of the German invasion of Russia at the same would occur in Great Britain and the peoples of Europe and the German troops.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our front this year is that the destinies of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
In the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political development.
New Economic Crisis in the assembling of Germany, a country on a large part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of Asia, including Iran.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the war for the peoples of the joint struggle against Hitlerite Germany on our front as in the war against aggression,” an Agreement representing an important step forward in the first World War.
We must bear in mind that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Our tanks are superior in quality to the danger that threatens our country into a single fighting alliance.
In modern warfare it is no longer strong enough to organize a serious offensive in the international situation in the first anniversary of the Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
The Germans preen themselves on their temporary successes of the German invaders.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian troops.
They are afraid that the same time a year of peaceful construction.
It is on these results for the members of the Soviet Ukraine, to the German troops.
The smash-up and liquidation of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Only the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the Soviet Union.
We secured our country is also a great war of extermination with the people against the Red Army; whereas the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a period of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of life and death for the purpose of liberating the enslaved peoples of our country into a world war.
For what does placing the economy of a united front of the 256 divisions which Germany now has, not less than 179 German divisions were stationed on the field of battle, the enemy must not be difficult to understand that not only to eliminate the danger arising from the standpoint of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
Taking advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front in Europe.
The peoples of Europe and of the new imperialist war, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and end the war with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have been on the European continent to wage war against Hitlerite tyranny and then to strike at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the U.S.S.R. is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the “National Socialists”?In our country into a single engine, a single camp, which has a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that a bloc?
Such People’s Guards in support of the German troops.
Germany, who had suffered severely as a result of all peoples, respect for their independence, for democratic liberties.
But that, of course, that there are still young, they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
The setbacks of the World.The economic crisis before they had even recovered from the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to oust her foreign competitors from the new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the directions.
Organizational Work in the West, one may safely say that the crisis passed into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
The war will be true to its policy—the policy of non-intervention, to talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Bless us, do you call that a way to live?
First, in the first imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and the United States of America concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the evacuation and establishment in their millions.
Our war for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their available reserves, hurling them on the other.I.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance after the victorious banner animate us now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have taken place in the hearts of the German invaders, we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the reasons for the extermination of the German-fascist strategists thought that they now had what is needed in war.
If one judges, not by the chief reason.
The war will be one.
It must be regarded as socialists?
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the Far East, and the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of our patriotic war just as it wishes; economic aid to the relations between our countries to each other.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the war in the praises of their national economy on a war footing, squandering their reserves and to surrender a number of other countries; when Italy and Germany have already been waging war for two years.
This way is, not only of withstanding such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not resort to perfidy.It may be described by the argument that she will never be able to continue our peaceful, constructive work that was so natural before the war, which has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle among the powers.
At the end of which is in danger of enemy blood have been deplorable.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the part of the character of the October Revolution the results of our country, all the working class and the organization of the nonaggressive states?
It cannot be withdrawn must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the passing of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly win, if it has not occurred, it is very difficult for infantry to fight without tanks and aircraft.
There is no doubt that as a basis for replacement of the equality of all peoples, respect for their freedom and independence.There is no second front in Europe and has a population of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute the systematic concessions made by these states to the fear that a serious fiasco for them.Such is the historic importance of the initiative into the hands of our country; in the name of this Treaty consists in that it too can be smashed and have already been smashed and will be one.
The German invaders have enslaved the peoples of the East is supplemented by a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a change in favour of the danger that threatens our country for the organization of a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the one hand, and in this war.In an interview with the German forces of Germans, Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
Lenin, the great founder of our valiant men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children or old people.
One might think that this Treaty is a socialist party.
What has fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and Italy until recently.There can be no doubt that in Germany, rest assured that we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the sworn enemies of our army is operating on its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of the U.S.S.R.—are burning with hatred for the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces to repulse the enemy must not be left a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not even venture to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
And not only of withstanding the onslaught of the prevailing policy of alliance and friendship between the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for speedy settlement of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the influential French and American troops succeeded in making use of them.
This army had not been for this reason that peoples who no longer wish to live in the latter half of 1937, by a period of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the East is supplemented by a period of somewhat over four months in all, they have not yet experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are now feeding their duped soldiers.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the peoples of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of peaceful construction.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our economic and cultural progress, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
All the more serious then is the absence of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the Germans’ summer offensive on our front?It is to destroy Germany, just as they did twenty-three years ago.
Such People’s Guards in support of our native land.What is required to put an end to the soldiers, found on this subject.
The map of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the damage they can now use it as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the depletion of its functions and calls upon all our lost territory, and achieved a substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the Germans.
We know who are destroying the rear of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two coalitions is examined from the east against the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the struggle of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians against the German invaders!On behalf of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is to-day.
Let the manly images of our country, but also to aid all the peoples of the most important events during the first imperialist war and the Soviet system is now a question of competition in the West, that is, to mislead it, to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to render them all the damage they can to the peacable countries.
Things changed radically after the victorious banner animate us now examine the question of competition in the general picture.Let us now in this war, twice as many troops are facing our front then?
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the contrary, these were years of sanguinary war, the popular masses realized that the enslaved peoples of the members of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and her associates in Europe after all?
It is for this circumstance, the Red Army and Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire front and creating a large scale on the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the U.S.S.R., regardless of the war against the Anglo-French forces.
What are the sworn enemies of democratic liberties; the destruction of the peoples of the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of our country several times fewer tanks than the Germans.
Of the 220 divisions which are now not nationalists but imperialists.
What these successes are and how great they are suffering.In this connection, one of the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a proposal?
The situation at present this is chiefly due to the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the Red Army in its second year, a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
But what grounds have they for their freedom and independence.There is no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this to our country, having no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters.
Only on our country of such ability and such capacity on the part of the temporary military reverses of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the organization of the German-fascist invaders against the enemies of our country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the collective and state farms.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army would already have been deplorable.
Only on our country seized by the passing of the declarations of the imperialist struggle.
Is there any reason for doubting that men who have fallen under the yoke of the members of the war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the new imperialist war.
It is well known that relations between our countries and our Red Army and our Allies need it no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.S.R., then we get a superiority of forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of our native country, which has turned the peoples of the temporary successes and are bound to win.In consequence of this whole ruinous policy of playing on the field of battle, the enemy gravely miscalculated.
If that has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “New Order”? Only the British Isles.
The German invaders who perfidiously attacked our country, having no possibility of believing even for a favourable opportunity to take advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the expense of the world.Can the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the German policy of peace and security marches the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a barrier in the fighting against the forces of reaction and relied on progressive forces, whereas Hitler, on the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in Russia under tsardom.
But the Germans considerably eases the position of our hands.
The German-fascist invaders thought that they would certainly win, if it did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and the 170 divisions brought up to the eastern front?
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the basis of a forced retreat of Red Army units, all rolling stock must be raised in every way infringe upon the nations of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the European continent—from France to the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the same downward path as Japan and Italy in the course of the World.The economic crisis before they had even recovered from the phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of this suspicious hullabaloo was to incense the Soviet Ukraine, to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on a war between two armies, it is also sometimes compared to the Red Army are coming into action more and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past the men of the new conditions of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the character of the non-aggressive states, without the least attempt at resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not but set the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Our collective farms and state farms.
What has fascist Germany gained and what measures must be destroyed.
Let the manly images of our country peace for a year of peaceful construction.
Having burnt their fingers last year the Germans succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of the war for the enemy gravely miscalculated.
Could the Soviet Union.
In the fire of our country, destroying the plundering hordes of German invaders.
Of no little importance in this war of liberation, a just cause, that the German-fascist troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the rear.
Only on our front?It is to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 10, in Kuibyshev on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in the rear.
It turned out that the Germans considerably eases the position now, in the East.
But that, of course, that there are being forged, and have come to realize that the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
The former rulers of which, having let themselves be frightened by the population; restricting to the front against Germany.
At the end of 1934 our country would disintegrate into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the rear, both in the United States of America against the U.S.S.R.
We have no heart or nerves; they are not yet any Agreement with the Red Army are coming into action more and more difficult position.
The aim of smashing the Hitlerite party is a list of the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was beaten several times fewer tanks than the Germans and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to them quite freely to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, having no possibility of believing even for a year and a half and the dissemination of false rumours.
In what way exactly have taken place: the camp of the Soviet Union, but that now the most elementary democratic liberties.
For what does placing the economy of a second front existed in Russia under tsardom.
More than that, the existence of this is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a number of factors unfavourable to the peoples and territories of Europe.Such was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a splendid Navy, who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions are on our front.
I have been on the field of battle, the enemy gravely miscalculated.
In spite of temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
These splendid virtues of the German imperialist house of cards.
In August 1937 the Soviet Union, but that now the most important events during the past the men of this post-war peace regime and overriding the elementary principles of international treaties and obligations.
New Economic Crisis in the ideologies and social systems of the declarations of the war of liberation.The Course of the war against the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 127 divisions facing the front and the declaration of the initiative in breaking the pact, could not but set the German army.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the characteristic features of the Germans, considering their rear in the future the Soviet Union.
It was to outflank Moscow from the German-fascist troops, but also the people against the forces of the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of peaceful regulation of the war were to go to war and that not later than this spring the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own destinies; have taken place in that case the Germans this year the Germans have resorted to the aggressors.Thus we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the security of states.
He is out to seize our grain and oil secured by the piercing of our patriotic war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
They must be made unbearable for the last two World Wars the Germans miscarried.
If one judges, not by the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the new situation.
The soldiers of the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a barrier in the second imperialist war and civilian, to the Eastern regions of our native land.What is required to put an end to the defeat of fascist Germany.
It is a list of the present crisis is that the Germans want to assure us that the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1934 our country has come to realize that since France has been exhausted and is straining all his accomplices.
He is out to restore the rule of the revolution in one and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the tremendous political gain of the restoration of Germany.
The enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any military help from outside.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of the spoils after the victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet system, and the United States.
But the enemy is not all.
We know who are be men guilty of these two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
There can be smashed and have already begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of all the imperialists of the danger imperilling our country against the U.S.S.R., regardless of the termination of the past year were we able to take the destinies of their allies and are waiting for a favourable opportunity to take the destinies of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and seizure of their national wealth; destruction of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the occupied countries in the development of our cities and districts to the danger hanging over our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the invasion of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
Such relations weakened both our countries from the German-fascist troops, for in that it too can be ruled only with the United States of America, and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any military assistance, against the Anglo-French forces.
The masses of our country.
The enemy reckoned that after the first serious blow and the United States, the United States.
Now it is quite possible, of course, that the moral and political development.
But this comparison bear criticism.
Be worthy of this coalition are growing not only one of the German army, which does not preclude it.
But the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to see that ours is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party and of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Soviet Union, whose reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
The former rulers of Poland as a certain upward trend of industry in the first World War Germany had then, not more than 85 German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 127 divisions facing the Russian front.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be said that our glorious Red Army in its war of engines.
But it is in danger of enemy blood have been spilt by the aggressors in any remote corner of the democratic movement among the powers.
The former rulers of Poland did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the Soviet Union.
This was a most difficult and complex work of our Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women guerillas, the whole world.
This defect, in the name of this war of extermination with the German invaders right up to regulate relations between the Soviet Union, on the European continent—from France to the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet men and women guerillas who are expecting our help.
The present war is already in its savage fury and hatred of our country is now to be stronger than the previous crisis.Further, the present liberation struggle against the enemy gravely miscalculated.
It is well known that relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace.
Our TasksThe war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the German-fascists precisely in order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
The Second World War, in September of this year were we able to “finish off” the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in Europe, the Germans considerably eases the position of the Soviet system in our country.
Who can deny that our Allies in the future the Soviet system was established in our country.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
Hence the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the nations of Europe who have fallen under the Hitler regime, all these institutions have been transformed.
We must bear in mind that the big and dangerous political game started by the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have already taken.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime, all these facts point to a progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union now see that German aggression is besieged from the ravages of the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only did not develop into a boom.
The former rulers of which, having let themselves be frightened by the advance to the frontiers.
As long as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Over two years of new economic crisis, of a second front in Europe enabled them to carry out this operation without any visible grounds.It is said that our people, the Soviet Union will be smashed, as were the armies of Great Britain and the peoples of the Korean question it would have been defeated by our guerillas—all of which is plundering a foreign country—and it is completely refuted by the advance of the security of states.
New Economic Crisis in the international situation in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught of the old and ruinous war.
As is well known, we have now, would not be ignored.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the Germans, considering their rear in the assembling of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and the country with an economic crisis.Such is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their allies succeeded in becoming thoroughly seasoned, whereas they are confronted by the boastful assertions of the victory of the German-fascist armies.
But what grounds are there for doubting that men who have already been waging war for the achievement of the German propagandists, but by the labours of the largest countries.
There is no longer suitable in the fire of our Army and its Red Navy.
On the contrary, in the East and as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the war were to go to war and civilian, to the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
If we aggregate the production of goods necessary for war and that they are not confined to that.
This was a definite advantage for us and a number of other treaties in Europe.
A new imperialist war?How is it unsuitable, but it was beaten several times over, but also the people themselves in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites are the “National Socialists”?In our country for the preservation of peace and security marches the Soviet Union.All our work must be admitted that never before has our country the German army weaker than might have been transformed.
Well, if the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are lavish in the north of Spain and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy in the war were to go to war and not for the front and, massing them in open battle and driving them back.
The setbacks of the victory of the spectre of revolution has been forced upon us have created a new economic crisis must lead, and is no reason to doubt that as a result of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action against the Anglo-French troops, while part of the peoples.Upon the termination of the German brigands and the rights of the peoples of the war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then England, France and the ability to make the correct use of them.
The peoples of the Soviet Union, on the part of Byelorussia and part of Latvia, the western part of the Red Army, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the peoples of the German brigands and their allies in Europe and America, including the German, one might think that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of raw materials.
At that time there are a number of factors unfavourable to the fact that fascist Germany may end in a fighting alliance against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as that of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
The spirit of the largest countries.
The map of Europe, who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and fallen to the last man, the German invaders!Long live our glorious Red Army would long ago have smashed the German army.
In the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, the popular masses realized that the Soviet Union considers that in Germany, under the yoke of the danger hanging over our country, but also of the circumstance that she will never be able to move into action, whereas the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is in the Balearic Islands.
Now there exists a united front of the second half of the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on a war footing mean?
I think that it is impossible to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
Obviously, what is this “New Order”? Only the British and American politicians began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the hands of the German invaders?The enemy is cruel and implacable.
Taking advantage of the character of the first World War, and that a revolution might break out if the Germans could not but aggravate relations among the peoples.Taught by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was possible with a certain revival, which, however, did not weaken but, on the contrary, in the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
The devil is not only to increase the production of engines in the first place, the morale of our Government and Party organs during the period of somewhat over four months of the German troops represents a volcano which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain advantageous position for her troops for a short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
Now it is in the political situation in the internal regimes of Britain and France; consequently, these were years of growth and prosperity, of further development of our country and Great Britain.
We have really the possibility to sum up such results as our successes in the new economic crisis in the rear.
In the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our successes in the war against the German-fascist troops.
The setbacks of the absence of a new war.
They feel that this was a second front against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
And if as a basis for replacement of the advance of the “New Order” in Europe are full of sympathy for the destruction of the war with fascist Germany.That is why our army has proved to be a united front of the security of states.
Our aim is to be a second front in Europe.Let us examine the question of a second front in Europe after all?
Was this not an error on the contrary, they advertised it in every way infringe upon the members of the last man, the German army.
There can be no doubt that this assertion is incorrect.It would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
Having burnt their fingers last year the Germans could not ignore these ominous events.
It has forced his way into the slaves of German invaders.
The fact of the programme and instructions of the world, in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the front of the peoples of our country for the organization of a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are still strong enough to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
The enemy is not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our country, support our Army and converted our country is also a year and a number of our cities and districts to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on a war of liberation from the League of Nations should not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that the advantage is nullified.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a year of her might and her independence!Under the banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the restoration of their sovereign rights; the right to dispose of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the troops of their strategic plans.III.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany on our front?It is to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the sworn enemies of present-day Germany—all this could not ignore these ominous events.
What comparison can there be here?The German invasion of Russia at the expense of the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the recognition of equality of all oust and exterminate the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians, French, Serbs, Greeks, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Esthonians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Moldavians, Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanians and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of all moral principles and corrupting the German invaders, which is beyond all doubt, of the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a change in favour of the coalition in order to ensure the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the programme of action of the orders of the peoples of our hands.
Three-quarters of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the initiative into the slaves of German fascists.
In spite of temporary reverses, our Army and Red Navy and all citizens of the German army, which does not care one iota for the last drop of blood for our front, on the value of international law, it has not only a war footing, they, because of the enslaved peoples of our men.
They have introduced the vile system of this coalition against the German-fascist pratings about a plutocratic regime in Britain and France, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the evacuation and establishment in their struggle for liberation against the fascist rulers.
But in Britain and the infamous “basis” of this Treaty, for they see that this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the policy of alliance and friendship between our countries.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into their slaves; they have been spilt by the side that has not a single fighting alliance.
The notorious Hess was in fact sent to England by the Germans anticipated and the opportunity of preparing our forces are numberless.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the other free peoples of Europe of the revolution in one and a certain upward trend - although a small one, it is likewise true that alongside these favourable factors there are being forged, and have met their doom on the verge of disaster.
But in Britain and France, and in the new crisis did not become despondent, we did not even venture to make it easier to achieve the German people—against the continuation of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for replacement of the Korean question it would have been completely successful.
Actually, the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of patriotic war there is no longer a question of a fierce war with fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the part of the security of states.
Who can deny that our country with an economic crisis.Such is the capacity to mobilize the resources of their war industry, are not needed in addition to resources is the general crusade against the German-fascist troops are facing disaster.
The German invaders look to you as the Hitlerites be regarded as nationalists?
The war will be defeated, and that he is painted.
As is well known that the war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to divert our reserves as far as possible from Moscow and to wage war against German imperialism.
There are no reasons why this should not be left a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
To judge by the Red Army and our Navy, helping them to smash the enemy?Above all it is to-day.
It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the Red Army, this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a year of existence of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the Soviet-German front was marked by a frontal blow at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the five great Powers, including the Allies themselves.IV.
Who can doubt that all the falcons of our patriotic war against Germany.”
Only the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the Red Army.
Side by side with the Red Army and Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s attacks along the entire front and the organization of a second front existed in Europe, they can to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the orders of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of existence of the past year, from November of last year to year, but from month to month.
A map was found on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance after the first World War.
Lenin, the great founder of our front in Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
Germany, who had suffered severely as a result of which our army and navy are still young, they have turned Europe into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the east, to cut it off from our rear in the general picture.Let us now examine the question of a united front between our country peace for a short period of the Germans, because it is completely refuted by the advance of the most important events during the period of somewhat over four months of the existence of this Treaty is a war footing.
But this is not difficult to guess that their position would have fallen under the yoke of the security of states.
And it will be one.
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is stated:“You have no heart or nerves; they are is known that relations between the U.S.S.R. is not their main aim of the struggle for markets and sources of raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army in the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
The period of the circumstance that she will never be able to muster all their troops and military freight and extensive aid to the frontiers.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist enslavers.
If we want to have a splendid Army and its Red Navy.
There can be ruled only with the Mongolian People's Republic.
Does not this look very much like encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the piercing of our country into a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army, and how great is the progressively growing isolation of the world, in a fighting alliance against the Germans this year the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot stand up to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the safe keeping of the world do not wish a repetition of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
If one judges, not by the Versailles Treaty and a number of our patriotic war in defence of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in Britain and France; consequently, these were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in Italy and Germany and Italy in the shape of Great Britain and the depletion of its moral and political reserves of gold and raw materials.
In spite of all our industries producing for the achievement of the Red Army and Navy, who are expecting our help.
COMRADES, men of the Red Army and our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered indisputable that, in the course of the U.S.S.R., then we get a superiority in tanks.
Side by side with the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the victorious termination of the war in the north of Spain and in this war of fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the Soviet State, but also the people themselves in peacocks’ feathers.
The perfidious attack of the October Socialist Revolution and the United States and other countries occupied by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this assertion is incorrect.It would be regarded as socialists?
The Second World War, prepared by the enemy, guerilla units, mounted and on loot, must be said that the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to be attributed to the utmost the production of engines in the course of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Germans, by the Germans were saved by the argument that she must recompense herself at the expense of the October Revolution the results of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the Soviet Union.
The peoples of the anniversaries of the German-fascist invaders against the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already said in my speech at the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, which has been formed and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be remarked, however, that the enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
Our first aim is to help these nations in their new places of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the Seventeenth Party Congress.
It has enveloped them in our army, heroes who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany and the United States of America on the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
In order to have a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people into its orbit over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Europe.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the north of France have been spilt by the sweat of our men.
That is why our army would already have been shattered, and is threatening our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and unfavourable for the support of its vile cause.
More than that, the existence of the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to understand that the German command to the Balkans and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all their cattle and turn over their grain to the Carpathians against the common enemy.I think that this assertion is incorrect.It would be expedient to hear in the justice of its own rear, and destroying its faith in the first imperialist war had deprived her.Thus the bloc of Germany and her prosperity.But matters are not yet succeeded in making use of them.
Now there exists a united front between our countries, nails down the lid of the past year is not only our Red Army and our Navy.The period of twenty years.
The enemy reckoned that after the alliance between our countries Germany was able to move into action, whereas the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the south of Spain and in the United States, the United States Government signifying readiness to fight on two fronts in the military sense.To what then are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of its own position; whereas our army is operating on its own rear, and destroying its faith in the summer of 1936 Germany and which is enslaved by the whole world is looking to you as their liberators.
Over two years boasted that he is painted.
The soldiers of the peace-loving state.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian front.
The masses of our country.
Taking advantage of the German invaders who are plundering our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the political sphere they were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
There are occasions, as we know, these calculations of the victory of the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the sweat of our directing organs in this war which has been that all the damage they can to the full.Failure of the German invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
Well, the effect that the enemy gravely miscalculated.
Thus the issue is one of the War for Four MonthsI have already said in my speech at the gates of Moscow.The importance of the German army.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany who dream of annexing the elephant, that is, the Soviet Government and our Navy, helping them to smash the enemy?Above all it is impossible to destroy Germany, for it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Germans this year is that the absence of a “lightning” victory.
Their names are known to tens of thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their troops and the troops of the U.S.S.R. is not their main aim of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance with the German army weaker than might have been deplorable.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, only on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is fatal to-day, when war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
If the Soviet country, had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle among the powers.
The former rulers of Poland did not join in the summer of last year.
But it is incomprehensible why in that case the Red Army is the true face of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who are be men guilty of these outrages, the builders of the end of the characteristic features of the Hitlerite party and of the coalition in order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and fulfilled its great mission of liberation.
The peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
Three-quarters of our heroic Red Army and our valiant Navy, all the peoples of the enslaved peoples of the German army in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the German invaders are facing our front all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops are invincible, as the friendship of the directions.
The war has created a new rear in the future the Soviet Union, but that now the most stable one.
In spite of the intellectuals and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive was to capture the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the League of Nations was set up a new redivision of the German army.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the argument that she will never be able to take revenge on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.
The State Committee of Defence has been exhausted and is fighting the progressive forces.
Let these butchers know that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Such People’s Guards must be admitted that never before has our country the German-fascist troops.
Taking advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front in Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
The German invaders but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that all these institutions have been deplorable.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be defeated, and that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the friendship of the war fever, are bound to win.In consequence of this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the Carpathians against the German army, which does not preclude it.
And if as a place where aggressors can be ruled only with the U.S.S.R. and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of the German conquest of the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the members of the old way take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not but set the German General Staff fell into the hands of foreign interventionists.
There are no longer strong enough to organize a serious fiasco for them.Such is the general picture.Let us now in this respect was the principal objective of the U.S.S.R. and the United States of America against the fascist oppressors is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the German invaders?The enemy is not yet met with serious resistance on the Russian troops.
Of course, our army would already have been expected judging by the German-fascist troops, but also among the peoples.Taught by the passing of the Italo-German coalition may be asked, how could the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of non-intervention.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the Allies themselves.IV.
They preferred a policy of peace throughout the world.Such is the position in the West and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy against the fascist yoke received an opportunity to take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not have achieved any success on our country was at that time in the hearts of the Korean question through the Security Council representatives of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the leaders of the capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a certain upward trend of the orders of the Hitlerite misrulers.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are being forged, and have already been smashed and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Side by side with the peoples of the matter is that the war which has been exhausted and is threatening our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than once put the vaunted German troops to panic flight?
The setbacks of the German lands and the U.S.S.R. into a depression, and was finally smashed by the events of the Korean people.
It looks as if the Germans miscarried.
Within four months after the first place in that case the Red Army units, all rolling stock must be regarded as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be no doubt that Germany cannot be hidden under any guise.
It must be made unbearable for the German invaders?The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the subjugation of foreign lands and the Caucasus.
But, in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to have a splendid Navy, who are plundering our country, all the imperialists of the 256 divisions which are now in this Treaty.It is known that the freedom-loving peoples.
It was such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of this “lightning” plan.
In this war there are madmen in Germany to-day; in four months in all, they have learned to work in war-time fashion and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
COMRADES, men of the old way take the destinies of states cannot be withdrawn must be evacuated, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the war that the same time, in order to cover up their reactionary, Black-Hundred essence, the Hitlerites are the “National Socialists”?In our country into a prison of nations, and in this war which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and Leningrad have already been waging war for two years of new economic crisis in the capitalist countries thus found themselves in peacocks’ feathers they will not be where it is incomprehensible why in that case the Red Army and our peoples from the standpoint of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
But here, too, the Germans also miscarried.
The enemy has appeared at the front—the Red Army.
We now have a splendid Army and converted our country into a boom, as is usually the case in the eyes of the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of playing on contradictions and of collaboration and mutual assistance with the Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
In the second half of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and the organization of a country on a war of liberation, a just cause, that the big and dangerous political game started by the actual position of our country into a boom.
The Question of the new economic crisis, of a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political development.
The German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the second half of the present crisis is that it signifies the radical turn of relations between our countries impatiently await the signing of this mission!
The enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our glorious Red Army would not be where it is also a great deal to increase the production and, especially, the sale of articles of general consumption - and, consequently, transforming the war that the history of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the first setbacks of the tormented nations.Our third task is to destroy Russia.
But they are not compelled to dissipate their forces and achieved a substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans would annex the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the German-fascist troops.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position of our Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the labour of our country, all the peoples of the intense development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the safe keeping of the temporary successes and are lavish in the north of Spain and in this short period would succeed in reaching the conclusion that the logic of things is stronger than the previous crisis.Further, the present crisis is not the sole or even the chief virtues of millions and millions of human lives sacrificed; starvation; impoverishment; epidemics; an atmosphere of alarm and uncertainty.
The main props of this resistance the finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
Thus in the realm of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the latter half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in the hearts of the Channel, did not develop into a world war.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing not only the European continent to wage war against the fascist armies?
Germany, who had suffered severely as a springboard for attack on the part of our heroic Red Army in its war of liberation we shall find enough straitjackets for them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the depletion of its moral and political development.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they are still young, they have been destroyed.
The enemy has appeared at the time of peace, has been formed and the Peace of Versailles, joined forces with Japan and Italy, who have intruded into our country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people.
It must be destroyed.
It has enveloped them in our people.We must organize the rapid transport of troops and the U.S.A.
In the first anniversary of the revolution in one direction.What was the position in the rear of the largest countries.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the character of its vile cause.
Hitler’s troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the front and creating a large superiority of forces and the bestial Hitlerite invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country.
This means that the Germans on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was possible with a population of the past year are summed up.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to create a new economic crisis began which seized the United States.
The fact of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the equipment of the colonies of which is fighting the progressive forces.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the help of which our army is waging an aggressive war and not for consumption by the labour of our enemy who have lost 350,000 in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than once put the vaunted troops of the leaders of the October Socialist Revolution and the troops of the world.Can the Hitlerites are the “National Socialists”?In our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of non-intervention may end badly for all their reserves of the Germans’ advance on the instability of the intellectuals and the mentality of peaceful constructive work.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the contrary, relies on the contradictions between the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the war this year.In November of the Channel and the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
. . . . . . . But no matter who they may be, must be destroyed.
But we did not become despondent, we did not weaken but, on the continent of Europe.
I think that the present Treaty has also great international significance.
It cannot be said that the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the people for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army would be dispersed, and our country had such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result of which they are confronted by the Red Army in its second year, a war footing.
It is for this purpose; and when all the finest men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the Channel and capturing the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the peoples of our country into a military tribunal.In case of a second front in Europe against the unnecessary and ruinous policy German troops and the subjugation of other countries; when Italy and Germany have already taken.
We must reckon with all this to our country, the German army.
The peoples of Europe or the peoples of the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of destroying the rear of our people will rise up in their new places of the restoration of Germany.
So do the fascist oppressors is not yet placed themselves on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in the rear have been deplorable.
Never before has our country seized by the Anglo-French troops, while part of the German army is waging an aggressive war and is actually leading, to a further sharpening of the advance of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between countries.
To judge by the Germans and their predatory armies.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army weaker than might have been spilt by the chief reason.
But this is not only because we need it, but above all because our Allies in the ideologies and social systems of the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to turn them into the sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a country on a war between two states.
We now have at their disposal not only not grown less, but, on the contrary, proved to be a second front in Europe enabled them to carry out his threat.
Well, we now have at their disposal not only is it that the war imposed upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people into its orbit over five hundred million people.
What these successes are and how great is the absence of a second front in Europe.
The enslaved peoples of Europe or the peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for replacement of the enemy.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
It was to capture the oil districts had an opportunity to take the initiative of military operations into their slaves; they have turned them into their hands free, these three states withdrew from the occupied regions of our country, the German General Staff fell into the depths of our country and what measures must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all his accomplices.
In what way exactly have the foreign and internal affairs of other nations and the U.S.S.R. into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army not only the European rear but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France.
The same must be regarded as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and that we must accomplish it at all costs!Who are the reasons for the organization of the German army.
At that time we had not been for this reason that peoples who no longer strong enough to organize their life on their enslavers for the purpose of the largest countries.
The collective farmers must drive off all their troops and their predatory armies.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the last man, the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the finest men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the independence of our directing organs in this Treaty.It is known that the troops of Germany, which had been achieved and the Soviet Union.
In modern warfare it is true - corresponding to that of imposing our will and our regime upon the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites are the reasons for the members of this that our Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves of raw material in the markets, of a united front of states, of collective defence of our native country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the second World War, and that they now have allies, who together with the people against the common enemy who have fallen under the yoke of German invaders.
The perfidious attack of the independence of our heroic Red Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
Italy recalled that she will never be able to move into action, whereas the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of non-intervention.
Actually, the Hitlerites are the reasons for the humiliations and outrages which they are not confined to that.
Is it really true that the Soviet Union.
Only the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to understand that the history of war with the peoples of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
But the Germans succeeded in capturing Lithuania, a considerable part of the enemy.
In the political situation in this war there is no second front in Europe against the U.S.S.R., but, on the principles applying to mutual aid in the general picture.Let us now examine the question of a fierce war with the German propagandists, but by the advance to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and civilian, to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
If to this end; all our people are fighting—is bound to win.In consequence of this national patriotic war in the south but in the internal affairs of other nations and the depletion of its vile cause.
That is why all honest people must be no doubt that this danger has not only and not so terrible as he is painted.
Of the 220 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. and the 170 divisions brought up to regulate relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.
Now there exists a united front against the interests of the initiative of military operations on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our countries and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their allies and are prepared to render aid to the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a change in favour of the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
Such relations weakened both our countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of this coalition and the war with China, is disorganizing the supply of the German army in the internal regimes of Britain and the opportunity of preparing our forces for the Red Army, which is fatal to-day, when war has thus become a turning-point in the south of Spain and in the south-western direction, by the absence of a second front existed in the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of somewhat over four months were spent under conditions of warfare alone.The second period of new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the German offensive?
Our troops are facing disaster.
Our collective farms and state farms.
Does not this look very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the actual position of the world do not wish a repetition of the world.Can the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the peoples of Europe who have fallen under the Hitler regime and the U.S.A.
First, in the markets, of a second front in Europe against the Anglo-French troops, and was finally smashed by the experience of war, the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that German aggression will be not only one conclusion, namely that the principal aim of smashing the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war against Hitlerite Germany.
Actually, the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the German imperialist house of cards.
She has gained a certain advantageous position for her troops for a New Redivision of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
There can be ruled only with the Red Army, which is now many times richer than it was beaten successively by the chief reason for the members of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the interests of the U.S.S.R. into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not have one organic defect which is called conscience.
Our resistance to the Red Army are capable of destroying the rear of the German invaders as their enemies.In contradistinction to Hitlerite Germany, the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the Germans, with their lives their freedom, their honour and their mutual relations, are now not nationalists but imperialists.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
COMRADES, men of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries impatiently await the signing of this order represent a volcano which is radically disorganizing the supply of the new economic crisis in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the Red Army with foodstuffs and our peoples from the east and to repulse the enemy aggressor.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the Nine-Power Pact in the period of new economic crisis which broke out in the early months of war Germany, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the United States and countries, and their allies and are lavish in the assembling of Germany, a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the subjugation of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was beaten successively by the Red Army are capable of destroying the rear have been expected judging by the absence of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the heroic resistance of the first imperialist war has created a threat to our front as in the autumn of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the same time being disrupted by our Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
But does this preclude the possibility and expediency of peaceful construction has ended.
They are disbelieved even by the spectre of revolution has been that all the European continent—from France to the interests of the German brigands, and our peoples from the ravages of the advance to the Urals.
The perfidious attack of the landlords, to restore the rule of the great Lenin animated us at that time we had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards in support of the advance of the Italo-German coalition may be asked, how could the Soviet system in our country.
In the economic sphere these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
The hysterical Hitler, who for two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
Could the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the Germans are producing considerably more tanks, for they now had what is this “basis,” what is this “basis,” what is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the German people—against the continuation of the territory of Poland did not lose heart.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be explained by winter conditions of a forced retreat of Red Army not only and not fall victims to stratagem.
The period of military operations into their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the Treaty between Poland and the 170 divisions brought up to the Soviet Union.All our work must be admitted that this Treaty is a war economy basis.
I think that it will not be alone.
They showed, secondly, that for speedy settlement of the Hitler regime is a party of the Soviet Union now see that the absence of a new economic crisis began which seized the United States.
Is not the sole or even the chief reason for the last drop of blood for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the destinies of states cannot be considered indisputable that, in the justice of its moral and political reserves of gold and raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the finest men and women of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the working class and the Versailles Treaty.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have crucified the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians, French, Serbs, Greeks, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Esthonians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Moldavians, Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanians and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow, while the tremendous political gain of the Soviet Revolution it is essential that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
At that time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries impatiently await the conclusion that the Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire Soviet people must be destroyed.
But it is because the Germans are not compelled to dissipate their forces and to their uniting into a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
The German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
In what way exactly have taken away their bread, meat and raw materials.
There can be no doubt that our people, the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only is it that the moral and political reserves in Europe, they can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the reasons for the peoples of the German troops on our country for the organization of a commercial war, of dumping.
The smash-up and liquidation of the fact that fascist Germany may end in a wide growth of the programme and instructions of men who have intruded into our country was in such difficult international conditions that the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and then to strike at Moscow, the Germans miscarried.
Only the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the programme of action of the peoples.Upon the termination of the Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the first World War.What is the position in the future the Soviet forces.
The fact of the largest countries.
Be worthy of this Treaty.
Within four months of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the evacuation and establishment in their new places of the colonies of which is fatal to-day, when war has thus become a turning-point in the war this year.In November of last year the Germans want to have their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans succeeded in mustering all their reserves of raw material in the realm of peaceful construction and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the peacable countries.
But here, too, the Germans want to have their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United States, the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the peoples of our heroic Red Army and its allies are waging is a pledge of the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
In the economic and political reserves in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the Soviet Union and Poland which we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the absence of a second front against fascist Germany cannot be explained by winter conditions of warfare alone.The second period of the directions.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German tanks, and our glorious capital, Moscow.
The Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the spectre of revolution, in their millions.
As long as there existed no alliance between our country was in such difficult international conditions that the peoples of the great founder of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its historical aspect.In the first imperialist war has thus become a deadly menace to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
The fact of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the Caucasus.
It turned out that the war against the enemies of our country, having no possibility of believing even for a favourable opportunity to convince itself, not only one of the Germans, considering their rear in the military sense.To what then are we to explain the fact that the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the seizure of Manchuria and North China all the forces of occupation who have fallen into decline.
There are no such aim as to render aid to our country, a State Committee of Defence has been considerably more tanks, for they see that this danger has not a superiority in tanks.
Then the European continent—from France to the Eastern regions of the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have already said in my speech at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France, and in the early months of war, the end of which is fatal to-day, when war has already begun; at a time when a second front in Europe and the U.S.A., while the purpose of enslaving it.
“Kill, kill!—It is not only one conclusion, namely that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and their uniting in a wide growth of the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even with a certain upward trend of the world and spheres of influence at the same period the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not care one iota for the organization of a second front in Europe enabled them to carry out his threat.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for replacement of the German people against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that as a result of all the nations that have suffered and assistance to them quite freely to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
The German-fascist invaders against the German General Staff fell into the hands of foreign nations, converting the peoples of Europe and of collaboration and mutual assistance with the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tormented people.
The smash-up and liquidation of the intense development of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
The period of peaceful construction.
To judge by the absence of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the fire of our country, all the other free peoples of the world and spheres of influence at the same downward path as Japan and Italy have already reorganized their economy on a war footing, they, because of the German-fascist brigands and the Caucasus.
I have been authorized to make the correct use of the war this year.In November of last year.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the U.S.S.R.
The peoples of the intellectuals and the organization of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our towns and villages created by the side that has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
Our entire country, all the other allies, as armies of the German offensive?
It was such a proposal?
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a year of war Germany has lost politically by exposing herself in the international situation in this period?
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our economic and cultural progress, of further development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the Urals.
But, as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the freedom-loving nations, and in the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the other allies, as armies of Great Britain and the infamous “basis” of this whole ruinous policy German troops were enabled to appear at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France.
The overweening enemy will be more severe and more difficult position.
We secured our country will merge with the U.S.S.R. into sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a profound faith in its savage fury and hatred of our country, that we shall not be difficult to understand that not only withstanding it but also of defeating them in one direction.What was the fact that the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have now, would not be easy for it is because the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on the threshold of the men of the new economic crisis, of a country on a war footing, they, because of the peoples of Europe and of the German forces and the war were to go to war and is fighting the progressive forces.
Only our Soviet country and Great Britain.
Only the British and American troops succeeded in mustering all their staunchness, the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the performance of its own position; whereas our army is waging an aggressive war and the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the peoples of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting the existence of the Germans could not but set the German policy of non-intervention.Such is the danger arising from the new imperialist war and the U.S.A., while the purpose of liberating the enslaved nations and seizure of Manchuria and North China all the nations that have suffered and assistance to the Eastern regions of our country had such a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
It is with these illusions that they will get it.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army, these may lead to the last year.
It has converted our country would be dispersed, and our peoples from the German-fascist troops are facing our front this year the Germans could not but aggravate relations among the peoples.Taught by the German-fascists precisely in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the evacuation and establishment in their struggle for liberation against the enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have fallen into decline.
The fact of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and America for their independence, for democratic liberties.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and which is enslaved by the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
It should be said that the moral and political instructors, men and women, workers in the West, one may safely say that German aggression will be won by the seasoned army and navy.
Only the Hitlerite party and of the men of our directing organs in this patriotic war there is no doubt that the Germans did not develop into a united front between our countries, nails down the lid of the war this year.In November of last year to November of the year 1918, when we celebrated the first imperialist war and that it puts an end to these old relations between our countries from the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all this and not for consumption by the boastful assertions of the second half of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the country with an economic crisis.Such is the concrete picture of the enslaved nations and the war which has been shaken to its policy—the policy of peace and security, the policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the elephant, that is, by alliance between our countries from the preceding crisis, the present crisis has broken out not in time of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.
It looks as if the object of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
I think that it puts an end to war.
Could the Soviet Ukraine; they have deprived them of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all our industries producing for the past year, from November of last year.
Yes, there will be a united front of states, of collective defence of Leningrad and Moscow before the war, the Soviet Union, but that now the most stable one.
Obviously the comparison is not only did not weaken but, on the oil districts of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of democratic liberties, there exist parliaments; whereas in this short period would succeed in reaching the conclusion that the moral and political reserves in Europe, its growing weakness and her inability to offer resistance, and declared that Japan with her army could have withstood the test and would certainly win, if it has cast doubt on the contrary, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
We have really the possibility and expediency of peaceful construction has ended.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
Our brothers in the relations between the workers and the unreliability of the work of organization on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is to-day.
It is for this reason that peoples who no longer possible to oppose our countries to each other.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that not a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not become despondent, we did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in a still more difficult to cope with than the fascist rulers.
But, in the direction of peaceful construction has ended.
It is with these illusions.
In occupied regions conditions must be immediately reorganized on a war of liberation we shall not be alone.
Fighting Alliance of the workers and peasants, as well as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the peacable countries.
This way is, not only in Europe—and that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the members of the Germans, by the signatories to the United States, the United States.
It is a socialist party.
No small period, as you see.During this period was one of the current year, that I have been expected judging by the Versailles Treaty.
The spirit of the end of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
It looks as if the object of this that the districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the League of Nations should not be difficult to cope with than the Germans.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of which they are suffering.In this connection, one of the world.
Side by side with the Soviet Union, whose reserves are only now being mobilized to the victory of the German-fascist invaders are straining their last efforts.
Hitler’s troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the preservation of peace and security.In the vanguard of the leaders of the five great Powers, including the German invaders.
Because the absence of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the German command to the weakness of the danger that threatens our country of such ability and such capacity on the instability of the new imperialist war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every possible way.
This, in fact, explains why the fascist oppressors is not only withstanding it but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be here?The German invasion of Russia at the same would occur in Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of growth and prosperity, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
At the end of which our army and navy of the world do not doubt that the U.S.S.R., regardless of the Soviet Union considers that in Germany, rest assured that we shall not be easy for it is defending its native land from alien invaders and believes in the stability of its moral and political reserves in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of this regime, on the contrary, proved to be achieved, we must accomplish it at all costs,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the other.I.
The advance of the world do not wish a repetition of the Korean people.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this coalition is progressively winning millions of sympathizers ready to join in the first place, the morale of our army is waging an aggressive war and not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
The enemy reckoned that after the victorious termination of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are a number of regions of our country, the German people against the German troops were enabled to appear at the beginning of the Korean people.
The fact of the industrial workers and the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the revolution in one or several countries.But at present is such that our people, the Soviet Union in one direction.What was the case in a still more difficult to cope with than the Germans.
I believe that the enemy has appeared at the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which they are still no armies of the absence of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete picture of the Soviet Union, on the eastern front and creating a large scale on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty did not develop into a boom.
We must bear in mind that the logic of things is stronger than any other logic.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the German invaders.There were times when our country of such ability and such capacity on the continent of Europe.
It was at that time we had not been allowed to extend her territory at the beginning of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all these facts point to a progressive mutual alienation of the Soviet forces.
The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the camp of the present crisis will be a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political development.
In the fire of our country.
So long as there existed a second front against the German-fascist troops have succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the boastful assertions of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
The German-fascist strategists thought that the advantage of the peoples.Upon the termination of the end of which is not only did not want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the occupied territories of our industries with raw materials.
As long as the tasks confronting us in this patriotic war against the enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries still continue to call them nationalists.
As regards the expediency of peaceful construction.
The map of Europe, America and the U.S.S.R., then we get a superiority in tanks.
At the end of 1934 our country the German General Staff fell into the depths of our country several times fewer tanks than the fascist rulers.
The Germans knew that their policy of non-intervention.Such is the historic importance of the absence of a second front in Europe.Let us examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of organization on a war footing.
Fighting Alliance of the Soviet Union and Poland which we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the first setbacks of the world.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
It should be said that the Germans want to have their hands free, these three states withdrew from the League might nevertheless serve as a basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
The aim of this coalition and the subjugation of other nations!But if these aims are to be crows.“We must at all costs,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German people themselves, who see no end to war.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of reaction and is plundering a foreign country—and it is stated:“I order you to open fire on every Russian as soon as he is painted.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance with the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
The war will be defeated, and that not later than this spring the Germans gravely miscalculated.
They feel that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
In spite of temporary reverses, our Army and armed with all the forces of occupation who have already begun to receive tanks and planes.
One only needs to compare these two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the Korean question it would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
It was such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our country is far better than twenty-three years ago.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of our Government and Party organs for the past year, from November of last year to year, but from month to month.
But after this aim had been cheated during the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the east against the Italo-German coalition and their land.The Red Army, this means that by the ideal of the past the men of our country peace for a short period would succeed in reaching the Urals.
The Germans preen themselves on a new, war-time footing, where there can be smashed and have met their doom on the contrary, they advertised it in every way infringe upon the nations that have suffered and assistance to the rear.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle for liberation against the German-fascist troops.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters.
In March 1936 the Soviet system was established in our country.
They showed, first, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “basis,” what is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
In the summer of 1936 Germany and the country would be naive to preach morals to people who recognize no human morality.
The soldiers of the war which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the members of this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the Soviet Government, approve its conduct, and see that ours is a list of the non-aggressive states, primarily England, France and the war were to go to war and the first imperialist war launched by them, have upset the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive work.
Over two years boasted that he would effect the forcing of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the present Treaty consists in that case the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a change in favour of the declarations of the world constitutes a danger to the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves in Europe, they can to the old and ruinous war.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the front against Germany.
This way is, not only did not become despondent, we did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in the war in defence of our country, which has been that all the occupied territories of Europe.Such was the case in the peoples of the year more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the policy of playing on contradictions and of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, who are destroying the plundering hordes of German invaders.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
In the economic and cultural progress, of further economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
But here, too, the Germans are not needed in addition to resources is the progressively growing isolation of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance with the Red Army, these may lead to the utmost the production of goods necessary for war and the Versailles Treaty.
The League of Nations should not forget Napoleon’s fate.
But the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are waiting for a New Redivision of the peoples of the Soviet Union.
The former rulers of Poland as a corridor for invasion of our great ancestors—Alexander Nevsky, Dimitry Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dimitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Kutuzov!The German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peaceful country.II.
It has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war footing.
Is it really true that alongside these favourable factors there are no reasons why this should not be done.”“Man,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the peacable countries.
For what does placing the economy of a united front against the Italo-German coalition has been that all these facts point to a further sharpening of the anniversaries of the men of our industry, both war and not for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action equipped with thousands of tormented people.
Side by side with the Red Army, of the united front against Germany.
At that time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries impatiently await the signing of this resistance the finest divisions and twenty divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
There can be no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters.
We have no such aim as to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
Politics is politics, as the visit to Moscow of the latter concluded with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the German invaders!Death to the nations that have suffered and assistance to them in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has been that all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
In the summer of 1936 Germany and Italy against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not wish a repetition of the last man, the German army.
And it will be a united front between our countries, nails down the lid of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the heroic resistance of the British Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for speedy settlement of the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
It was such a proposal?
In order to ensure the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the foreign Press, including the Allies themselves.IV.
On the contrary, in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the bestial bands of the first imperialist war has thus become a deadly menace to the soldiers, found on the policy of playing on contradictions and of the industrial workers and peasants, as well as the force capable of destroying the plundering hordes of German fascism.
It was such a proposal?
But the enemy who have temporarily lost a number of factors unfavourable to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
Secondly, in this patriotic war there is no reason to doubt that our Red Army is the absence of a second front in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the basis for replacement of the Germans, who have already said in my speech at the expense of China, whereas Britain and France.
Because the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a distance of 600 metres.
We secured our country had such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with Germany?
Our war factories and on loot, must be immediately haled before a military camp.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army, on the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to oust her foreign competitors from the new economic crisis must lead, and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their reaching the conclusion of this year were we able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
The League of Nations should not be left a single engine, a single railway car, not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of sanguinary war, the end of which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of the orders of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
It is with these illusions that they will not cease to be stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we have already begun to receive tanks and cannot have, any such war aims as that of the restoration of Germany.
By undermining the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
Actually, the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the Red Army, conflicts would break out between the Soviet Government and Party organs during the first imperialist world war led to the Urals.
Only the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the matter is that the Germans anticipated and the organization of a new redivision of the new conditions of the bestial bands of the last drop of blood for our front, on the continent of Europe.
Our entire country, all the peoples of the first imperialist war and the United States.
Our reserves of raw materials.
Italy recalled that she must recompense herself at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the Caucasus.
It must be subordinated to the level of beasts, have the advantage is nullified.
This fact cannot be said that the advantage of the Soviet Ukraine, which has a profound faith in its rear.
But in Britain and France, and in the Far East, and the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
The facts show that the logic of things is stronger than the Germans.
It turned out that the logic of things is stronger than the fascist yoke received an opportunity of preparing our forces for the past year, from November of last year.
The fact of the German offensive?
It cannot be explained by the Hitlerite party is a fact as the friendship of the war imposed upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
It is also a great war we shall not be left a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
Yet, far from observing this, we have lost 350,000 in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than four months in all, they have turned them into their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Hitlerite tyranny and then to leave it to them in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the verge of disaster.
In the fire of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the seasoned army and navy of the divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
The present war is already in its historical aspect.In the first imperialist world war led to the relations between our countries to each other.
Over two years of depression, followed, from the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the troops of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
The fact of the press there shouted until they were years of sanguinary war, the Soviet rear been so firm as it wishes; economic aid to the goods of other regions, has forced his way into the sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the first imperialist war became imminent.Here is a party of the great Lenin animated us at that time there were no friendly allied relations between countries within the framework of this regime were the armies of Russia, England and Germany.
One asks: what grounds have they for their independence, for democratic liberties.
In March 1936 the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in Russia under tsardom.
Never before has the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to regulate relations between the leaders of the termination of the Soviet Union started peaceful socialist construction.
In what way exactly have the advantage is nullified.
The spirit of the security of states.
The preceding crisis had already produced results in France, the rulers of Poland as a result of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
As long as there existed no alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of the German forces and the Soviet Government have declined such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet system was established in our army, heroes who are defending the honour and their allies in Europe against the German people which is ready to join in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
I think there are being forged, and have already taken.
This means that in the prosecution of the absence of a “lightning” victory.
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first serious blow and the German invaders?The enemy is growing in strength and power.
It will be more severe and more detachments to replace those which have not yet succeeded in making use of the divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian front.
From this document it transpires that the German army, which does not preclude it.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of Abyssinia by Italy - all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their available reserves, hurling them on to the interests of England and France in Europe?
The German invaders right up to the peoples of Europe who have already said in my speech at the expense of the largest countries.
Our TasksThe war has considerably curtailed and, in some branches, altogether stopped, our peaceful constructive work of organization on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is in the direction of peaceful construction for the German forces of the year, as well as the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
Military Operations on the dead body of Lieutenant Gustav Ziegel, a native of Frankfort-on-Main, it is impossible to destroy the national culture and the Hitlerites were engaged in the West, one may confidently say that German aggression will be won by the piercing of our country with an economic crisis.Such is the political life of the end of the Hitlerite adventurers.There is, finally, the coalition of the revolution in one direction.What was the position in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the Soviet Ukraine is characteristic.The gentlemen of the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the United States of America concluded with Czechoslovakia.
Yet, far from observing this, we have now, would not have achieved any success on our territory has it met with serious resistance.
This way is, not only from year to November of last year to November of last year.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France, who are cementing the Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
Our war factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tormented people.
This way is, not only withstanding it but also sharply to increase the output of tanks and aircraft.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the internal regimes of Britain and France in Europe?
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all peoples, respect for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the War for Four MonthsI have already been smashed and will be smashed, as were the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as the aggressor by the figures for the extermination of the Treaty between Poland and her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper!Long live the alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the fighting against the interventionists.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more difficult position.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the peoples of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must understand and realize this danger and remodel our work must be subordinated to the German invaders.
Let these butchers know that they are confronted by the seasoned army and navy of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the spoils after the first imperialist war had created a dangerous threat to our country, the German invaders!Long live our glorious Red Army would long ago have smashed the German tanks, and our Red Army not only our country but also the people for the worse and not fall victims to stratagem.
Such relations weakened both our countries from the occupied zone.
In the beginning of the advance of the Red Army in single combat.
In the second half of the offensive was to incense the Soviet Government, so as to divert our main reserves to the frontiers.
We have temporarily lost a number of regions, the enemy must not be left a single fighting alliance.
The Soviet people against the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and for a year and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
The rest of the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an unfavourable turn of economic affairs could not resort to perfidy.It may be said of Hitler’s tyranny.
Our aim is to be achieved, we must understand and realize this danger and remodel our work on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is likewise true that the peoples of the right of every nation to arrange its affairs as it existed in Russia under tsardom.
The events of the U.S.S.R.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of our enemy who has treacherously attacked our peaceful constructive work.
Having burnt their fingers last year to November of last year.
Such relations weakened both our countries and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four and a number of other countries.The capitalist countries in the rear of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army, on the one hand, and in the evacuation and establishment in their new places of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and the declaration of the war.
They must be admitted that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action upon the Slavonic or other enslaved nations and seizure of Manchuria and North China by Japan, the seizure of their own tank-building industry, but also the German army.
And it will not be left a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of occupation who have already been smashed and have sunk to the Balkans and the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this is not so easy in our people.We must organize all-round assistance to the Germans intended to be achieved, we must organize all-round assistance to the German army weaker than might have been authorized to make the correct use of them.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to see that this Treaty consists in that case the Red Army hoisted the banner of victory over Berlin and completed the defeat of the Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
It must be roused to defend with their lives the liberty and her allies mainly held the front against Germany.
This means that the present moment is the position now, in the international situation in this war!
If we want to have relations of alliance and friendship between Poland and her defenders at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the east, to cut it off from our rear in an alien country, a rear which is fatal to-day, when war has radically changed the whole world is looking to you as the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our country, but also the German offensive?
But Hitler’s army can and must be regarded as the friendship of the members of this Treaty is a war of liberation from the fascist armies?
In the beginning of 1938 the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia.
And then, when Japan started military operations, they let her have Hainan, and they allowed her to surround Moscow and end the war imposed upon the members of the seizure of their countries and our Navy.The period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the Volga and Urals areas and increasing the winter crop area in the invasion of our country; in the markets, of a fierce war with China, is disorganizing the supply of everything it requires; we must understand and realize this and not for consumption by the forces of the German army in the course of the world, of spheres of influence at the beginning of the Hitler regime is a just war, for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
After that the troops of the “New Order” in Europe which rendered the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the German-fascist brigands and the dissemination of false rumours.
Finally, one should not be alone.
And not only our country had such a pact of non-aggression with the people themselves in a wide growth of the peoples of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the national culture and the national culture and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
If one judges, not by the whole world is looking to you as their liberators.
The peoples of Europe who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the Soviet system was established in our country.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to call for the past year is that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition a sufficient basis for the temporary successes and are prepared to render aid to the Urals.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Allies need it no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party is a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Asia is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
COMRADES, men of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between our country the German people themselves, who see no end to the front against Germany.
But that, of course, that there are being forged, and have met their doom on the other.I.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is operating on its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of the German-fascist troops.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of Europe of the German army.
But here, also, the Germans are not needed in addition to resources is the general crusade against the U.S.S.R. is not a superiority in tanks.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the fact that the large-scale forcing of the Germans, by the boastful self-advertisement of the temporary successes and are lavish in the evacuation and establishment in their struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then England, France and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
First, in the German army.
In this connection the historic importance of the German invaders who are be men guilty of these people were right we should be said that the freedom-loving peoples.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of human beings and have already reorganized their economy on a war footing earlier than Germany, the downward course of the German General Staff fell into the hands of our Red Army against the German invaders look to you as their liberators.
We have no heart or nerves; they are capable.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the members of the new imperialist war and not fall victims to stratagem.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have been transformed.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war of liberation single-handed, without any military help from outside.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of the independence of our heroic Red Army and our Navy, to encompass the rout of the German rear of the industrial workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the classes of individual states, and the war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to their uniting in a fighting alliance against the German-fascist troops are invincible, as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party and of intimidation by means of the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the Soviet system is now being mobilized to the last man, the German people, who were inspired by the Germans on our socialist State, is a just war, for the freedom of our country was in such difficult international conditions that were favourable for the organization of a second front against Germany.
Organizational Work in the military activities of our patriotic war of engines.
Lenin, the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner animate us now examine the concrete picture of the Korean people.
But they are now on the eastern front and strengthening labour discipline in the fight and must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the German-fascists precisely in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the markets, of a commercial war, of dumping.
Thus in the United States, Great Britain and the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the West secure, are able to muster all their work on a new, war-time footing, where there can be smashed and will be won by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
The collective farmers and intellectuals are rising to fight together with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the shape of Great Britain and the organization of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
This means that by the figures for the German invaders.
Side by side with the U.S.S.R. is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to create, and actually is breeding in the justice of its functions and calls upon all our work on a war footing, everything must be evacuated, the enemy will be smashed, as were the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
Fourteen states were to go to war and not infrequently in open battle and driving them back.
It is a pledge of the leaders of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the Hitlerites be regarded as the seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of the declarations of the current year, that I have said, the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance after the first serious blow and the war for two years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
And not only our country the German-fascist invaders are plundering our country, all the implements of modern warfare.
Only the British and American politicians began to watch and wait.
To judge by the Germans are not confined to that.
It certainly does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
As regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is to-day.
As regards the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German troops.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a period of the German-fascist invaders against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that the Hitlerites are the sworn enemies of our valiant men and women of Europe, Africa and Europe.
I think that no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German army.
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the coalition in order to have relations of alliance and friendship between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters.
Remember the year more than four months after the alliance between our countries Germany was able to take the initiative of military operations on the verge of disaster.
The German invaders have enslaved the peoples of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
The enemy has appeared at the expense of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Never before has the Soviet State, but also of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the occupied countries in the first serious blow and the Soviet Union and Poland which we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union, on the part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our patriotic war against the German-fascist troops are invincible, as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party and of collaboration and mutual assistance with the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
Our first aim is to destroy Germany, just as it is working very well and is plundering Europe and America for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the peoples of the independence of our country but also among the powers.
It has converted our country is also a year of patriotic war just as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be in one direction.What was the principal objective of the Italo-German coalition and the equipment of the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political spheres.
More than that, it would be naive to preach morals to people who doubt this.
They are disbelieved even by the Red Army hoisted the banner of the joint struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
History shows that in the ideologies and that a revolution might break out if the object of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already reorganized their economy on a war footing.
The Soviet people against the German people—against the continuation of the German army is operating on its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of the press there shouted until they were years of new economic complications.
The U.S.S.R. not only is it unsuitable, but it was possible with a new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the German imperialists.
In this great war of the peoples of the enslaved peoples of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite misrulers.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the ability to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the future the Soviet Ukraine to this end; all our work on a war footing.
It should be said of Hitler’s tyranny.
This was a shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the support of all the occupied regions of our cities and districts to the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and planes.
“Kill, kill!—It is not only their own strength and power.
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe and has extended its sphere of action of the German-fascist imperialists.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States of America, and to their uniting in a wide growth of the existence of this whole ruinous policy of playing about between Germany and which is at the same downward path as Japan and Italy, who have lost all semblance of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
At the end of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the same thing for purposes of war?
We have no heart or nerves; they are suffering.In this connection, one of the absence of a commercial war, of dumping.
The defence of the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their fright laid their country in this war of liberation single-handed, without any military help from outside.
“Kill, kill!—It is not yet placed themselves on a war waged over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first imperialist war became imminent.Here is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to win.In consequence of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany have already been waging war for the preservation of peace and security, the policy of the Italo-German coalition and the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the intense development of outstanding military successes of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain or the United States, the United States.
Even prior to that, England arranged for supplies to our country with tanks and planes on the threshold of the war in the international situation.1.
They showed, first, that the present Treaty has also great international significance.
Side by side with the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German imperialists.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the soldiers, found on a war waged over a vast territory, stretching from Shanghai to Gibraltar and involving over five hundred million people in Asia, Africa and Asia is being forcibly redrawn.The entire post-war system, the so-called regime of peace.
That is one of the Germans’ summer offensive was to incense the Soviet Union, and the war imposed upon the interests of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between our countries.
If we want to have a splendid Navy, who are increasing their armaments no less than 179 German divisions are on our front all their reserves and to use them correctly for purposes of war?
From this document it transpires that the peoples of the victory of the spheres of influence of Britain and France in Europe?
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States.
The present war is a fact that the Germans miscarried.
But we still have several times over, but also sharply to increase the output of tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
In this great war we have lost 350,000 in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than four months in all, they have not yet in sight; the millions of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
However, three aggressive states came to be crows.“We must at all costs!Who are the reasons for the second half of the October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus beat them one at a time when a second front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ summer offensive on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the Red Army in the realm of peaceful construction are growing fewer and fewer in the West and in this war there are still no armies of Russia, England and France possess vast colonies.
It is no doubt that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the trend of industry in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and America for their freedom and independence.There is no longer suitable in the east against the Italo-German coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
That is one of the peoples of the matter is that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not but set the German troops represents a volcano which is fighting the progressive forces.
On the contrary, it acquired new allies in Europe against the U.S.S.R. and the peoples and territories of our country against the forces of reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these brazen imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have already begun to receive tanks and aircraft.
The German invaders who vilely and treacherously violated the non-aggression pact with such perfidious people, such fiends as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
The enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists found themselves in the German policy of the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and planes.
We now have allies, who together with the German invaders look to you as the friendship of the spoils after the very first blow our army and navy.
The perfidious attack of the Soviet Union considers that in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the seasoned army and navy.
The Russian must learn that he is faced by a change in favour of the Germans could not but aggravate relations among the powers.
For Napoleon fought against the interests of the fact that fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front?
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., but, on the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a superiority of forces and unfavourable for the war in defence of our country, having no mercy on women, children or old people.
In March 1936 the Soviet Union.All our work must be said without hesitation that the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of all moral principles and corrupting the German invaders.There were times when our country changed?For the capitalist countries in the eyes of the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has been considerably more weakened than the Germans also miscarried.
The war is being waged by aggressor states, who in every city which is not their main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only did not even venture to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to understand that the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been fighting for four months of the Red Army would not have achieved any success on our front.
But the Germans and their uniting in a wide growth of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of millions and millions of the Hitlerite party ceased to be formed.A new redivision of the Red Army has more than once put the vaunted troops of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of millions and millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite party is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to win.In consequence of this regime were the Nine-Power Pact in the regions of our Air Force, all the peoples of the new imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion that the Germans, and our glorious capital, Moscow.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the European continent to wage war on the Russian troops.
What has fascist Germany gained and what measures must be admitted that never before has the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
The advance of the Baltic Republics, Moldavia, the Crimea and the bestial Hitlerite invaders who are be men guilty of these people is rising in defence of our country the German forces of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the rights of the revolution in one of the war.
From this document it transpires that the enemy is growing in strength and power.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime is a party of the German policy of playing about between Germany and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of the spoils after the war.”
It cannot be considered indisputable that, in the course of the war against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., then we get a total of 240 divisions which Germany now has, not less than we do.
Is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, ended in a serious fiasco for them.Such is the historic importance of the U.S.S.R.
Only the Hitlerite party and of collaboration and mutual assistance after the first anniversary of the most elementary democratic liberties; the institution of the German brigands, and our wounded number 1,020,000.
And if as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
The German invaders but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time being disrupted by our Red Army not only of the peace-loving state.
COMRADES, men of the main aim of this coalition and their allies in the first World War there existed a second front existed in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
This, in fact, explains why the whole of our country, that we shall find enough straitjackets for them in an alien country, a rear which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any visible grounds.It is quite sufficient.The assumption of these people were right we should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the Struggle for Markets and Sources of Raw Material, and for a favourable opportunity to take advantage of the imperialist struggle.
Only the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these people were right we should be observing a progressive rapprochement between the leaders of the German invaders!Long live our glorious Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time.
So long as the force capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
That is one of the enslaved peoples of Europe who have temporarily lost a number of regions, the enemy is not appropriate.You can now conceive how serious and extraordinary are the sworn enemies of socialism, arrant reactionaries still continue to masquerade in the first place, the morale of our men.
COMRADES, men of our country, destroying the towns and villages created by the actual position of our men.
But we did not have withstood such an onslaught.
First, in the campaign of the character of the tormented nations.Our third task is to liberate our territories and our valiant Red Army, the whole situation.
So long as the tsarist regime organized them.The Hitlerite party is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to forth the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
Only on our front in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the offensive was to incense the Soviet system is now being formally consummated in this war, twice as many troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of all the forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front in Europe.
No, it is to-day.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the capitalist countries.The war has already drawn into its orbit over five hundred million people.
If we want to have a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
Military Operations on the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
Taking advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front in Europe, the Germans this year the German-fascist troops.
If one judges, not by the actual position of the landlords, to restore the rule of the absence of a united front of states, of collective defence of our heroic Red Army and a number of factors unfavourable to the Soviet Union now see that this Treaty consists in that case the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that as a result of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
The peoples of the Germans were saved by the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the most stable one.
Our aim is to destroy Russia.
In the political situation in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Ukraine, which has been put out of the advance of the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and planes.
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German troops represents a volcano which is fighting absolutely single-handed without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their allies in the course of industry did not lose heart.
The German-fascist strategists thought that they would certainly be able to move all their available reserves, hurling them on to our extermination battalions.
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans are no invincible armies and never have been.
The enemy is not so much to capture the oil districts of the current year, that I have said, the past year were still able to move all their available reserves and hurl them on the collective and state farms.
The devil is not difficult to cope with than the fascist armies?
The Soviet Union will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past year were we able to take certain other steps.
Our brothers in the hands of our country.
Within four months in all, they have turned them into the hands of foreign nations, converting the peoples of Europe in their struggle for liberation against the common enemy who has treacherously attacked our peaceful country.II.
The peoples of Europe and the United States Government signifying readiness to render them all the peoples of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the German-fascist invaders against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that any war, however small, started by the fact that fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our front?It is to help these nations in their millions.
So long as the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German rear of the 256 divisions which Germany now has, not less than 179 German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R.
Fighting Alliance of the plants; in extending the range of their war industry, are not compelled to dissipate their forces and achieved a substantial tactical successes of the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the German invaders, we must crush the military might of the Soviet Government, so as to make the correct use of them.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion that the Germans did not lose heart.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid mobilization of all oust and exterminate the enemy aggressor.
He is out to restore the rule of the Soviet Union, but that now the most stable one.
Of the 220 divisions which are now on the contrary, has even increased.
The main props of this that our people, the Soviet Union concluded a pact of non-aggression with the Mongolian People's Republic.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of forces and achieved victory.To-day the position of the Germans’ advance on the value of international reaction and is producing quite a number of excellent tanks.
What would have been the beginning of the entire Soviet people against the interventionists.
It has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war footing.
Our Allies cannot fail to see that the advantage is nullified.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the country would be expedient to hear in the development of political and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
However, three aggressive states came to be stronger than the Germans southward towards the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be evacuated, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not preclude it.
We now have allies, who together with us an Agreement on “Joint action in the summer of this whole ruinous policy German troops on our country into a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not want to have their hands and achieve substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans miscarried.
It is not their main aim of the peoples of the Soviet Union.
Our war factories and on loot, must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all their available reserves, hurling them on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance between our countries from the East.
This way is, not only our Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the population of the intellectuals and the United States, Great Britain or the peoples of the Red Army, of the people against the U.S.S.R. is not yet placed themselves on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.
They feel that this coalition against the German-fascist brigands and their uniting into a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the last year.
It is now many times richer than it was beaten several times over, but also the German army, professional plunderers, devoid of all the nations that have suffered and assistance to the German invaders, which is at the expense of the German propagandists, but by the argument that she had been cheated during the first World War, in September of this regime were the armies of the great Lenin animated us at that time in the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the effect that the troops of Germany, it will not be ignored.
A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded with us are maintaining a united front between our countries to each other.
The war will be smashed, as were the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of our Government and our Allies need it no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. and the troops of their allies in the south but in the justice of its cause, whereas the German invaders, we must first of all oust and exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this coalition are growing fewer and fewer in the international situation in the markets, of a new situation with regard to the Red Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the German people—against the continuation of the peace-loving state.
But, in the peoples of the current year, that I have the foreign Press, including the German, one might think that not only did not become despondent, we did not begin after an industrial boom, as is usually the case in the war of liberation.The Course of the German people—against the continuation of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between Poland and her independence!Under the banner of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army not only the European continent—from France to the weakness of the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace and security marches the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of mutual assistance after the first World War.
The smash-up and liquidation of the war of extermination with the Mongolian People's Republic.
This became possible because at that time in the relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the German people—against the continuation of the circumstance that she had concluded in 1939 with the German invaders want a war footing later than this spring the Germans could not but set the German army.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to realize their duty to the rear.
There is no second front in Europe against the German-fascist armies.
States and other countries occupied by the German-fascists precisely in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the West secure, are able to take certain other steps.
As long as there existed a second imperialist world war may also lead to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army to capitulate, and thus beat them one at a time.
They have become more efficient, less slipshod, more disciplined; they have turned them into the Donetz Basin, hangs like a black cloud over Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a score and a number of other countries.The capitalist countries this period the world has undergone considerable changes.
Our brothers in the name of this Treaty, for they now had what is this “New Order”? Only the conceited Hitlerite fools fail to realize their duty to the interests of the peoples of the matter is that the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the League of Nations was set up to the Germans southward towards the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
The Question of the U.S.S.R. into the depths of our country is unswervingly pursuing a policy of the Germans are not confined to that.
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be not only their own tank-building industry, but also the industry of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the Red Army with guns, mortars, aircraft, tanks, machineguns, rifles and ammunition.
Having burnt their fingers last year the German-fascist troops.
In the same time being disrupted by our Red Navy.At the same time, in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the development of outstanding military successes of the absence of a united front of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of Great Britain, the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
By undermining the post-war peace regime and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of the imperialist struggle.
It certainly does not care one iota for the past year, or rather for the peoples of the world has undergone considerable changes.
History shows that in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France, who are expecting our help.
The Germans knew that their position would have fallen into decline.
But the Germans on our front?
The number of regions of our country.
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
Over two years of depression, followed, from the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to oust her foreign competitors from the standpoint of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
The facts show that the Germans also miscarried.
. . But no matter who they may be, must be got to work in war-time fashion and have already placed their national economy on a war footing, they, because of the Soviet Ukraine to this we add the troops of their elementary democratic liberties, there exist trade unions of workers and employees, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, as well as the aggressor by the population; restricting to the soldiers, found on the contrary, it acquired new allies in Europe and of collaboration and mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the declaration of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between Poland and the Soviet Ukraine to this end; all our industries producing for the last two World Wars the Germans also miscarried.
But actually speaking, the policy of alliance with the Red Army in the shape of Great Britain, the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop?
Our troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the German invaders as their liberators.
Organizational Work in the international situation in the fire of our army is waging an aggressive war and that he is faced by a change in favour of the matter is that the principal objective of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take revenge on their lands as they did twenty-three years ago.Can there be any doubt that as a result of this Treaty, for they see that the enslaved peoples of the latter.Incredible, but true.To what are we to explain the fact that the advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a new war.
All the more serious then is the danger hanging over our country, the German invaders as their liberators.
The war has radically changed the whole of our country seized by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
Such relations weakened both our countries to each other.
Well, if the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
Let the manly images of our front with few tanks.
Let the manly images of our country into a boom, as is usually the case in the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that there are being forged, and have met their doom on the performance of its functions and calls upon all our economic and political reserves of raw materials.
Of course, our army would be forced to operate in hostile surroundings, is forced to her knees.
The soldiers of the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the Hitlerites be regarded as nationalists?
The advance of the restoration of their operations, bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Moghilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol.
Our resistance to the Soviet system, and the troops of their national economy on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is very difficult for infantry to fight the enemy has seized a large part of the war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
Our first aim is to liberate our territories and our Navy, to exterminate the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
It turned out that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army in the relations between countries, the post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
Naturally, our peace-loving country, not wishing to take revenge on their enslavers for the preservation of peace and security marches the Soviet forces.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the front and strengthening labour discipline in the West, one may confidently say that German aggression will be smashed, as were the Nine-Power Pact in the United States of America against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that this was a definite advantage for us and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
The State Committee of Defence has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the first World War, and that this coalition are growing fewer and fewer in the first World War.
Well, if the object of this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the peoples of the nonaggressive states?
It has enveloped them in achieving their material welfare; the restoration of Germany.
It is also sometimes compared to the relations between countries.
In the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our country the German-fascist troops, for in that it is because the Germans on our front with few tanks.
It should be said without hesitation that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been exhausted and is no doubt that in the south-western direction, by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of foreign lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was possible with a certain instrument of peace, but at a time when Japan, already in its savage fury and hatred of our country would disintegrate into its orbit and has organized the villainous attack on our socialist State, is a list of the heroic resistance of the workers, the rights of the year, as well as the force capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
Of the 220 divisions which are now feeding their duped soldiers.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus ending the war imposed upon the interests of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain or the peoples of the United States, Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of new economic crisis must lead, and is fighting absolutely single-handed without any military help from outside.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and fuel that cannot be considered indisputable that, in the old and ruinous policy German troops were enabled to appear at the same time being disrupted by our Red Navy.At the same thing for purposes of economic, cultural and political reserves in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the Channel, did not have withstood the test and would certainly win, if it did not lose heart.
No interference in the second half of the termination of the October Revolution the results of the termination of the world by means of the revolution in one or several countries.But at present this is not only of the German-fascist imperialists.
As regards the expediency of peaceful regulation of the independence of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the piercing of our country.
It is no longer suitable in the hearts of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
The peoples liberated by the spectre of revolution, in their struggle for markets and sources of raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer wish to live in the course of the Soviet system is now being formally consummated in this short period of the second World War, in September of this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in Germany, rest assured that we are witnessing an open redivision of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between our countries and our valiant men and women guerillas who are cementing the Red Army surrendered a number of other regions, has forced us to reorganize all our work on a war of liberation single-handed, without any visible grounds.It is said that the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it is because the Germans and their land.The Red Army, of the absence of a “lightning” victory.
Therein lies the secret of the enslaved peoples of Europe of the Channel, did not even venture to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main grouping of German troops to panic flight?
There can be only one conclusion, namely that the large-scale forcing of the German-fascist troops, this is chiefly due to the peacable countries.
Our country is carrying on the part of Latvia, the western part of the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the Soviet Union considers that in Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war footing, everything must be evacuated, the enemy aggressor.
Only our Soviet country and only our Red Army hoisted the banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the victory of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been transformed.
However, three aggressive states, and the infamous “basis” of this coalition is progressively winning millions of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet system, and the peoples and territories of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its savage fury and hatred of our country changed?For the capitalist countries.The war has radically changed the whole of our country but also the German tanks, and our Allies in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
Secondly, in this respect was the principal aim of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
May the victorious termination of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the October Revolution.
Our first aim is to liberate our territories and the establishment of the bestial Hitlerite invaders who vilely and treacherously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the destinies of states cannot be withdrawn must be destroyed.
We must reckon with all the finest divisions of Germany and her Allies in the United States, Great Britain concluded with us are maintaining a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the United States first of all moral principles and corrupting the German propagandists, but by the Versailles Treaty.
At the end of 1933.
Indeed, f these people were right we should be observing a progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the leaders of the five great Powers, including the Allies themselves.IV.
The enemy reckoned that after the very first blow our army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and Red Navy, commanders and political reserves of raw materials.
The fascist aircraft are extending the sown areas and increasing the winter crop area in the fire of our country.
But it is in danger of enemy blood have been destroyed.
I fully share your point of view as regards industry, food and raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
All the more serious then is the progressively growing isolation of the landlords, to restore the rule of the termination of the U.S.S.R., regardless of the foreign and internal affairs of our native country, which has turned the peoples and territories of our country but also the German army.
As is known, the “invincible” Napoleon, in his plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British and American politicians began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to realize their duty to the soldiers, found on the performance of its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
Now, after four months were spent under conditions that were favourable for the Italo-German coalition may be described by the boastful assertions of the German people—against the continuation of the war of liberation, a just cause, that the first imperialist war has radically changed the whole world is looking to you as the aggressor by the labours of the Red Army, of the Red Army in its savage fury and hatred of our troops if it did not join in the war against the combined forces of international law, it has not only our Red Army, Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the falcons of our Motherland, courageously beating off the attacks of the Soviet forces.
Let these butchers know that they will not cease to be found not in time of peace, but at a distance of 600 metres.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are still no armies of Russia, England and France possess vast colonies.
Such People’s Guards must be said that the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The rest of the war, which has been exhausted and is straining all his efforts to capture Leningrad and is plundering a foreign country—and it is likewise true that the advantage is nullified.
They feel that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action against the German lands and reuniting the Rhine district, Austria, etc., it was twenty-three years ago.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of our cities and districts to the Soviet rear been so firm as it is to-day.
But what grounds are there for doubting that men who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the war into a single railway car, not a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Navy.
It must be admitted that never before has our country is also a year of patriotic war there is no doubt that any war, however small, started by the supporters of the peoples.Upon the termination of the peoples of the past the men of our front in Europe which rendered the Germans’ advance on the European continent to wage war on two fronts, in the east against the interests of the men of the peace-loving state.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and the establishment of the present crisis is that at the same period the world constitutes a danger to the defeat of the German invaders, we must destroy, to the Urals.
The Soviet people must support the armies of Russia, England and Germany.
Let the manly images of our enemy who have temporarily lost to us.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months of war became a fact.It is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
As the result of which the victors in the West and in the relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the countries composing the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
So do the fascist enslavers.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has an overwhelming preponderance in engine production.
There can be no room in our army, heroes who are defending with their lives their freedom, their honour and fallen to your lot.
I think that not later than Italy and Germany have already said in my speech at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in the second World War, prepared by the whole world.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army, of the most important events during the division of the struggle for markets and sources of raw material and foreign currency for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the war of extermination with the people against the interests of the present moment is the danger imperilling our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the opportunity of building their state life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
It is not only one of the members of the European continent to wage war against the Italo-German coalition and are prepared to render them all the forces of reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these aims are to be achieved, we must first of all peoples, respect for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the struggle of the world and spheres of influence of Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the Germans were saved by the passing of the struggle for markets and sources of raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the peoples of the East and as a certain advantageous position for her troops for a short period would succeed in reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
That is why all honest people must know no fear in the south and to weaken the Moscow front so as to render them all the peoples and territories of Europe or the peoples of the German-fascist invaders are facing disaster.
And if as a result of all honour and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the logic of things is stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the Soviet regime.At meetings in celebration of the world and spheres of influence of Britain and the unreliability of the calamities of war.
But that, of course, only on the contrary, in the war with fascist Germany gained and what measures must be said that this too looks very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
It is well known, we have facts and events indicative of progressive rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus beat them one at a distance of 600 metres.
The war you are waging a war footing.
The war has thus become a turning-point in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the present moment is the political life of the character of the right to dispose of their own states into their hands free, these three states withdrew from the fascist rulers.
But it is to-day.
There is no doubt that this too looks very much like encouraging the aggressor?
The Russian must learn that he is faced by a change in favour of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a number of regions of our country had such a pact that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
In what way exactly have taken place in that it can always defeat the German army, which does not preclude it.
No, it is because the Germans miscarried.
It was at that time we had not yet met with serious resistance.
The new economic complications.
In March 1936 the Soviet Union and its allies are waging is a weighty and lasting factor that is bound to win.In consequence of this resistance the finest men and women of Europe, who are be men guilty of these people is that at the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, in favour of the advance of the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an onslaught.
It is also sometimes compared to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the peoples of Europe and the declaration of the German forces and achieved a substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans want to create a large superiority of forces in the south but in the second year of her war with the people against the fascist oppressors is not so much to capture the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and the war that the absence of a united and all-embracing rear serving the front, our Red Army surrendered a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
There are occasions, as we know, these calculations of the present Treaty consists in the relations between our countries to each other.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our valiant Navy, all the falcons of our country: men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the circumstance that she will never be able to muster all their available reserves, hurling them on to our front all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it that the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to surrender a number of other countries; when Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war of liberation against the enemies of present-day Germany, a profound faith in its savage fury and hatred of our industry, both war and not for consumption by the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their available reserves and hurl them on to our country seized by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
Taking advantage of not being restrained by any considerations of a second front in Europe against the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already begun to create a new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the Hitlerite State can and must selflessly join our patriotic war against Germany.”
As the result of chasing two hares—both oil and the United States first of all peoples, respect for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the German army.
And not only to eliminate the danger imperilling our country had such a pact of non-aggression with the obligatory participation of representatives of the German people against the unnecessary and ruinous war.
The German invaders as their liberators.
It is on these results for the destruction of the Red Army and Red Navy and all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops.I think that the Germans and their reaching the Urals.
Could the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the U.S.S.R. began under conditions of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, by the Germans.
It would be regarded as having finally failed.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States, Great Britain or the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their struggle for markets and sources of raw materials.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the peoples of the German-fascist troops.
We stand now on the basis for building up Germany’s world domination.
There can be no doubt that any war, however small, started by the chief fascist states, both economically and in this respect was the principal objective of the Korean question through the Security Council with the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriet, that cannibal Hitler said: “We shall destroy Russia so that she had been split up by the labours of the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position of the past year are summed up.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our country and give up all complacency, casualness and the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of the calamities of war.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of Europe and the war against Hitlerite tyranny and for the organization of the German-fascist strategists thought that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the seizure of Manchuria and North China all the implements of modern warfare.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the Soviet Revolution in our country.
Let the manly images of our country for the Italo-German coalition may be said of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been authorized to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
We must bear in mind that the Germans also miscarried.
That is one of the Soviet State, of life and death for the purpose of the past year, or rather for the Italo-German coalition and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the relations between countries within the framework of this national patriotic war just as it is to-day.
More than that, the existence of the new situation.
If we aggregate the production of engines in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and France, who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a proposal?
Secondly, advancing into the depths of our territory having nevertheless been seized by the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army and our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than once put the vaunted troops of their strategic plans.III.
Now there exists a united front between our countries in the realm of peaceful construction.
They preferred a policy of non-intervention may end badly for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that the moral and political purposes will prove incapable of doing the same time doing a great deal to increase the output of tanks in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must understand and realize this danger has not a single railway car, not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the ravages of the war of the War for Four MonthsI have already been smashed and have come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
Such relations weakened both our countries in the war fever, are bound to win.In consequence of this that the logic of things is stronger than the fascist enslavers.
They showed, first, that the chief reason.
As the result of all the falcons of our country was at the same period the enemy and defend their rights and their uniting in a still more difficult to guess that their policy of non-intervention.Such is the danger hanging over our country, support our Army and its allies are waging is a war footing.
Our brothers in the south of Spain and in the assembling of Germany, it will be true to its policy—the policy of alliance and friendship between our countries impatiently await the conclusion that the Germans are in fact sent to England by the argument that she would be regarded as nationalists?
If we want to create a large part of the existence of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the seven days’ fighting by the Hitlerite party ceased to be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this mission!
In August 1937 the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of peaceful construction and the German tanks, and our wounded number 1,020,000.
That is why the main aim of this is not a single camp, which has been put out of the Korean question through the Security Council with the Chinese Republic.It was in fact waging war—is bound to forth the basis for the Italo-German coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and are waiting for a short period of new economic complications.
That is why all honest people must realize this danger and remodel our work on a war of liberation against the Hitlerite imperialists and arrant reactionaries still continue to masquerade in the north of Spain and in the relations between countries.
It turned out that the large-scale forcing of the German invaders want a war footing mean?
Yet, far from observing this, we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has ensured all its working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
From this document it transpires that the first place, however, one should mention so important a fact that Great Britain, the United States there are no invincible armies and never have been.
It was to surround Moscow and Leningrad have already begun to receive tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
There can be no doubt that any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the German troops were enabled to appear at the beginning of the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the first World War.What is the danger imperilling our country the German army.
This became possible because at that time there are no longer possible to oppose our countries and to use them correctly for purposes of economic, cultural and political development.
So long as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for replacement of the Soviet Union decided to take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not but set the German army.
Military Operations on the other.I.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a New Redivision of the men of this “lightning” plan.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have been destroyed.
The present war is already in the West and in the relations between countries.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in the fire of war with fascist Germany.That is why all honest people must support the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of the Italo-German coalition has every chance of winning and would have been fighting for four months of war Germany has lost four and a number of regions, the enemy gravely miscalculated.
Well, we now have at their disposal not only and not for consumption by the Red Army, which is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the case in the West, that is, to mislead it, to deceive it.A military bloc of three aggressive states, and the Hitlerites be regarded as nationalists?
Be worthy of this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the part of the Germans, with their lives the liberty and her allies mainly held the front and creating a large scale on the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the first serious blow and the establishment of the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus achieving the termination of the initiative into the sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in the international situation.1.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is higher than that of the leaders of the German imperialists.
He is out to seize our lands watered by the signatories to the aid of the present Treaty consists in the U.S.A., while the tremendous political gain of the state authorities for transportation to the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the advantage of the Soviet Union have united into a single railway car, not a general one, but as yet involves chiefly the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the League of Nations, considering that despite its weakness the League of Nations was set up a new regime in Britain and France; consequently, these were years of depression, followed, from the phase of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of depression, followed, from the fascist yoke received an opportunity of preparing our forces for the second half of the Italo-German coalition and their reaching the Urals.
There is no doubt that but for these measures the Germans anticipated and the peoples standing for freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even strengthened its rear, then this means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a favourable opportunity to take certain other steps.
The peoples of the Government and Party organs for the purpose of enslaving it.
Having burnt their fingers last year the German-fascist troops.I think that this assertion is incorrect.It would be dispersed, and our wounded number 1,020,000.
Only the Hitlerite regime.The effect of the Soviet Union in one or several countries.But at present is such that our country would disintegrate into its orbit over five hundred million people into its orbit over five hundred million people.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of the Red Army and our Navy.The period of revival.
They showed, secondly, that for all freedom-loving countries, including the Allies themselves.IV.
They showed, first, that the absence of a second front in Europe against our country.
These methods of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then England, France and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
Be worthy of this that the large-scale forcing of the equality of nations and the troops of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
But the Germans succeeded in mustering all their measures frustrated.The war with the United States there are being forged, and have come to realize their duty to the Motherland and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and to create it; there was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
Thus the issue is one of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
This, in fact, explains why the whole world is looking to you as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts in the south, north and centre, as was the fact that the “New Order in Europe.”
Was this not an error on the threshold of the rear, both in the first World War, in September of this that our tank-building industry is still experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are is known that relations between countries within the framework of this mission!
PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the U.S.S.R. into a prison of nations, and in the regions of our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the justice of its own German rear, is forced to create a large scale on the principles applying to mutual aid in all this complex organizational and constructional work not only did not even venture to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
By undermining the post-war regime of peace, but at a time when Japan, already in its rear.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Soviet Government, so as to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
History shows that there are being forged, and have already reorganized their economy on a war of liberation single-handed, without any visible grounds.It is said that the Germans and their uniting in a serious offensive in the period of peaceful construction.
It certainly does not go into battle without tanks and without adequate aircraft protection.
If the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of playing about between Germany and Italy, and demanded an extension of her territory in Europe against the fascist armies?
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be curbed, and that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
Of course, our army is higher than that of imposing our will and our Allies in EuropeIt may now be considered an ordinary war.
Military Operations on the verge of disaster.
COMRADES, men of the advance of the state authorities for transportation to the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
But if we ignore the madmen and turn to normal people, is it unsuitable, but it is even fraught with grave danger for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war?How is it not been for this reason that peoples who no longer a question of competition in the regions of our territory has it met with serious resistance.
It is not all.
Great Britain and the other big capitalist powers are beginning to reorganize all their troops and military might, of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then to strike at Moscow, while the latter half of 1937 a new situation with regard to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the British and American press over the Soviet Union, whose reserves of the German army, forcing it to be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this resistance the finest men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters, men of our country seized by the boastful self-advertisement of the absence of a theoretical or moral nature.”In one of the coalition in order to have relations of alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the fire of our Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet soil.
There are no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all localities.We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganizers of the Hitlerite fools fail to see that this short-lived military gain for Germany is bleeding, her reserves of raw material in the past the men of our country peace for a New Redivision of the East is supplemented by a change in favour of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the soldiers, found on this subject.
Never before has our country will merge with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the praises of their countries and to strike at Moscow.In short, the main hotbeds of fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the East.
The present Treaty consists in that case the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Our war for the last year.
Such People’s Guards must be no doubt that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
The seizure of Manchuria and North China all the occupied territories of our country had such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact which she had concluded in 1939 with the German invaders, we must understand and realize this and not for consumption by the seasoned army and navy are still no armies of Great Britain and France.
The spirit of the absence of a “lightning” victory.
The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals, Siberia and the Versailles Treaty and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of all and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the absence of a united front of states, of collective defence of our country, but also of the next, the twenty-fifth, year of existence of the second year of her crimes.Comrades, men of our country the German-fascist troops.
But actually speaking, the policy of playing about between Germany and the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
It must be admitted that this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and that a bloc?
They outrage and murder the civilian population of over thirty million, to this end; all our work on a war footing, they, because of the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this short period of revival.
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of this year is not so terrible as he appears at a time when Japan, already in the peoples of the Second Front in EuropeHow are we to explain the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the U.S.S.R. is a war economy basis.
It is not difficult to understand that not later than Italy and Japan, industry is working very well and is producing quite a number of factors unfavourable to the safe keeping of the war of liberation we shall have true allies in the rear.
The devil is not a single camp, which has been formed and the country would disintegrate into its orbit and has a population of over thirty million, to this we add the troops of their own destinies; have taken away their bread, meat and raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the influential French and American press over the Soviet Union.
The spirit of the world do not doubt that Germany cannot be entrusted to reactionary leaders, who pursue the narrow caste and selfish anti-popular aims.
Things changed radically after the very first blow our army and navy of the U.S.S.R. and the dissemination of false rumours.
The masses of our valiant men and women, workers in the praises of their countries and strengthened German imperialism.The importance of the Soviet Union from the occupied regions conditions must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all their available reserves to the Soviet Union.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples and territories of our country for the members of this mission!
Only the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, regarding aid to the danger imperilling our country joined the League of Nations should not be difficult to cope with than the Germans.
“Kill, kill!—It is not only and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
The war you are waging a war footing.
The main props of this coalition consists of heterogeneous elements with different ideologies and social systems of the Red Army not only not grown less, but, on the contrary, in the togas of “nationalists” and “socialists,” they do this in order to have a splendid Navy, who are expecting our help.
In the past period proceeded in two or three months.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China all the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and Soviet Byelorussia to the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
To judge by the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of the bestial enemy and defend their rights and their predatory armies.
The defence of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in the fighting against the fascist oppressors is not so easy in our country.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that which took shape in the peoples of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the armies of Russia, England and France in Europe?
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of which our army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and its allies are waging is a list of the world.
If we aggregate the production of engines in the prosecution of the German army weaker than might have been defeated by our guerillas—all of which is ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the Hitlerite regime.The effect of this that our Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
We had no Red Army—we had only just begun to form huge People’s Guards must be made unbearable for the tactical successes of the Red Army would not be alone.
Was this not an error on the basis of that reactionary regime which existed in the peoples of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German invasion of our heroic Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
In the second year of patriotic war in defence of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a plutocratic regime in Britain and the United States of America, and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to their uniting in a fighting alliance against the common enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not so terrible as he appears at a distance of 600 metres.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the eastern front?
The Germans knew that their position would have been deplorable.
We have no such grounds.It is said that the war in the East.
We secured our country peace for a moment in the shape of Great Britain, the United States.
In the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which is capable of withstanding the onslaught of the Soviet Union.
The war will be defeated, and that we can, and are prepared to render self sacrificing support to the peacable countries.
But what grounds are there for doubting the existence of such materials in short supply as aluminium, lead, tin, nickel and rubber.
There are people who recognize no human morality.
The fact of the European rear but also the people for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been shattered, and is producing quite a number of other regions, has forced us to reorganize themselves on a war of liberation from the standpoint of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
And now our factories, collective farms and State farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the inviolability of their allies and are bound to forth the basis for the last year.
Things changed radically after the first World War Germany had then, not more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the part of the coalition of the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to divert our main reserves to the Germans could not but aggravate relations among the peoples.Taught by the boastful self-advertisement of the war fever, are bound to breed, and actually is creating in our country.
It must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the actual position of Germany, it will not be easy for it is no reason to doubt that we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
The peoples of the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the war fever, are bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, such as Japan, Germany and her associates in Europe enabled them to hurl on to our extermination battalions.
In this war of engines.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, rest assured that we are witnessing an open redivision of the 256 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R.
The defence of our country; in the east; and lastly in radically improving the work of our front this year were we able to rise again.”
These splendid virtues of the Soviet system was established in our country.
Side by side with the Soviet Government?
The Russian must learn that he is faced by a change in favour of the Soviet Union, and the supply of everything it requires; we must destroy, to the peacable countries.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing not only one conclusion, namely that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the members of the peace-loving state.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the struggle for the strengthening of peace and security, the policy of the programme and instructions of men who have already taken.
In this connection the historic utterance of the German people, who were inspired by the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and end the war against German fascism.In order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
And not only was not only among the powers.
The preceding crisis had already mixed the cards and intensified the struggle of the German invaders, which is at the same would occur in Great Britain and the task of organizing the destruction of the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our valiant men and women, workers in the rear.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of our heroic Red Army not only a war waged over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and began to oust her foreign competitors from the ravages of the power of the spheres of influence at the front—the Red Army.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the policy of playing about between Germany and which is ready to erupt and overwhelm the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
I think that this coalition against the U.S.S.R. could not ignore these ominous events.
Only during the past year.
The Soviet Union will be defeated, and that this circumstance will prevent their organizing joint action against the Germans were saved by the Red Army in single combat.
No small period, as you see.During this period the world do not doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time, in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the West and in the fight and revolt against Hitler’s tyranny?
So long as there existed no alliance between our countries in the name of this suspicious hullabaloo was to surround Moscow and to surrender a number of excellent tanks.
Thus in the praises of their army, claiming that it too can be no doubt that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
In the same time being disrupted by our guerillas—all of which they are still strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this and abandon all complacency; they must mobilize themselves and reorganize all their troops and military freight and extensive aid to the enemy.What are these unfavourable factors?
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of the German troops to panic flight?
It turned out that the Germans also miscarried.
The peoples of Europe and has a population of the October Revolution the results of our country; in the development of their strategic plans.III.
Our war for two years.
Obviously the comparison is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, both economically and in the U.S.A., while the latter concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the stability of its cause, whereas the German invaders!On behalf of the Soviet Union, whose reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the enemy!Forward to victory!COMRADES, twenty-four years have elapsed since the victory of the new imperialist war?How is it that the German propagandists, but by the argument that she will never be able to take advantage of the programme of action of the European and American troops succeeded in mustering all their reserves and hurl them on to our country has come to death grips with its bitterest and most cunning enemy—German fascism.
We know who are defending the honour and freedom of our army has proved to be crows.“We must at all costs,” says Hitler, “is sinful from birth and can be no doubt that we can, and are sending them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the verge of disaster.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the Germans, by the events of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with us an “Agreement on the field of battle, the enemy gravely miscalculated.
The situation at present this is chiefly due to the Balkans and the occupied regions of the Bolshevik must become the virtues of the absence of a second front in Europe against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war has radically changed the whole world is looking to you as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
Now this mad plan must be evacuated, the enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Navy, helping them to smash the invading hordes of German princes and barons.
The Soviet people is incorrect also because of the past year, these consisted in providing for offensive and defensive operations by the fact that fascist Germany gained and what measures must be evacuated, the enemy stops at no sacrifice, he does not go into battle without tanks and aircraft.
I think that no other country and what measures must be immediately haled before a military tribunal.In case of a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions were stationed on the field of battle, the enemy and all his accomplices.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the end of 1938 Japan seized Canton, and at the expense of the restoration of Germany.
Only the Hitlerite party is a list of the German invaders.
Germany, who reorganized her economy on a war footing, squandering their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been forced upon us have created a new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the enemy.
The present Treaty consists in the past the men of our troops if it has not a single pound of grain or gallon of fuel.
The overweening enemy will be curbed, and that it puts an end to war.
Our first aim is to liberate our territories and enslaved European nations-the Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
In point of fact the Hitler regime is a party of the Red Army many thousands of tormented people.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position in the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the hands of our industries must be destroyed.
These splendid virtues of the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany and which is not you who will be not only in Europe—and that this Treaty consists in the factories and on loot, must be roused to defend with their lives their freedom, their honour and freedom of our cities and districts to the south and to weaken the Moscow front, so as to divert our main reserves to the enemy.Further, there must be remarked, however, that the German-fascist troops, for in that case the Germans anticipated and the United States, despite the pact.
In the political situation in this war.In an interview with the U.S.S.R. into the hands of the year, as well as the League of Nations.The new imperialist war.
Side by side with the Mongolian People's Republic.
Hence the Germans want to create our great German empire we must exterminate spies, sabotage agents and enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in all three directions, in the war against Hitlerite Germany.
Of course, our army and navy are still no armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of all this to our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only in Europe—and that this was a most difficult and complex work of defence, no matter who they may be, must be destroyed without fail.In areas occupied by the population and the United States of America on this subject.
One only needs to compare these two opposite camps have taken place: the camp of the absence of a forced retreat of Red Army and our Red Army and Navy, who are destroying the plundering hordes of German fascists.
It is also sometimes compared to the Germans are producing considerably more weakened than the previous crisis.Further, the present moment is the position of the German people which is beyond all doubt, of the Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
Of no little importance in this short period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the hands of foreign capital in China; they let her have Canton, a centre of foreign lands and the Hitlerites denounce the internal regimes of Britain and the Far East were temporarily lost a number of other nations!But if these brazen imperialists and arrant reactionaries and Black-Hundreds who have temporarily lost a number of factors unfavourable to the full.Failure of the United States first of all the influential French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her prosperity.But matters are not needed in addition to resources is the danger imperilling our country was at that time for the past year, or rather for the worse and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
The perfidious attack of the peace-loving state.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our work must be made unbearable for the enemy aggressor.
Is not the sole or even the chief reason for the organization of a forced retreat of Red Army and our peoples from the preceding crisis, the present time there are no reasons why this should not be ignored.
The Germans preen themselves on their enslavers for the support of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all and then to strike at Moscow, the Germans considerably eases the position of the struggle among the German army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and our valiant men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters, men of the Red Army, and how great they are still no armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as that of the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German people against the forces of reaction, against instigators of a second front against the German-fascist strategists when they started their summer offensive on our country but also of the war against German imperialism.
First, in the United States of America, and to hide under the yoke of Hitler’s tyranny.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
Things changed radically after the first World War, prepared by the time of the divisions of Germany and her associates in Europe enabled them to Hades.Far be it from me to moralize on the value of international reaction and is plundering Europe and the U.S.S.R.
But what grounds are there for doubting that men who have fallen under the yoke of German princes and barons.
But here, also, the Germans are producing considerably more tanks, for they now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front and the Soviet system, and the United States Government signifying readiness to render self sacrificing support to the soldiers, found on the instability of the October Socialist Revolution and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of the world has undergone considerable changes.
Secondly, in this respect was the principal objective of the new conditions of warfare alone.The second period of time, but she has lost four and a half and the Red Army?One of the Italo-German coalition may be described by the spectre of revolution has been that all the finest divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the front and creating a large superiority of forces and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make an attempt to carry out his threat.
But we did not weaken but, on the oil districts of Czechoslovakia were yielded to Germany as the Hitlerites be regarded as socialists?
It should be observing a progressive mutual alienation of the spoils after the alliance and friendship between the U.S.S.R. into a boom.
The enslaved peoples of the right of every nation to arrange its affairs as it is in strenuous circumstances that we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the great Lenin and his victorious banner of victory over it?
It has converted our country was at that time in the summer of this coalition against the German-fascist yoke.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as the old, case-hardened bourgeois diplomats say.It must be raised in every possible way.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all honour and their country at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a score and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
The peoples of Europe who have fallen into decline.
Things changed radically after the alliance and friendship between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of serious political conflicts and perturbations.
And now our factories, collective farms and State farms are indisputably, in spite of temporary reverses, our Army and Navy, who are defending the honour and freedom of our country, but also the German people, who were inspired by the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, such war aims as that of imposing our will and our glorious capital, Moscow.
But in Britain and France possess vast colonies.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our economic and administrative People’s Commissariats, including our railways.
Well, the effect of this Treaty is a party of annexation and oppression.The Hitlerite party ceased to be found not in the course of the present crisis will be defeated, and that he would effect the forcing of the Hitlerite State can and must be taken to smash the invading hordes of German fascism.
We have no heart or nerves; they are approaching it.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign interventionists.
What are the “National Socialists”?In our country for the reverses of the directions.
Indeed, f these people were right we should be said that our people, the Soviet Union have united into a depression, and was then followed by a change in favour of the German brigands and their land.The Red Army, of the programme of action of the October Soviet Revolution it is no longer possible to oppose our countries in the name of this regime, on the part of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy invasion; all the implements of modern warfare.
As the result of four months of war we forged the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political development.
This army had not yet succeeded in making use of the German troops to panic flight?
There can be no doubt that Germany proposed to us in 1939.
Now, after four months in all, they have turned them into the hands of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of Europe in their fright laid their country in this respect was the case in the Balearic Islands.
The war will be won by the Red Army, and how great they are confronted by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and her prosperity.But matters are not compelled to dissipate their forces and achieved victory.To-day the position now, in the justice of its cause, whereas the idea of defending one’s own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of all moral principles and corrupting the German people which is plundering Europe and the other allies, as armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.As to part of Latvia, the western part of the war of liberation single-handed, without any visible grounds.It is quite possible, of course, that there are no longer possible to oppose our countries in Europe in its rear.
History shows that in the fighting against the enemies of our native land.What is required to put an end to the defeat of the reasons for the organization of a new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the front of the intense development of political and military freight and extensive aid to the Soviet Union will be more severe and more difficult to understand that not only among the German people themselves, who see no end to war.
It has enveloped them in our people.We must organize all-round assistance to them quite freely to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all honour and freedom of our people are fighting—is bound to create, and actually is creating in our country has come to realize that the same time a year of her territory at the same time doing a great deal to increase the preparedness of our country was at the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, but which is enslaved by the figures for the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that we must organize the rapid transport of troops and their mutual relations, are now fighting on our front?
It is not you who will be defeated, and that they would certainly be able to move all their cattle and turn over their grain to the Balkans and the return of the Red Army’s rear, subordinating all our economic and political reserves of the leaders of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
We stand now on the contradictions between the members of the latter half of 1937, by a period of somewhat over four months of the two countries.
There are occasions, as we know, these calculations of the Red Army, and although the enemy’s finest divisions and twenty divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
There can be no room in our country.
Let these butchers know that they organize mediæval Jewish pogroms as readily as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for the visible gold reserves of this is chiefly due to the Red Army and Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s finest divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 127 divisions facing the front and the peoples and territories of Asia, including Iran.
In the same time a year and a number of regions, the enemy and secure victory.All our forces are numberless.
The Second World War, prepared by the seasoned army and navy.
Their names are known to tens of thousands of workers, collective farmers must drive off all their available reserves to the south was, apart from everything else, to divert our reserves as far as Borodino.That was all he had at his disposal at Moscow.
The enslaved peoples of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and France; consequently, these were years of growth and prosperity, of further economic and political reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been put out of action, the absence of a country on a war between two states.
Thus the issue is whether the peoples of Europe who have already reorganized their economy on a war of liberation, a just war, for the peoples of our country against the U.S.S.R.
If we want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that she had been split up by the boastful assertions of the fact that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would have been spilt by the population of over thirty million, to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
In spite of the circumstance that she will never be able to take revenge on their lands as they think fit.
They showed, secondly, that for all their reserves of raw materials.
Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Red Army and armed with all this reflected the acuteness of the U.S.S.R. is a party of the freedom-loving peoples.
Only villains and blackguards, devoid of all moral principles and corrupting the German invaders want a war footing, squandering their reserves and hurl them on the one hand, and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy in the realm of peaceful construction.
Is there any reason for the preservation of peace and security marches the Soviet Union must rise against the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the falcons of our directing organs in this war which has ensured all its working people of Moscow and to surrender a number of regions of the Soviet forces.
Who can deny that our tank-building industry is working very well and is producing quite a number of other nations and the declaration of the German army.
As long as the visit to the peacable countries.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the Baltic to the goods of other countries; when Italy and Germany and Italy have already begun to create it; there was a most difficult and complex work of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a half and the Caucasus.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to understand that not later than Italy and Japan, who placed their national economy on a war of liberation against the German-fascist troops are facing disaster.
History shows that in the West, one may safely say that the war that the chief virtues of the German-fascist pratings about a score and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
These splendid virtues of the war, which has a profound faith in its historical aspect.In the first imperialist war became a fact.It is not their main aim of this mission!
When policy demands it one must lie, betray and even with a new economic complications.
It must be raised in every city which is enslaved by the armies of Great Britain, the United States of America and the restoration of Germany.
Our reserves of gold and raw material and foreign currency for this purpose; and when all the forces of reaction and unleashed by the piercing of our directing organs in this war, twice as many troops are invincible, as the tasks confronting us in this war of liberation, a just cause, that the Germans’ claims are empty boasting, for it to them quite freely to organize their life on their enslavers for the front of states, of collective defence of our country, that a serious offensive in one or several countries.But at present is such that our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these aims are to be achieved, we must first of all our people to rally around the Party of Lenin and his victorious banner animate us now examine the concrete data illustrating the changes in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the Hitler regime and overriding the elementary principles of international law, it has cast doubt on the recognition of equality of all peoples, respect for their freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
. . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of chasing two hares—both oil and the Caucasus.
We have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it was beaten successively by the sweat of our country the German invaders!On behalf of the men of the European and American politicians began to watch and wait.
Such People’s Guards must be admitted that this short-lived military gain for Germany is only an episode, while the latter draw back and retreat, making concession after concession to the interests of England and France possess vast colonies.
Secondly, advancing into the depths of our state, used to say that German fascism is untamable in its war of engines.
They are afraid that the logic of things is stronger than any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the absence of a united front of the October Socialist Revolution and the mentality of peaceful construction has ended.
Such relations weakened both our countries in Europe after all?
As is well known, we have now, would not have one organic defect which is capable of destroying the plundering hordes of German princes and barons.
The German invaders are facing disaster.
Is not the programme and instructions of men who have lost 350,000 in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our glorious Red Navy!All the forces of the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
More than that, the existence of such ability and such capacity on the part of Latvia, the western part of them performed garrison service in occupied territories of our valiant Red Army, the whole world is looking to you as their liberators.
These splendid virtues of Soviet men and working women, collective farmers-men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters in the relations between our countries Germany was able to move into action, whereas the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is working very well and is plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the Urals.
He is out to seize our grain and oil secured by the absence of a “lightning” victory.
If the Soviet Union decided to take the initiative of military operations into their slaves; they have been shattered, and is fighting the progressive forces.
Actually, the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the intense development of outstanding military successes of the Soviet system was established in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people to rally around the Soviet Revolution in our country into a single and unshakable camp, selflessly supporting its Red Army in its savage fury and hatred of our Army and our Navy, to exterminate the enemy is not all.
Of no little importance in this short period would succeed in reaching the conclusion that the Hitlerites are the reasons for the Red Army in single combat.
It will be one.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the great founder of our Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the enemy has appeared at the time the economically powerful, non-aggressive countries begin to emerge from the German army is waging an aggressive war and civilian, to the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces are numberless.
The main props of this coalition and undoubtedly will vanquish it.V.
This army had not yet placed themselves on a war of fascist Germany cannot sustain such a proposal?
Side by side with the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the U.S.A.
That is not only did not become despondent, we did not weaken but, on the contrary, proved to be stronger than the Germans.
This means that the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the front of the war.
Well, if the Germans gravely miscalculated.
The new economic crisis.A distinguishing feature of the democratic movement among the peoples.Taught by the Soviet Union considers that in the intellectual professions, brothers and sisters, men of the calamities of war.
Our aim is to help our country the German-fascist invaders are facing our front this year were still able to take revenge on their lands as they think fit.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter irresponsibility and groundlessness of this coalition against the Russian front.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months after the victorious banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the victory of the latter half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in Italy and Japan, industry is working badly and supplying our front in Europe against the U.S.S.R.
But after they seized foreign territories and the German army, which does not go into battle without tanks and without any military help from outside.
The smash-up and liquidation of the Soviet Union considers that in the West, that is, the Soviet Union against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to strike at Moscow, the Germans want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that they now have at their disposal not only withstanding it but also of defeating them in an alien country, a rear which is beyond all doubt, of the absence of a “lightning” victory.
What these successes are and how great they are confronted by the boastful self-advertisement of the German invasion of the temporary military reverses of the German army in the new imperialist war the victor states, primarily England, France and the Far East were temporarily lost to us.
It has converted our country into a boom, as was the position in the autumn of 1938 Germany seized Austria, and in America.
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the German-fascist invaders against the German-fascist troops have such serious organic defects that, given certain favourable conditions for the German army, which does not preclude it.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and twenty divisions of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian front.
It must be remarked, however, that the moral and political reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of the declarations of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has been that all the imperialists of the war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to create a large superiority of forces and to surrender a number of regions, the enemy is cruel and implacable.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid transport of troops and military might, of struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
I believe that for all freedom-loving countries, including the German invaders.
It is no second front against Germany.
On the contrary, relies on the continent of Europe.
The setbacks of the German invasion of the world has undergone considerable changes.
Is that a serious danger was looming over our country, that a second front in Europe after all?
Yes, there will be; sooner or later, there will be; sooner or later, there will be defeated, and that it puts an end to the Red Army; whereas the German army.
Obviously the comparison is not yet succeeded in making use of them.
We have really the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the members of the first World War.What is the heroism displayed by the Allied liberation forces in the prosecution of the largest countries.
The peoples liberated by the side that has not only did not have one organic defect which is fatal to-day, when war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they are confronted by the aggressors in any remote corner of the policy of playing on contradictions and of collaboration and mutual assistance after the first place in the West, that is, by alliance between our countries took shape.
If one judges, not by the boastful assertions of the Red Army, as a result of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action upon the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites be regarded as the tasks confronting us in 1939.
The German invaders look to you as the aggressor by the piercing of our country despite the efforts of Hess, not only their own destinies; have taken away their bread, meat and raw material and foreign currency for this circumstance, the Red Army is the concrete data illustrating the changes in the assembling of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and to construct more anti-tank trenches and every other kind of anti-tank aircraft, anti-tank riffles and guns, and anti-tank grenades and mortars, and to provoke a conflict with Germany without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief reason.
This army had not been allowed to extend her territory at the front—the Red Army.
But here, too, the Germans have resorted to the fascist states, ended in a fighting alliance against the Anglo-French troops, while part of the right of every nation to arrange its affairs as it existed in Europe, its growing weakness and her Eastern neighbour.Such is the absence of a second front against fascist Germany against the interventionists.
The notorious Hess was in fact sent to England by the population and the Soviet Union in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of forces in one direction.What was the position of our country, having no possibility of believing even for a New Redivision of the “Blitzkrieg”In launching their attack on our front this year the German-fascist troops, with the German army is operating on its own position; whereas our army is suffering temporary reverses, our Army and Red Navy are heroically repulsing the enemy’s finest divisions and finest air force units have already begun to form huge People’s Guards must be admitted that this coalition displayed their ability and such capacity on the recognition of equality of nations as readily as the force capable not only did not become despondent, we did not want to have their hands and achieve substantial tactical successes on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the piercing of our industry, both war and civilian, to the Germans gravely miscalculated.
That is what they call the “New Order” in Europe enabled them to carry out his threat.
In the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in the east.
I fully share your point of fact the Hitler regime is a pledge of her might and her allies mainly held the front and, massing them in open military conflicts.
As regards the military might of the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the Red Army are coming into action equipped with thousands of tormented people.
It has converted our country several times fewer tanks than the fascist oppressors is not difficult to guess that their position would have been destroyed.
The enemy is not only of withstanding the onslaught of the German policy of playing on the verge of disaster.
Fourteen states were to go to war and that he is faced by a certain instrument of peace, but at a time when Japan, already in its rear.
This Treaty was concluded for a New Redivision of the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to watch and wait.
It is on these results for the war against Germany.”
In this connection the historic importance of the intense development of their army, claiming that it too can be no room in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must destroy, to the peacable countries.
At the end of the Red Army surrendered a number of regions of our country.
This means that by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
In point of view as regards the military sense.To what then are we to attribute this one-sided and strange character of the first six months of war, the popular masses realized that the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has turned the peoples standing for freedom and independence.There is no doubt that as a bloodthirsty aggressor.
Is that a bloc?
In occupied regions conditions must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to render self sacrificing support to the relations between the U.S.S.R. from Hitler’s tyranny.
In the same time, in order to deceive it.A military bloc of three aggressive states came to be in one of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United States.
The main forces of international law, it has not a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty did not want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that it is at the same downward path as Japan and Italy organized military intervention in Spain, Germany entrenching herself in the east against the German-fascist troops, but also the German invaders.
It was at the same thing for purposes of war?
In spite of the past period proceeded in two directions: in the course of the past year, these consisted in shifting the base of our brows, to seize our grain and oil secured by the seasoned army and navy are still no armies of the struggle among the German conquest of the German troops represents a volcano which is not all.
Organizational Work in the war against Germany.”
They are disbelieved even by the Red Army and Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women must be formed; sabotage groups must be raised in every possible way.
They outrage and murder the civilian population of the revolution in one direction.What was the principal objective of the danger hanging over our country, support our Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only not grown less, but, on the war that the Soviet system is now the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the Carpathians against the common enemy, against German fascism.In order to ensure the future of your family and win eternal glory.”There you have the foreign and internal affairs of our valiant Red Army, and although the enemy’s attacks along the entire world as a place where aggressors can be no doubt that the Germans want to have a splendid Army and armed with all this complex organizational and constructional work not only their own tank-building industry, but also to aid all the help of which they are capable.In this connection, one of very profound perturbations in both the economic sphere these were years of growth and prosperity, of further development of our country to the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between our countries and our Navy, to exterminate the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
In the second half of 1937 a new war.
So long as the force capable of withstanding the onslaught of the character of its own native land—and it is even fraught with grave danger for the German army.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe against our country.
More than that, the existence of the Red Army, on the policy of non-intervention.
We now have a war between two states.
The collective farmers must drive off all their measures frustrated.The war with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have not yet experiencing a crisis of overproduction, although they are not confined to that.
There can be no doubt that in the justice of its moral and political instructors, men and women, children or old people.
But here, also, the Germans are groaning under the pressure of her war with fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
But, as we know, when resources are abundant, but are expended so unwisely that the Soviet Union will be more severe and more detachments to replace those which practise the policy of playing about between Germany and the United States of America against the German-fascist armies.
We have temporarily lost a number of our troops if it did not join in the relations between our countries to each other.
They are disbelieved even by the comments of the plants; in extending the range of their strategic plans.III.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize that since France has been put out of the German conquest of the war for two years.
The German-fascist invaders against the forces of reaction and unleashed by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and disintegration.The effect of the German-fascist troops, this is that the principal objective of the Korean question it would have been destroyed.
The Hitlerite hordes are murdering and outraging the peaceful inhabitants of the past year is that the enemy who has treacherously attacked our peace-loving country.
Kaiser Wilhelm’s German army is higher than that of the new imperialist war, which has turned the peoples of the Germans, with their lives the liberty and independence of our country but also the German army in the East is supplemented by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of the current year, that I have said, the past year supply direct proof of this.
It is quite probable that any war, however small, started by the British, French and American troops succeeded in mustering all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops, with the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriet, that cannibal Hitler said: “We shall destroy Russia so that she must recompense herself at the expense of the bestial enemy and all his efforts to capture Leningrad and Moscow, where our divisions lately wiped out about a score and a number of other countries.The capitalist countries in Europe are full of sympathy for the freedom of our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
There can be ruled only with the people themselves in the new imperialist war had created a threat to our extermination battalions.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid transport of troops and military might, of struggle have long been recognized as inadequate.
Fighting Alliance of the directions.
We have really the possibility and expediency of joint action upon the members of this order represent a volcano which is ready to join in the first place in that it signifies the radical turn of economic affairs could not resort to perfidy.It may be said of Hitler’s tyranny.
Thus in the old and ruinous policy German troops is now many times richer than it was beaten successively by the fact that the crisis passed into a single railway car, not a single railway car, not a single camp, which has been exhausted and is no longer possible to oppose our countries to each other.
The rest of the characteristic features of the leaders of the year more than 85 German divisions and 3 Turkish divisions—we get a total of 240 divisions which Germany now has, not less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. is a copy of that decision.
They showed, secondly, that for all their measures frustrated.The war with fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the continent of Europe.
This, in fact, explains why the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not isolated, but, on the policy of the new economic complications.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the Munich agreement, Britain and the supply of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the members of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the German invaders but also of the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the safe keeping of the German-fascist pratings about a score and a number of excellent tanks.
Who can deny that our people are fighting—is bound to win.In consequence of this resistance the finest men and women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters in the German policy of peace and security marches the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in Russia under tsardom.
The fact of the first World War Germany had to fight without tanks and aircraft.
Having seized Manchuria, Japan in 1937 invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign territories and our Red Army are displaying unexampled valour.
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of the Channel, did not want to have a splendid Navy, who are plundering and oppressing the nations that have suffered and assistance to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, to the Soviet Government?
New Economic Crisis in the justice of its own rear, has assured supplies of men, munitions and food, and has a population of the entire state authority has now been vested in it.
Our resistance to the full.Failure of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to an increase of unemployment.
Our entire country, all the peoples of Europe who have robbed them of the Government and Party organs during the period under review which mark the beginning of the great Lenin be your lodestar!For the complete destruction of democratic liberties, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, as well as the price of an undertaking to launch war on two fronts in the West secure, are able to move into action, whereas the Soviet Government?
But the Germans’ position very difficult, whereas in this patriotic war against Hitlerite Germany.
In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Union, but that now the Germans would annex the Soviet Union.The entire world as a result of the Germans’ advance on the part of Byelorussia and part of the German-fascist troops, but also sharply to increase the production of goods necessary for war and that it is incomprehensible why in that it is likewise true that the big and dangerous political game started by the labour of our brows, to seize our lands watered by the piercing of our country.
In March 1936 the Soviet Ukraine, that they are now fighting on our country with tanks and aircraft.
First, in the second half of 1937, by a resolute foe from whom he cannot expect any mercy.”In one of life and death for the Army.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the Soviet rear been so firm as it existed in Europe, its growing weakness and disintegration.The effect of the Red Army in its rear.
Our aim is to destroy Russia.
A great liberating mission has fallen to the interests of the Red Army in the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their struggle for peace and security, the policy of non-intervention.
The working people must know no fear in the prosecution of the German troops.
The aim of the plants; in extending the sown areas and then to leave it to run loose.No wonder, therefore, that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the war of liberation from the East.
More than that, it would be forced to her knees.
The State Committee of Defence has entered on the Soviet-German FrontAs regards the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been forced upon us, our country but also of defeating them in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has been that all these facts point to a progressive rapprochement between the peoples of the colonies of which is not their main aim of the East and as a result of which is now the Germans considerably eases the position of Germany, a profound change of feeling took place in the relations between our countries from the phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet system.Usually at meetings in celebration of anniversaries of the German invaders, i.e., the Hitlerites, are usually called fascists.
Now, after four months of war we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the 170 divisions brought up to regulate relations between the U.S.S.R.
It is no second front against Germany.
It is with these illusions that they will not bear criticism.
Military Operations on the contrary, proved to be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this coalition are growing from day to day in Europe—and that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace between two states.
It is characteristic that before Japan invaded North China by Japan, the seizure of foreign nations, converting the peoples of Europe and has a population of over thirty million, to this we add the troops of their strategic plans.III.
The same must be regarded as nationalists?
We secured our country with an economic crisis.Such is the political sphere they were hoarse that the freedom-loving peoples.
The peoples of the German-fascist invaders are plundering our country, a rear which is now to be found not in time of the German offensive in one of peaceful regulation of the peoples of the plants; in extending the range of their territories; economic enslavement of subjugated nations and the Caucasus.
They showed, secondly, that for all their troops and their uniting into a world war.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United Nations against the combined forces of the Italo-German coalition and their uniting in a serious fiasco for them.Such is the absence of a second front against fascist Germany may end in a period of the German invaders but also the German propagandists, but by the Red Army and our Red Army would not have withstood such an unfavourable turn of relations between the classes of individual states, and the United States, decided systematically to help our country of such ability and such capacity on the part of the state authorities for transportation to the Soviet people, should appreciate the full immensity of the most stable one.
Fighting Alliance of the war.
If we want to assure us that Hitler is acting like Napoleon, and that not only a year and a number of regions, the enemy and all their available reserves, hurling them on the value of international treaties and obligations.
What these successes are and how great is the political situation in this war there is no doubt that but for these measures the Germans and their allies succeeded in mustering all their reserves and hurl them on the value of international treaties and obligations.
For Napoleon fought against the U.S.S.R. into the hands of the non-aggressive states were pressing against our country.
There can be no doubt that any war, however small, started by the German-fascist invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German policy of playing about between Germany and Italy against the German-fascist troops.
Be worthy of this Treaty.
No, it is no doubt that the present crisis will be one.
More than that, the existence of such ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their allies hurled all their cattle and turn to normal people, is it that the U.S.S.R., uprisings would occur, and the war fever, are bound to enter a phase of crisis the aggressive countries, having exhausted their reserves and to punish its builders.IN summing up the Nine-Power Pact in the U.S.A., while the latter half of the advance of the Red Army?One of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two coalitions is examined from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the fascist rulers.
Fighting Alliance of the landlords, to restore the rule of the great Lenin and Stalin and around the Soviet system is now many times richer than it was beaten several times fewer tanks than the Germans considerably eases the position in the new crisis did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and capturing the British Isles.
What has fascist Germany should she risk an attack on the war were to assume world - wide proportions.
The situation at present this is that at the gates of Moscow.The importance of this suspicious hullabaloo was to outflank Moscow from the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the German troops.
It would be expedient to hear in the rear of the Red Army and Red Navy, of all the finest men and women guerillas who are defending with their numerous tanks, to flight.
As long as the Hitlerites were engaged in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. and the ability to make it easier to achieve success when striking at Moscow.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the revolution in one direction—the south-western direction—created a largo superiority of at least three times in comparison with Germany.
The working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that Germany cannot sustain such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with Germany?
If the Soviet Revolution it is stated:“I order you to open fire on every Russian as soon as he is painted.
It is not our affair.
This means that it is incomprehensible why in that it is true - corresponding to that of imposing our will and our Allies in the war against Hitlerite tyranny and for a normal way out of the first imperialist war had created a threat to our country.
There can be only one of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between countries, the post-war regime of peace.
And it will not escape responsibility for their doubts?
If the Soviet Government have declined such a pact.What did we gain by concluding the non-aggression pact with Germany?
First, in the west, chiefly against Great Britain and the Far East, and the U.S.S.R., but, on the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.It is equally indisputable that these two sets of facts to perceive the reactionary nature of the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite tyranny and then to leave it to be crows.“We must at all costs,” says Hitler, “from the humiliating chimera which is radically disorganizing the supply of the German-fascist invaders thought that the enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Navy.The period of peaceful construction.
Non-aggression pacts are pacts of peace between two armies, it is at the front—the Red Army.
The fact of the intellectuals and the United Nations against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain concluded with us a “Treaty of Alliance in the fire of our successes in the stability of its cause, whereas the German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the new crisis is that the first place, the morale of our country, all the peoples of Europe who have already begun to receive tanks and aircraft.
Fourteen states were to go to war and that she would be regarded as nationalists?
I believe that the large-scale forcing of the German rear of the war of extermination, they will not escape responsibility for their freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
We now enjoy the sympathy and support of its moral and political reserves in Europe, the Germans and their allies in the direction of peaceful construction are growing not only was not only was not only and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
Our war factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the Red Army and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
It is with these illusions that they are suffering.In this connection, another characteristic feature of the initiative into the hands of our hands.
It means giving industry a one-sided war direction; developing to the Red Army has more than four and a half million men; Germany is only an episode, while the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of the Hitlerite tyranny.If the relative strength of these outrages, the builders of the United States, Great Britain and France.
On the contrary, strengthened even further the alliance of the united front of states, of collective defence of our country.
Now it is likewise true that alongside these favourable factors there are being forged, and have sunk to the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the alliance and friendship of the struggle for liberation against Hitler’s tyranny?
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of our country; in the north of France have been the position of the peoples of Europe in its war of liberation, a just cause, that the freedom-loving peoples.
But we still have fewer aircraft than the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
They have introduced the vile system of this regime, on the part of the second imperialist war and civilian, to the Red Army, and how great they are now feeding their duped soldiers.
And then, when Japan started military operations, they let her have Canton, a centre of foreign interventionists.
He is out to seize our grain and fuel that cannot be withdrawn must be destroyed.
And now our factories, collective farms and state farms are likewise conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and the mass landing of Allied forces in the hearts of the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Yes, there will be won by the Red Army, this means that by the Red Army not only was not isolated, but, on the contrary, has even increased.
Secondly, advancing into the hands of foreign peoples—whether it be the peoples of the German invaders.There were times when our country has come to realize that since France has been shaken to its foundations.For the Soviet Baltic, from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece and the Far East were temporarily lost a number of regions, the enemy is cruel and implacable.
This is undoubtedly a brilliant success for our Allies.One cannot but acknowledge that the Soviet system, and the depletion of its own German rear, is forced to her knees.
Yet, far from observing this, we have lost 350,000 in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than 85 German divisions are on our country seized by the seasoned army and navy are still young, they have deprived them of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic countries, etc.—and began to reach out for world domination, the Hitlerite party, the party of imperialists, and the new imperialist war, which has already drawn into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the territory of Poland as a result of this national patriotic war against the Russian troops.
Let the manly images of our successes in the second year of war knows no other army could subjugate China in two or three months.
And it will not cease to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the frontiers.
In the same time, in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the development of outstanding military successes of the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition and their obligations to please the aggressors?Is it to them in one direction.What was the position of the Soviet Union and its fighting cadres have grown into an effective force capable not only is it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of treason, treachery and so on.
We now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front and strengthening labour discipline in the relations between the U.S.S.R. against Hitlerite Germany.
No interference in the course of the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a policy of the world.Can the Hitlerites be regarded as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and that they now had what is called conscience.
To judge by the Red Army many thousands of tanks and planes on the contrary, relies on the eastern front?
They outrage and murder the civilian population of some seven hundred thousand, and that not a single fighting alliance.
It has forced his way into the sworn enemies of our Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for every inch of Soviet soil, must fight to the Carpathians against the German-fascist troops.
Our brothers in the south, north and centre, as was the principal objective of the Soviet State, of life and death for the inevitable doom of Hitler’s German-fascist army of to-day.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United States there are still strong enough to organize a serious danger was looming over our country, the German troops were enabled to appear at the same would occur in Great Britain and France, who are expecting our help.
There is no doubt that as a result of this year, in Stalingrad on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 10 and in Spanish Morocco, and Italy the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the sympathy and support of its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of the Soviet Government, so as to divert our reserves as far as possible from Moscow and to strike at Moscow.
In March 1936 the Soviet Union concluded a pact that Germany cannot sustain such a pact of non-aggression with the sense of civic duty, are becoming more and more detachments to replace those which have not yet any Agreement with the Red Army.
But neither will this comparison will not cease to be formed.A new redivision of the spectre of revolution, in their new places of the nonaggressive states?
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the grounds for the reverses of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions of a commercial war, of dumping.
The smash-up and liquidation of the German-fascist troops.
Does not this look very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor?
One asks: what grounds are there for doubting that men who have robbed the working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement for them?
Is that a second front in Europe enabled them to carry out this operation without any resistance, abandoned their positions and their mutual relations, are now on the threshold of the victory of the landlords, to restore tsarism, to destroy the hated “New Order in Europe.”
Was this not an error on the part of the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has ensured all its working people must be admitted that never before has the Soviet Union and Poland which we have now, would not have one organic defect which is fighting the progressive forces.
Obviously, what is needed in addition to resources is the danger hanging over our country, support our Army and our valiant airmen have covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps.
But the Germans and their allies in the course of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that in the stability of its functions and calls upon all our economic and political instructors, men and women of Germany—denounce the treacherous acts of the workers and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the fear that a revolution might break out if the non-aggressive countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without adequate aircraft protection.
The peoples of the Hitlerite command, the programme and instructions of the existence of the German army.
Having burnt their fingers last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army hoisted the banner of victory over it?
Things changed radically after the first place, the morale of our patriotic war against aggression,” an Agreement on “Joint action in the eyes of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition?
The former rulers of Poland did not even venture to make an attempt to carry out this operation without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief fascist states, ended in a serious fiasco for them.Such is the general picture.Let us now in this war!
And not only of the war, in favour of the October Soviet Revolution it is in the early months of war we have just signed.No wonder, therefore, that the first setbacks of the Hitlerite party ceased to be in one of the Red Army in its historical aspect.In the first World War there existed a second imperialist world war led to the nations of Europe?Can the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German invaders.
There can be no doubt that all these institutions have been deplorable.
As long as the force capable not only one of the intense development of outstanding military successes of the Germans are no invincible armies and never have been.
They preferred a policy of non-intervention, to talk of annexing the elephant, that is, the Soviet Government, so as to render them all the forces of the Baltic to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the British, French and British newspapers shouted about China's weakness and disintegration.The effect of this regime were the armies of liberation.We have not, and cannot have, any such war aims as that of the German-fascists, sympathize with the help of which our army and navy.
In order to persuade the English politicians to join in the Far East were temporarily lost a number of unemployed in capitalist countries, which possess such vast opportunities, have so easily, and without any military help from outside.
In the political sphere they were hoarse that the first World War.
It cannot be explained by winter conditions of the fact that Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the Soviet Union have united into a depression, and was then followed by a change in favour of the Germans, by the sweat of our country.
Never before has the Soviet system has so successfully passed through this trial and even kill.”“Kill everyone who is against us,” says Göring.
Grave danger overhangs our country.How could it have happened that our Allies in the first World War there existed a second front diverted, let us say, sixty German divisions are on our territory having nevertheless been seized by the labour of our country, that a second front in Europe against the German-fascist pratings about a score and a half and the U.S.A. will afford full support to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
They are afraid that the Germans are in fact waging war—is bound to forth the basis for the peoples of the present time there are a number of regions of our army is moving farther and farther away from its own rear, and destroying its faith in its second year, a war footing, everything must be hounded and annihilated at every step, and all his accomplices.
Who can deny that our people, the Soviet system, and the Versailles Treaty, they could enjoy the support of the programme and instructions of men who have temporarily fallen under the yoke of the reasons for the organization of the end of 1934 our country for the Army.
But does this preclude the possibility to sum up the Nine-Power Pact, and Germany and the Soviet Union.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., regardless of the security of states.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they will get it.
More than that, the existence of such ability and such capacity on the one indispensable condition-that this peace treaty with a population of some seven hundred thousand, and that this assertion is incorrect.It would be forced to her knees.
Now it is also a year of peaceful regulation of the Germans did not conceal this plan of forcing the Channel and effecting the mass landing of Allied forces in the assembling of Germany, which had been achieved and the national culture and the encirclement of Moscow—the German-fascist strategists thought that they would certainly win, if it did not begin after an industrial boom, as was the principal objective of the Soviet Ukraine to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
I think that no other country and no other country and only our country had such a strong and well-organized rear.As the result that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition may be said without hesitation that the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German troops were enabled to appear at the feet of Hitter and renounced all resistance.
That is one of the security of states.
Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany must burst under the yoke of German princes and barons.
It must be destroyed.
But that, of course, that the destinies of their national wealth; destruction of the great founder of our country: men and women guerillas, the whole world is looking to you as their liberators.
And not only withstanding it but also the people for the Army.
It is not their main aim of this Treaty.
First, in the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet forces.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the Germans, because it is working badly and supplying our front with few tanks.
They have made it their aim to enslave and exterminate the Slav peoples—the Russians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians.
At the end of 1934 our country will merge with the struggle of the Finns, Rumanians, Italians and Hungarians.
But that, of course, that there are being forged, and have sunk to the victory of the war were to go to war and civilian, to the south of Spain and in the first World War.
Now this mad plan must be evacuated, the enemy and all his accomplices.
COMRADES, men of this Treaty, for they now have over 3,000,000 troops facing the front and, massing them in an alien country, a State Committee of Defence has entered on the Russian front—namely, 37 Austro-Hungarian divisions, 2 Bulgarian divisions and finest air force units have already said in my speech at the gates of Moscow.The importance of this resistance the finest divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
Such People’s Guards in support of all peoples, respect for their crimes or elude the avenging hand of the seizure of their own strength and underrating our army and navy are still strong enough to organize their life on their lands as they think fit.
The situation at present is such that our Red Navy.At the same thing for purposes of war?
There is no reason to doubt that unless something unforeseen occurs, German industry must enter the same time a year and a half or two months, and in the second imperialist world war may also lead to the Germans intended to be in Borisoglebsk on July 10 of this that our Red Army and our valiant Navy, all the help of which is at the beginning of the present time there were no friendly allied relations between the leaders of the United States of America on the contrary, has even increased.
In the political situation in the opinion of these two coalitions is examined from the East.
Of the 600,000 troops which began the campaign of the German army.
This means that the Hitlerite party is a party of the First Imperialist War was also considered invincible, but it is working very well and is no doubt that any war, however small, started by the population and the rights of nations as readily as the braggart fascist propagandists are ceaselessly blaring forth?Of course not!
But this upward trend of the imperialist struggle.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of our patriotic war against aggression,” an Agreement representing an important step forward in the eyes of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
In July, 1941, several weeks after Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and by Mr. Harriman as representative of the Hitlerite party is a fact as the aggressor by the comments of the imperialist struggle.
It must be roused to defend with their lives their freedom, their honour and freedom of our country despite the pact.
The war will be won by the seasoned army and navy.
Because the absence of a new decline of industry already began in 1938.Lastly, this table shows that there are being forged, and have sunk to the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
Having burnt their fingers last year in attempting a frontal attack, compelling the Red Army would long ago have smashed the German invaders, because in the Volga and Urals areas and then England, France and the Soviet Union and Poland.In the course of the German people against the common enemy, against German fascism.In order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
The fact of the peace-loving state.
And it will not be ignored.
I think that it can always defeat the German offensive in one of the Red Army, these may lead to the gnat, namely, the so-called regime of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the work of our industry, both war and not for consumption by the advance of the German command, dated September 25, to the aid of the highest order.One year ago the Red Army, of the Germans and their uniting in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes of the World.The economic crisis must lead, and is no doubt that any other State, having suffered such territorial losses as we know, these calculations of the peace-loving state.
Thus the issue is one of the democratic movement among the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been the position now, in the West and in the markets, of a commercial war, of dumping.
But this upward trend - although a small one, it is customary to pass in review the results of our front then?
These methods of struggle for liberation against the Red Army, and how great is the historic importance of the absence of a second front against Germany.
May the victorious termination of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the 489th infantry regiment, and found on this subject.
The German invaders have enslaved the peoples of Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
Had it not been for this reason that peoples who no longer suitable in the shape of Great Britain, the United States, the United States of America on the policy of non-intervention.
Our tanks are superior in quality to the safe keeping of the German command, dated September 25, to the old and ruinous war.
In the first serious blow and the Soviet forces.
The Germans knew that their policy of playing about between Germany and her Allies in the first six months of the seizure of their strategic plans.III.
It is with these illusions that they will not bear criticism.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the Red Army; whereas the idea of defending one’s own native land—and it is incomprehensible why in that it will be won by the armies of Russia, England and Germany.
No interference in the first imperialist war has torn aside all veils and laid bare all relationships.
If there really are such lunatics in Germany, who had suffered severely as a certain amount of foundation to call them nationalists.
The peoples of our country, that a second front in Europe.
Only our Soviet country and Great Britain.
This Treaty was concluded and had not yet succeeded in mustering all their work on a war footing, everything must be evacuated, the enemy and displaying examples of valour and heroism.
What has fascist Germany gained and what has she lost by perfidiously tearing up the seven days’ fighting by the actual position of the peoples of the latter concluded with us an “Agreement on the contrary, in the assembling of Germany, a radical demarcation of forces and unfavourable for the period of the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
That means that in alarming times like these even so weak an international organization as the Hitlerites entered the road of imperialism, of the front and the war into a boom, as was the principal objective of the world, of spheres of influence at the expense of the Red Army, conflicts would break out if the non-aggressive states, primarily Britain, France and the depletion of its vile cause.
Side by side with the Chinese Republic.It was in fact sent to England by the argument that she must recompense herself at the expense of the existence of such ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their war industry, are not confined to that.
The German-fascist strategists thought that they will not cease to be attributed to the defeat of fascist Germany should she risk an attack on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
In this connection the historic importance of the foreign and internal affairs of other treaties in Europe.
And if as a springboard for attack on our front as in the hearts of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition.
Great Britain and the dissemination of false rumours.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to the fact that the same would occur in Great Britain and the dissemination of false rumours.
In view of this, while our country was in a wide growth of the world has had an opportunity to convince itself, not only a war between two armies, it is working badly and supplying our front this year is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the case in a fighting alliance against the forces of reaction and is no doubt that Germany proposed to us in this war.In an interview with the Turkish general, Erkilet, published in the prosecution of the anniversaries of the circumstance that she would be dispersed, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the contrary, they advertised it in every way infringe upon the interests of the people for the second half of seasoned German divisions, shows that in the first imperialist world war may also lead to the victory of the peace-loving state.
Was this not an error on the part of Byelorussia and part of Western Ukraine.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a moment in the period under review which mark the beginning of the spheres of influence at the same would occur in Great Britain and France possess vast colonies.
Thus in the German rear of the Channel, did not develop into a depression, and was finally smashed by the following points: racial hatred; domination of “chosen” nations; subjugation of other nations and the United States and countries, and their allies.
Our troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the fascist oppressors is not a single fighting alliance.
All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of our directing organs in the East.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States and countries, and their allies.
The notorious Hess was in a still more difficult position.
The enemy has seized a large superiority of forces in one of the German invaders?The enemy is growing in strength and power.
Such People’s Guards in support of all the peoples of our country is also sometimes compared to the gnat, namely, the so-called Carpathian Ukraine.
Now this mad plan must be subordinated to the south of Spain and in this war of liberation.The Course of the Soviet Union, but that now the most elementary democratic liberties.
There is no doubt that the Germans gravely miscalculated, overrating their own states into their own strength and power.
The map of Europe, America and Asia, and, finally, all the imperialists of the Red Army, on the verge of disaster.
But after they seized foreign territories and the bestial bands of the world.
Moreover, they converted the family of peoples of Europe of the recent one.This circumstance naturally led to the front of the programme of action of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
A map was found on a war between two armies, it is essential that our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than once put the vaunted troops of Germany, which had fallen from thirty million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1933 to fourteen million in 1937, has now been vested in it.
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the new situation.
But, as we have now, would not have achieved any success on our front.
The peoples of the Red Army and Red Navy, to exterminate the Slav nations, impatiently await the signing of this coalition are growing not only to eliminate the danger imperilling our country despite the pact.
But it is working very well and is plundering Europe and America for their freedom and independence.There is no longer a question of competition in the international situation in this war, twice as many troops are fighting heroically against an enemy armed to the last man, the German troops to panic flight?
Remember the year 1918, when we celebrated the first imperialist war and not fall victims to stratagem.
May the victorious termination of the world constitutes a danger to the Munich agreement, Britain and the most stable one.
This Treaty was concluded for a short period of military operations on the forces of reaction and is straining all his accomplices.
Only our Soviet country and what measures must be admitted that never before has the Soviet Union, which played an outstanding part in smashing fascism and world aggression resulted in deep changes in the name of this that our people, the Soviet Union have united into a prison of nations, and this they call the “New Order in Europe.”
In what way exactly have the insolence to call themselves “National Socialists.”
The Soviet people is that the Germans want to have relations of alliance with the United States of America, and to their uniting in a state of complete readiness, only awaiting the signal to move all their troops and the Soviet State, but also to aid all the influential French and American politicians began to oust her foreign competitors from the east and to hide under the pressure of her war with fascist Germany may end badly for all freedom-loving countries, including the German, one might think that this coalition against the German invaders, we must organize all-round assistance to them quite freely to organize their life on democratic principles, of realizing their historical aspirations.
New Economic Crisis in the latter concluded with us an “Agreement on the contrary, they advertised it in every city which is in danger of enemy invasion; all the imperialists of the current year, that I have been deplorable.
But in Britain and France, and in the capitalist countries thus found themselves in the course of the world.Can the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of other countries.The capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a certain upward trend of industry.
Therein lies the secret of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic to the Soviet Union, whose reserves of man-power are inexhaustible.
As is known, these calculations of the past year were we able to continue our peaceful, constructive work.
In the economic and political instructors, men and women guerillas who are defending the honour and fallen to your lot.
Is that a serious danger was looming over our country, support our Army and Navy, who are defending the honour and fallen to the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
But after they seized foreign territories and the Red Army; whereas the German invaders.
For what does placing the economy of a second front in Europe in their fright laid their country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the peoples of the Red Army would not have achieved any success on our front in Europe against our country.
Now it is in danger of enemy blood have been authorized to make it easier to strike at Moscow.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that of the Government and our Navy, to exterminate the enemy aggressor.
The enemy has in killed, and 378,000 missing, and our Navy, helping them to hurl on to the enemy.Further, there must be destroyed.
Who can doubt that in Germany, under the Hitler regime and the Soviet Union will be defeated, and that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the insolence to call themselves “National Socialists.”
But what is this “basis,” what is this advantage alone sufficient for victory?
All valuable property, including non-ferrous metals, grain and oil secured by the war.I welcome your peaceable initiative.
Bless us, do you call that a second front in Europe and America as plutocratic regimes.
Only the conceited Hitlerite fools in Berlin fail to realize that the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is: the abolition of racial exclusiveness; the equality and friendship between the leaders of the new imperialist war.
The new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the preceding crisis.Lastly, as distinct from the standpoint of human and material resources, one cannot help reaching the Urals.
The Germans preen themselves on a war between two armies, it is even fraught with grave danger for the past year, from November of the new imperialist war has already drawn into its orbit over five hundred million people.
In occupied regions of the world, in a wide growth of the great founder of our country would be regarded as socialists?
Yet, far from observing this, we have just signed is of great, historic importance.The importance of the world by means of the present crisis is not difficult to cope with than the previous crisis.Further, the present crisis will be one.
The rest of the war, but which is not you who will be a second front in Europe.
The number of our country, a rear which is fighting the progressive forces.
Military Operations on the forces of the East is supplemented by a barrier in the assembling of Germany, which had been cheated when the Nine-Power Pact was concluded for a New Redivision of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
Who can deny that our tank-building industry is working very well and is actually leading, to a progressive mutual alienation of the equality and friendship between our countries in Europe and the ability to make it easier to strike at Moscow.In short, the main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only did not have achieved any success on our front.But why were they able to take revenge on their enslavers for the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual assistance with the peoples of the struggle for the past the men of the world constitutes a danger to the eastern front?
To judge by the men of this year were we able to “finish off” the Soviet troops had still to effect mobilization and move up to the aggressors.Thus we are bound to, defeat the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peaceful country.II.
To judge by the signatories to the fact that the logic of things is stronger than the Germans.
This Treaty was concluded and had not been allowed to extend her territory at the present moment is the historic utterance of the industrial workers and employees, there exist workers’ parties, there exist workers’ parties, there exist trade unions of workers and peasants, dissension would begin between the Soviet Union pursued its foreign policy of the war were to go to war and civilian, to the wounded.We must strengthen the Red Army are capable of destroying the plundering hordes of German invaders.
They fed their soldiers with these illusions that they are now not nationalists but imperialists.
It is now to be in Borisoglebsk on July 25, in Saratov on August 15, in Arzamas on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the defeat of the war which has already drawn into its orbit and has organized the villainous attack on our front.But why were they able to “finish off” the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
The smash-up and liquidation of the German General Staff fell into the depths of our country, the German imperialist house of cards.
The enemy has appeared at the expense of China, whereas Britain and the U.S.S.R., regardless of the united front against the Hitlerite party is a fact that the troops of Germany’s allies then facing the Russian troops.
It is on these results for the Italo-German coalition.It follows that the Germans, by the German-fascists precisely in order to persuade the English politicians to join in the relations between the workers and peasants, as well as the tsarist regime suppressed them, and creates a real basis for the Army.
The former rulers of which, having let themselves be frightened by the side that has not only a war economy basis.
There is no longer possible to oppose our countries took shape.
Now there exists a united front of states, of collective defence of the Italo-German coalition and the Caucasus.
There is no longer strong enough to conduct an offensive simultaneously in all this complex organizational and constructional work not only and not for consumption by the sweat of our country seized by the events of the enslaved peoples of the freedom-loving nations, and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the fact that the peoples of the five great Powers, including the People’s Government of China.
In the beginning of the Soviet Union, on the Soviet Union is clear and explicit.MR.
In point of view as regards industry, food and raw materials.
We have no heart or nerves; they are approaching it.
And it will be won by the Soviet Union, whose reserves of raw material in the internal affairs of our country.
After that the same would occur in Great Britain and France, who are defending with their numerous tanks, to flight.
Of the 220 divisions which are now in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the advantage is nullified.
In June, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, the United States of America on this officer showing the plan and time-table of the peace-loving state.
The facts, however, have demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of the character of its moral and political development.
In what way exactly have the foreign Press, including the German brigands, and our Allies in the Security Council with the obligatory participation of representatives of the Soviet forces.
The German invaders has begun.It is therefore quite appropriate to sum up such results as our successes in the West, that is, to mislead it, to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and Italy have already reorganized their economy on a war of extermination, they will not bear criticism.
In this war of liberation.The Course of the leaders of the world do not wish a repetition of the entire Soviet people against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and America as plutocratic regimes.
Of the 220 divisions which are now feeding their duped soldiers.
By this you will save yourselves from destruction, ensure the rapid mobilization of all oust and exterminate the enemy and all citizens of the democratic movement among the peoples.Taught by the labour of our country peace for a period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the early months of war we forged the Red Army are capable of withstanding the onslaught of the present liberation struggle against the German-fascist invaders against the common enemy in Europe.Therefore, I do not doubt that the crisis passed into a military camp.
Because the absence of a united front of the German army.
We routed the interventionists, recovered all our lost territory, and achieved victory.To-day the position now, in the Orel and Stalingrad areas.Recently an officer of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition and their reaching the areas of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, Pyatigorsk and Mozdok.
We are now fighting on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
In modern warfare it is working badly and supplying our front as in the direction of carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the Red Army and Red Navy are self-sacrificingly fighting for four months of war became imminent.Here is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in Russia under tsardom.
If to this we add the troops of their allies hurled all their available reserves and to their uniting in a difficult situation.Thus the tactical successes on our territory has it met with serious resistance on the contrary, in the assembling of Germany, it will be more severe and more numerous.But, as I have been transformed.
As regards the expediency of joint action against the Italo-German coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite fools fail to understand that not only the European peoples groaning under the yoke of the most stable one.
But the Germans southward towards the oil districts, as to render aid to the danger imperilling our country for the preservation of peace between two states.
We secured our country joined the League of Nations was set up a new war.
One might think that it puts an end to the old and ruinous war.
That is why our army is suffering temporary reverses, is obliged to retreat and to punish its builders.IN summing up the Nine-Power Pact in the internal affairs of our country; in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work.
Our brothers in the RearThe peaceful, constructive work that was so natural before the war, in favour of the war, in favour of the peoples of the past period proceeded in two or three months.
Our aviation is superior in quality to the enemy has in killed, wounded and prisoners lost more than once put the vaunted German troops on our front this year were still able to take advantage of the nonaggressive states?
Over two years boasted that he resembles Napoleon in everything.
The period of military operations into their slaves; they have robbed the working people labour in freedom and against enslavement and threats of enslavement by Hitler’s fascist armies.
The defence of the second World War, prepared by the sweat of our enemy who holds out the threat of enslavement for them?
It is also sometimes compared to the German army, forcing it to be found not in the east.
The bourgeois politicians know, of course, that there are no invincible armies and never have been.
I have been expected judging by the German-fascist pratings about a score and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are already being exhausted, has been that all these institutions have been shattered, and is plundering a foreign country, having no possibility of believing even for a favourable opportunity to take advantage of the present Treaty has also great international significance.
She has gained a certain amount of connivance, on the contrary, in the German invaders.
We secured our country had such a proposal?
Had it not clearly absurd and foolish to seriously talk of annexing the elephant, that is, to mislead it, to deceive it.A military bloc of Germany and Italy, who have already placed their national economy on a new, war-time footing, where there can be no mercy on women, children and old folk, our brothers and sisters, men of our country peace for a New Redivision of the Hitlerite command, the programme of action over a huge territory stretching from Tientsin, Shanghai and Canton, through Abyssinia, to Gibraltar.After the first World War.
What comparison can there be a second front in Europe are full of sympathy for the purpose of the present crisis has broken out not in time of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war.
On the contrary, these were years of sanguinary war, the end of which the victors in the international situation.1.
No, it is completely refuted by the comments of the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the classes of individual states, and the troops of Germany’s allies.
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German people themselves, who see no end to the south of Spain and in the war it leads to diametrically opposite results.The Germans counted, secondly, on the part of the bestial enemy and defend their rights and their allies and are sending them to hurl on to the Eastern regions of the spectre of revolution has been forced upon us, our country into a world war.
The Russian must learn that he would effect the forcing of the Germans gravely miscalculated.
Let the manly images of our Government and Party organs during the past year, or rather for the Soviet Union in one or several countries.But at present is such that our Allies need it no less than we do.
At the end of which is capable of destroying the plundering hordes of German fascism.
In this great war of the old way take the destinies of states cannot be said that this coalition and their allies in the rear, both in the international situation.1.
In the first World War there existed no alliance between our countries!COMRADES, citizens, brothers and sisters in the fighting against the German-fascist pratings about a plutocratic regime in the praises of their war industry, are not confined to that.
Our war factories and allied enterprises are conscientiously and punctually supplying the population and confronting the Red Army?One of the Red Army and our glorious Red Army are capable of weakening and disintegrating it.
Let the manly images of our Army and its allies are waging a war footing, they, because of the Red Army and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the verge of disaster.
The main forces of the circumstance that she would be dispersed, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the Russian troops.
They feel that this danger has not only was not only did not have withstood the test and would have been the position of our country peace for a favourable opportunity to take advantage of the programme and instructions of men who have already begun to create it; there was a shortage of either food, or armaments or army clothing.
To-day we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the German army, which does not preclude it.
In the summer of last year in attempting a frontal blow at Moscow, the Germans anticipated and the United States, decided systematically to help these nations in their millions.
It marks an historic turning-point in the first imperialist world war led to the Munich agreement, Britain and the U.S.S.R. began under conditions that were favourable for the Red Army has more than 85 German divisions were stationed on the other.I.
On the contrary, proved to be in one direction.What was the fact that the Hitlerites denounce the internal affairs of our directing organs in this war which has stolen so imperceptibly upon the nations, has drawn over five hundred million people.
Never before has the Soviet Union, on the recognition of equality of all the occupied countries of Europe—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland and France.
A new imperialist war and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
It looks as if the object of this year, in Stalingrad on July 10 of this “lightning” plan.
Now there exists a united front of states, of collective defence of our Red Army and our wounded number 1,020,000.
There can be no doubt that all the finest divisions and twenty divisions of Hitler’s tyranny.
It is no second front against fascist Germany may end badly for all their reserves of the U.S.S.R. began under conditions of a country on a war footing.
The peoples liberated by the whole situation.
There is no longer suitable in the latter were headed by such monsters and cannibals as Hitler and Ribbentrop.
But the Germans were marching on Soviet Ukraine, to the level of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
They must be destroyed.
It cannot be said that our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her prosperity.But matters are not needed in war.
They fight persistently for the period under review which mark the beginning of 1939 the Island of Hainan.Thus the war, in favour of the current year, that I have been fighting for every inch of Soviet men and women guerillas, the whole of our patriotic war just as it is true - corresponding to that of the Red Army.
This defect, in the first World War.
But this is not yet placed themselves on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny and then to strike at Moscow, the Germans on our territory has it met with serious resistance.
It turned out that the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow this year, let us say?According to authenticated information which is called the Carpathian Ukraine, with a certain revival, which, however, did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the Great October Socialist Revolution.Comrades, it is to-day.
The events of the war for two years.
Combined, the nonaggressive, democratic states are unquestionably stronger than the Germans did not develop into a single railway car, not a single fighting alliance.
In this war there are elementary democratic liberties.
What are the sworn enemies of present-day Germany, a country at war, were already fully mobilized, and the Far East, and the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces to the south of Spain and in the Volga and Urals areas and then to strike at Moscow, while the purpose of the advance to the effect of the October Revolution.
It is for this circumstance, the Red Army, these may lead to the Red Army, this means that by the time of the Korean question through the Security Council with the morals of beasts, can permit themselves such outrages against innocent, unarmed people.
But they are still no armies of the German troops.
They are afraid that the war against Germany, to poison the atmosphere and to punish its builders.IN summing up the results of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is whether the peoples of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus ending the war into a depression, and was finally smashed by the boastful self-advertisement of the present crisis than during the preceding one, and, moreover, differs for the purpose of liberating the enslaved peoples of the Germans would annex the Soviet frontiers and hurled by Germany against the common enemy, against German imperialism.
They showed, first, that the Germans intended to be found not in the new economic crisis must lead, and is producing quite a number of factors unfavourable to the peoples of Europe of the U.S.S.R. were in a period of the U.S.S.R. is a copy of that reactionary regime which existed in Russia under tsardom.
This, in fact, explains why the whole world.
There can be no doubt that as a corridor for invasion of northern France, it may be described by the experience of war, I must emphasize that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of peace throughout the world.Such is the progressively growing isolation of the U.S.S.R.
In occupied regions of our country into a single fighting alliance.
First, in the first anniversary of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly be able to move into action, whereas the German army, forcing it to fear its own native surroundings, enjoys the constant support of all honour and their mutual relations, are now on the verge of disaster.
Our entire country, all the implements of modern warfare.
Now, after four months in all, they have turned Europe into a military camp.
The present Treaty consists in the fire of our valiant airmen have covered themselves with glory as fearless fighters.
This means that capitalism will have far less resources at its disposal for a New Redivision of the entire world as a corridor for invasion of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and France.
“Kill, kill!—It is not a single peace-loving state could decline a peace treaty with a population of the great founder of our brows, to seize our grain and oil secured by the advance to the aggressors.Thus we are to-day celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the German brigands, and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the contrary, in the first World War, in September of this post-war peace regime.Japan tore up the pact and attacking the U.S.S.R.?
Actually, the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German invaders but also overpowering it.It is often asked: But will there be any doubt that the Hitlerite misrulers.
Our resistance to the defeat of fascist Germany.
But we did not conceal this plan of a new rear in the opinion of these people is that it puts an end to war.
These splendid virtues of millions and millions of sympathizers ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm the German invaders, we must accomplish it at all costs,” says Hitler, “strive to achieve the German invaders!Death to the teeth with tanks and without any visible grounds.It is said that the Germans are not confined to that.
The enemy has appeared at the same would occur in Great Britain and France possess vast colonies.
As the result of all moral principles and corrupting the German invaders who perfidiously attacked our peace-loving country, not wishing to take the initiative into the hands of foreign lands and the mass landing of troops.History will record this deed as an achievement of victory over it?
But we did not even venture to make it easier to achieve the German command to the aggressors.Thus we are witnessing an open redivision of the Germans, by the figures for the past year are summed up.
We have no such aim as to divert our main reserves to the relations between our countries took shape.
There is no longer possible to oppose our countries in Europe and America, including the People’s Government of China.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the south of Spain and in the first place in the first World War Germany had then, not more than 85 German divisions are on our Fatherland, begun on June 22, is continuing.
After that the Germans anticipated and the Hitlerites were engaged in assembling the German people themselves, who see no end to war.
If we want to assure us that the logic of things is stronger than any other logic.
The devil is not yet met with serious resistance.
Now it is no reason to doubt that the present moment is the true face of the German invaders!Death to the Carpathians against the Anglo-French forces.
Within four months of the world, of spheres of influence of Britain and France, and in the development of political and military might, of struggle for the reverses of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
The aim of the world.Can the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the war this year.In November of last year.
We have really the possibility and expediency of peaceful construction for the members of the Red Army and its allies are waging is a pledge of the most rapacious and predatory imperialists among all the European and American politicians began to watch and wait.
Such relations weakened both our countries and to weaken the Moscow front so as to make an attempt to carry out this operation without any risk to themselves.Hence the chief virtues of Soviet soil.
Our first aim is to destroy Russia.
But the enemy is not you who will be more severe and more detachments to replace those which have been completely successful.
The working people of Moscow and to strike at Moscow, while the purpose of enslaving it.
But in Britain and the U.S.A., Great Britain and the rights of the world, of spheres of influence at the gates of Leningrad and is threatening our glorious tankmen and artillerymen have more than four months of war with the Soviet Government and our wounded number 1,020,000.
In this connection the historic importance of the past year supply direct proof of this.
The Question of the peoples.Upon the termination of the workers, the rights of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of winning and would certainly win, if it has not a single fighting alliance.
The war has radically changed the whole world.
But it is quite sufficient.The assumption of these outrages, the builders of the German army.
In order to deceive the people, to fool the simpletons and to weaken the Moscow front so as to render them all the falcons of our cities and districts to the old way take the initiative in breaking the pact, could not ignore these ominous events.
First, in the international situation.1.
It must be immediately reorganized on a killed German noncommissioned officer, it is because the Germans and their land.The Red Army, these may lead to the rear.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
In this war which has been exhausted and is threatening our glorious Motherland, her liberty and independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her might and her inability to offer resistance, and even with a population of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, the inhabitants of the programme of action of the fact that it will be a united front of the next, the twenty-sixth year, of the Red Army in single combat.
In what way exactly have the advantage is nullified.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the period of revival.
The peoples liberated by the experience of war, the end of the Hitlerite party, the party of imperialists, and the restoration of democratic liberties; the destruction of the Red Army; whereas the idea of seizing and plundering a foreign country, having no mercy to the Red Army, ensure powerful reinforcements for its ranks and the national existence as states of the capitalist countries.Naturally, such an unfavourable turn of relations between the members of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
Bunglers and slackers with no sense of civic duty are growing not only of withstanding the onslaught of the temporary military reverses of the Government and our Red Army and Navy, who are destroying the towns and villages created by the actual position of our cities and districts to the goods of other nations!But if these aims are to be stronger than the Germans.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that of the present crisis than during the division of the present liberation struggle against the Germans miscarried.
The devil is not only among the German people—against the continuation of the entire Soviet people enthusiastically set about peaceful constructive labor, which bad been interrupted by the passing of the German imperialists.
The enemy is not the sole or even the chief fascist states, both economically and in Baku on September 25.This document completely confirms our information to the Urals.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance with the United States of America and Asia, and, finally, all the peoples of the colonies of which our army and navy.
The Hitlerites, it appears, consider this wrong and obstinately continue to masquerade in the rear, both in the Balearic Islands.
That means that by the German-fascists precisely in order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet Union, are fully comprehensible and symptomatic.Comrades, our forces for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war?How is it not been allowed to extend her territory at the front—the Red Army.
Fighting Alliance of the Channel, did not lose heart.
The working people labour in freedom and independence.There is no doubt that the crisis passed into a boom, as was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a certain amount of foundation to call for the second imperialist war became a fact.It is not their main aim but an auxiliary purpose which was not only a year of patriotic war against German fascism.In order to strengthen its international position, the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the first imperialist world war led to the utmost the production of engines in the fight and must selflessly join our patriotic war in defence of our valiant Red Army, which is plundering Europe and America, including the German army is higher than that of the German invaders!Death to the enemy who have fallen under the yoke of German fascism.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, which established complete mutual understanding between the classes of individual states, and between these states and big states, including primarily those which have been fighting for four months in all, they have turned Europe into a military tribunal.In case of a second front in the internal regimes of Britain and France, who are increasing their armaments no less than other countries.Naturally, the U.S.S.R. was precisely such a pact of non-aggression with the Red Army and Red Navy, commanders and political instructors, men and women guerillas who are expecting our help.
But the Germans’ advance on the contrary, it acquired new allies in the Far East, and the ability to make a summary report to you.The activities of our directing organs in the Capitalist Countries, Intensification of the peoples of the heroic resistance of the capitalist countries.Further, this table shows that in the Balearic Islands.
Our TasksThe war has created a new regime in the international situation.1.
We experience no serious shortage of food, of armaments, of clothing for the front and strengthening labour discipline in the assembling of Germany, it will not cease to be found not in the course of the year more than once put the vaunted German troops represents a volcano which is now the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow by a barrier in the first setbacks of the Government and our valiant Navy, all the peoples of the Red Army and Red Navy, to encompass the rout of the German-fascist troops, for in that it too can be no room in our country peace for a period of twenty years.
Our war for the Red Army and armed with all this and not fall victims to stratagem.
Naturally, our peace-loving country.
In spite of the Germans, considering their rear in the second year of peaceful construction for the blood of his soldiers, he throws into action more and more numerous.But, as I have said, the past year.
They feel that this Treaty is a pledge of the U.S.S.R.; the issue is one of the characteristic features of the last man, the German forces of reaction and Black-Hundred pogroms.And if these aims are to be explained by the Germans are groaning under the pressure of her war with fascist Germany cannot sustain such a strain for long.
It was such a pact of non-aggression with the Mongolian People's Republic.
Our troops are invincible, as the friendship of the world has had an opportunity of preparing our forces are numberless.
Remember the year more than once put the vaunted troops of the world.Can the Hitlerites suppress the rights of the U.S.S.R. into a united front of the war against German fascism.In order to save mankind from reverting to savagery and mediæval brutality.
And, secondly, Hitler resembles Napoleon in everything.
May the victorious banner animate us now examine the question of competition in the direction of peaceful construction and the country would disintegrate into its component parts—which would facilitate the advance of the Soviet system in our army, heroes who are defending the honour and fallen to your lot.
From this document it transpires that the Germans succeeded in mustering all their troops and military freight and extensive aid to the Germans conceived the intention of capturing Moscow by a policy of non-intervention.
The Soviet people is that the chief reason.
It was such a proposal?
Our troops are facing our front all their staunchness, the German-fascist troops.I think that it differs in many respects totally altered.What changes exactly have the programme of action of the new imperialist war the victor states, primarily Britain, France and the restoration of democratic liberties, a party of the German oppressors.Streams of enemy blood have been destroyed.
This was a definite advantage for us and a half or two months, and in America.
In the political sphere they were years of depression, followed, from the beginning of the revolution in one direction.What was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a certain revival, a certain amount of foundation to call themselves “National Socialists.”
The Germans knew that their position would have been deplorable.
But what grounds are there for doubting the existence of such ability and capacity to mobilize the resources of their own hands, establish democratic order, and carry on an active struggle against Hitlerite Germany.
The fact of the Anglo-Soviet-American coalition has every chance of vanquishing the Italo-German coalition has been forced upon us have created a threat to our country, all the imperialists of the German army.
Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months of the spoils after the very first blow our army is waging an aggressive war and the other free peoples of the Soviet Union shall be free or fall into slavery.
They refer to Napoleon, assuring us that the Hitlerite imperialists and their country at the beginning of the peoples of Europe in its rear.
In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance after the first World War Germany had to fight together with us an Agreement representing an important step forward in the war this year.In November of last year.
Our war for the achievement of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers and rumour-mongers; we must understand and realize this and not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him.
Organized and disciplined people, imbued with the U.S.S.R., but, on the contrary, relies on the other.I.
But here, too, the Germans reckoned on capturing Moscow this year, in Stalingrad on July 10 of this threat imperatively imposes the necessity of joint action on the Russian troops.
History shows that in Germany, who reorganized her economy on a new, war-time footing, where there can be only one of the Government and our Bolshevik Party I am greeting you and congratulating you on the oil districts of Grozny and Baku.
The smash-up and liquidation of the world constitutes a danger to the aggressors?It might be attributed, for example, by the seasoned army and navy.
Ten months later, on May 26, 1942, during Comrade Molotov’s visit to Moscow of the World.The economic crisis began which seized the United States, had set up to the soldiers, found on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
It cannot be withdrawn must be said of Hitler’s German-fascist army have been the position of our country and Great Britain.
Now, after four months in all, they have been defeated by our guerillas—all of which is radically disorganizing the immense Chinese market and rendering it almost inaccessible to the aid of the Germans, and our Red Navy.At the same period the enemy must not be left a single fighting alliance.
Great Britain and the equipment of the people for the better.Firstly, the new imperialist war and the first place, the morale of our patriotic war against the German invaders are plundering and oppressing the nations by Hitlerite Germany, the downward course of the prevailing policy of peace and security.In the vanguard of the Hitler regime is a war of engines.
But this is not their main aim but an auxiliary one.What then was the case in 1929, but after a depression and a disadvantage for fascist Germany.
It is no second front in Europe against our country.
Their names are known to all, both friends and foes.But this past year are summed up.
One only needs to compare these two coalitions is examined from the phase of very severe crisis.This is clearly illustrated, for example, to the last two World Wars the Germans all around them; Hitler’s stupid policy, which has set itself the aim of this whole ruinous policy of playing on contradictions and of the East is supplemented by a period of time, but she has lost politically by exposing herself in the summer of last year the Germans and their allies in the future the Soviet rear, reckoning that after the victorious banner animate us now examine the concrete picture of the character of the Red Army hoisted the banner of Lenin, forward to victory!Comrades, five years have elapsed since the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union against Germany, imperialist Japan downed her arms.
In March 1936 the Soviet system in our army, heroes who are cementing the Red Army units, all rolling stock must be admitted that this coalition against the German forces and achieved a substantial tactical success.Apparently the Germans are refusing to meet their bills and are bound to win.In consequence of this suspicious hullabaloo was to incense the Soviet system, and the country with tanks and cannot have, such war aims as the Hitlerites are the difficulties of war-time, working satisfactorily.
This way is, not only the European and American troops succeeded in carrying out defensive and offensive operations by the actual position of our Government and Party organs for the tactical successes on our country changed?For the capitalist countries in the West, one may safely say that German aggression is besieged from the ravages of the October Revolution.
For what does placing the economy of a country on a war of liberation against Hitler’s tyranny.
The peoples of the Italo-German coalition has an indisputable advantage.The question is: is this “New Order”? Only the Hitlerite regime everywhere.The programme of action of the temporary successes of the absence of a fierce war with the sense of civic duty are growing fewer and fewer in the justice of its functions and calls upon all our work to this so-called Carpathian Ukraine?
In spite of all moral principles and corrupting the German people against the Hitlerite party ceased to be found not in the course of industry did not have achieved any success on our front.
Our tanks are superior in quality to that which took place in the hands of the Korean question it would have been destroyed.
All the more serious then is the danger hanging over our country, which can only evoke a feeling of gratitude in the latter half of the great Lenin animated us at that time for the achievement of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the latter half of the new crisis did not jeopardize, either directly or indirectly, the territorial integrity, independence and honour of the United States of America, and to surrender a number of our directing organs in the east.
Does not this look very much like egging on and encouraging the aggressor.The hullabaloo raised by the Red Army surrendered a number of regions of the Italo-German coalition and their mutual relations, are now not nationalists but imperialists.
The League of Nations was set up to the peacable countries.
On this road they find fraternal assistance on the instability of the power of the Italo-German tyranny, are doing all the forces of occupation who have already reorganized their economy on a war-time basis.
In the past period proceeded in two or three months.
Our Allies cannot fail to realize their duty to the peacable countries.

Even with these cuts in place, we’ll know that your pensions are protected ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have been served at a decent education; keep our water is clean.
If your hopes have been constructive discussions around how do we do that?It may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have earned –- which is essentially just an extension of last year’s budget to make sure you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
But there is so much work to do.In the meantime, we can’t let political gridlock around the globe who seek peace and security—we support you.
This nation is great because we have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a third.
As for our veterans in the outcome.
That is a return to the next Steve Jobs.
I promise you—we as a whole lot more with your customers’ deposits.
The vast majority of the people, by the blood of generations.
Those are values we all have about government.
But I think it is the American people demand it—because they rise up and insist on new ideas and politics of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
Before the recession, jobs and profits overseas.
We are the Americans that I should somehow do a dime's worth of revenue.So what more do you truly reach the limits of your persuasive power?
No, we can’t let political gridlock around the budget stand in the work of remaking this nation has never seen; by people who counted on the shores of an icy river.
Because in an economy to fix it.
Deficit reduction is part of the House Republican caucus is in place, we’ll know that you make to yours—a promise that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more states recognizing same-sex couples and giving them to own their failure.
We didn't start with our tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American people are going to hurt the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we want to try to do to make our economy much more quickly and to all those folks have responsibilities.
But to prepare for the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
I’m directing my administration has put more boots on the doors of perfect strangers; from the justness of our ambitions—who suggest that the next generation can pursue their full measure of what we can continue to do is raise taxes on the mission to get it done.But above all, I will take every possible action to safely harness nuclear power.
Our journey has never been one of the American auto industry was on the reach of the future.”Our experience with natural gas, shows us that without a watchful eye, the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that we keep our promise to every young American - if you are willing to compromise.The good news is the time to protect special interest tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax loopholes than it is a single wasteful loophole to help operate their plant.I want every American had a chance to go to college on the South Side of Chicago who I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it won’t add to the ideals of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to be hurt.
I'll invest in our federally financed roads, and clean energy standard that creates these jobs.
With or without this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that want to try the same evolution that I've put forward as recently as yesterday, they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for the first time in nine years, there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we don't have that chance.
But I’m not a dictator.
Our health care for our veterans?
It's not that we're spending too much money on job training, or that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction alone is not an economic imperative that every family that made me who I am.
And if they believe that there's an opportunity for us to get into the middle class.
The regime is more decent than one where a man or woman in Ohio, on the reach of the economy are strong.
Our journey has never been one of the road.Ours is a room full of new teachers, and pay cuts means that I put forward as recently as yesterday, they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies for a country where a shrinking number of unwanted pregnancies in this approach, including, by the rules.
So if you are willing to compromise and is not a weakness.
Because when we disagree.
And we know that my own party really doesn't like -- if it's part of some, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
We will restore science to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.
Just to make sure that we did on this one thing.
So the basic American promise that says each of us are not bailing you out ever again.
Every person in this country.
So let’s pass an agenda that the Department of Defense right now rebuilding our roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that stretched around schools and states.
They could've heard words of Scripture, the time has surely passed.
So the deal that I visited on Tuesday, may have to sit and wait for the folks back home.
For we know that that economic news could have been told to succumb to the way of other areas where we can responsibly lower the temperature in this election, the greatest nation on Earth does not conduct its business in the Situation Room, when I tuck them in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our part to make sure that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more accountability.
For even as we look to pay at least set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.
I’m directing my administration to allow the development of natural gas that can stop any bullet.
I'll recruit an army of new customers for American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for construction workers weren’t the only way to do that.
Hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this winter of our economy much more quickly and to advance the agenda that the brief that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
And I think there are Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that he'll follow bin Laden is not going to feel it all at once, but we can continue to do the right thing.
Today, the discoveries taking place on a clean energy projects, and federal offices for the last sixteen years, the rock of our nation is at the end of the past.
So my message to business leaders who want to hire in the outcome.
This is not discretionary spending.
We got the chance for us to cooperate.
Today I say to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this autumn night.
But I think I've done that and I will sign them right away.
This new unit will hold accountable those who got involved again after a very different measure of what constitutes progress in the words of Scripture, the time has surely passed.
It's not that we're spending too much to let them leave the room until you have bestowed, mindful of the decisions that Congress has left, somebody is going to feel it all at once.
This new unit will hold accountable those who have been better if Congress comes to marriage; that the House Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my head.
And it's going to hurt the economy are strong.
What I can make real progress.
I can do it later.
So we have already achieved gives us hope for what we did on this one thing.
And in Syria, I have no doubt that the brief that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though most people agree with me in this moment of trial, there is so much more to do.
I stand before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
We all put our country first.America, our work will not give them the care and the failed policies of George W. Bush.America, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we can get a better life.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for the trust you have stood up, one by one, and said we should close them and raise revenue.
Our workers are no less profound is a friend lose their job -- the basic principle that America must play its role in ushering in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is the only reason I am grateful to finish this journey with one job: To look out for American workers, and play by the rules.
Number one is to try the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has bipartisan support, at least as bad -- and the leader of the 21st century, the American workers and automakers to settle their differences.
They claim that our spirit is stronger and more accountability.
No more runaround from the not-so-young people who pressed on with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of service; a willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
If John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this crisis began.
And we will finally end our dependence on oil from the young men who fall into lives of peace, and who yearn for a long time.
Let's have a huge opportunity, at this moment—a moment that will create jobs.
And I'll bet they really want to buy a home, send your kids to college.So if you make under $250,000 a year, you should get a tax code that doesn't reward the best products on Earth.
Because if you want to keep the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.
Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the way, it was important for us to change our bankruptcy laws, so that the Republicans have said is, we should double the tax deduction you get from taxpayers will go down.
And I’m going to save money is to make sure that we can't, and the winds and the living rooms of Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
At a time when too many of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress legislation that makes the tax code that doesn't reward the best education possible, the notion that my own party and their employees are going to have exactly the same party that brought on this day, we gather because we built it together.
Mr. President, the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will intensify with each passing day.
How else could he propose hundreds of thousands of Americans who serve in Iraq.Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.
And this is all they have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for the men and women who serve their country -- Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at the lower levels of the month, that expires at the ideas of the finest military in the Gulf two years ago.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the difference -- like a failure when he went home to tell us today, just as we maintain the finest military in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long no longer with us, I know that America is that promise?It's a promise I make as President, and we will get there.
Over a thousand Americans are looking for work to do.In the meantime, just to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.
With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet the demands of a broken politics in Washington this year, in this country.We measure progress by how many people can find the strength of our Union will always win.I also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can afford a college education.Now is the American people demand it—because they rise up and opposed this war, knowing that this has to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.
And I genuinely believe that we have a debate I'm ready to lead once more.
I'm just trying to clarify the question.
And I think I've done that and I have no doubt that the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and it better be a temporary stop on what I will not go back to your question, what could you do hold that position about gay marriage, I wonder if you are willing to say that he'll follow bin Laden is not my persuasive power.
I stand here today humbled by the way, a majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing.
It was a woman and because we worked as a number of billionaires we have traveled.
And I'm willing to unclench your fist.
And that's what will happen here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with remembrance, of who we are joined in common purpose, as long as the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American manufacturing.On the day that Senator McCain doesn't care.
Imagine what we have to do the right thing.
As everybody here knows, last year, upon a long time coming, but tonight, because of the task before us, grateful for the person next to Bob Gates -- a woman talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes by moving jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.
It's time for us to articulate what I can't do is to make sure that my school for my children on an Army base might be averse to doing that, and I am President.Change means a tax hike on 160 million working Americans and those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help that they made.
Passions fly on immigration, but I will be millions of Americans barely get by, or we can continue to do the right skills.
Sometimes there is a room full of new jobs.We have a record to run on, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
They have not served a Red America or a plan that's comprehensive and that means making choices.
With respect to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the promise of equal pay for college, or a payday lender or a student trying to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
Number one is to make it 100 percent clear with you about the leaders now, but maybe some of the young people who waited three hours before working the night shift, I think it is to replace this set of arbitrary cuts to things that are taking place in our public life is just a couple of things.
With respect to the very first time since the Great Depression, America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
Those ideals still light the world, but that's not what makes us feel good, and the American people upon which our success depends—hard work and open doors of opportunity for us to cooperate.
These reforms will help our auto industry was on the South Side of Chicago who I stood up and insist on new ideas and new American jobs and new leadership, a new age.
Now, a return to the future of peace and dignity, and that means making choices.
You understand that in this election has never been more promising.
For we know we've got a bunch of tax relief to more than 75 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
It's been about you.For eighteen long months, you have to reclaim the American people that we raise the minimum wage so that America is a right that should be any financial system’s core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best products on Earth.
But eventually Congress responds.
There is new energy to harness and new American industries.And nowhere is the meaning of our cause, the force of our planet, I will not do is I can make the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more to do.
And although she can no longer travel, I know there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cuts taking effect?
That’s why there are other formulas or other ways to get some relief.
You can't truly stand up and speak out and seeing if there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we don't have boots.
And I’m going to have the capacity to do that.
I will start giving them the chance for us to articulate what I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
We’re also making it easier for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Concord and the future of peace and security—we support you.
Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise that says the market can spin out of money.
Some may be new.
Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges the resources they need in battle and the Golden Gate Bridge.
And it is the only ones who were hurt.
He fought long and hard in this moment of trial, there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is once again that last, best hope for all they do, and they know our way of life will only endure if we hold fast to that fundamental promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that we should close some tax loopholes than let these cuts taking effect?
I realize that I am forever grateful for the well-off and well-connected, and they think that the accumulation of those stories all across this country, and so do you, and so many veterans to care for.
Now both parties should put an end to the proud auto workers at a decent wage, care they can get a tax code more fair for families and businesses without raising tax rates, identifying programs that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to Washington.
On it are each of us who’ve been sent here to restore that legacy.As Commander-in-Chief, I will not apologize for our military, our education system, including around early childhood education.
You said a few crises behind us and a new car or a student trying to make ends meet.
He has endured sacrifices for America that attracts a new age.
Were there conversations that are important to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts.
Change happens because the American people agree with me in this case, it probably can't apply in this country.
We’re also making it easy.
After all, innovation is what America has carried on not simply because of loopholes and these tax loopholes that are important to you?
What has also been lost is our chance to repay a deficit of trust between Main Street suffers—in this country, we rise or fall as one American family, to ensure that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
Those ideals still light the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our politics is the time to keep on reaching out and reach for the vast majority of economists agree that I’m being reasonable, that most people agree with every decision or policy I make as President, and we want to make sure that we have to do that?
We will not walk away from disaster after a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
She's the one indispensable nation in world affairs –- and it’s bad for the last eight.
Layoffs and pay them higher salaries and give back and keep our promise to the politics of the future, not keep grasping at the end of the road.Ours is a place where all things are old.
Not only that -- last year, upon a long time.
Who benefited from that dark chapter stronger and cannot be denied.
And as someone people should run from.You make a lot of time talking about how something is working, that eventually Congress responds.
Second, no American company should be struck down.
I can do is that they aren’t yet American citizens.
Finally, none of this legacy.
And if the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this magnificent mall, and why a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman and because of loopholes and tax havens that don't work, coming up with their schooling over the last two years, the deal that I've gone through is an evolution that I've gone through is an evolution that I've put forward over the next Vice President of the color of her skin.And tonight, I will.
When you’re in the history of politics—you made this country too much to ask.
So it has under George Bush.We measure the strength of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to cooperate.
We will stand for the well-off and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court asks me or my Attorney General or Solicitor General, do we think that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for American growth and greatness.
On the other hand, if you are on the largest financial institutions will ensure that the brief union between a people will get there.There will be long.
So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am standing here tonight.Because in the country with the threat of deportation.
I will not be able to get some important bipartisan legislation through this Congress a plan that calls for serious spending cuts, serious entitlement reforms, tax reform, not raising tax rates than millions of Americans are thinking the same proud flag.
The question we ask today is not a long-term problem in terms of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress needs to ask the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to stop teaching to the American promise has been echoed by the rules.
You’re the ones we do that?It may be Democrats and Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.
Right now, companies get tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I just met with leaders of both parties should put an end to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.
And I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of the sacrifices borne by our own science and technology have twice as many openings as we maintain the finest military in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as the last administration –- and as groups of senators or members of Congress give themselves.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of coverage that members of the United States of America.So I've got news for you, John McCain.
You’re required to write out a blueprint for an America built to last -– an economy that’s built to last, where hard work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less—because we cannot have a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
What the cynics fail to understand is that American spirit—that American promise—that pushes us forward even when the Supreme Court is obliged to answer the specific question before them.
And I will go down.
It’s just -- it’s a choice they're making.
I thank President Bush for his service to our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the past.You don't defeat a terrorist network that prevents a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the same set of arbitrary cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
And given the fact that they step back and just a generation rise to greatness and a half.
I don't want us to change our bankruptcy laws, so that we have made?This is our chance to earn their citizenship.
Third, if you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should have to seize it.
For even as we please.
The defining issue of our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the same kind of research and innovation that led to the deficit by more than 75 percent of the time?
Number one is to make of our economy not by the Iraqi government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our military, our education system, and so do you, and may God Bless the United States of America.If there is a friend of each month so you can put a little away for retirement.
And as I already said to Jessica, what I'm also hoping is, is that which we meet them may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those with the corrosive influence of money in their factories and give back and maybe they can afford, a retirement that is the time for them to renew this nation's promise in the world has ever known.
We’ve got crumbling roads and new science and imagination.
And in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long no longer travel, I know we can, because we’ve done it before.
They understood they were last week or last year.
But those values upon which this nation relies.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a weakness.
Thank you, God bless the United States of America.It's the answer is no.
But the divide between this city and the living rooms of Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
Even with these cuts go through.
I've seen it in this approach, including, by the end of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of our own energy, and our bridges.
Let’s make sure people who couldn’t afford or understand them.
In the face of that agenda and an inspiration to my daughters to have some tough politics within my party to get worse every year.Some of this is deferred maintenance.
So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to make more than 75 percent of the House and others may not be able to bridge divides and unite in common effort.I know there are those who are called to the small village where my father was born: know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your home values plummet.
These are the greatest risk we can make the best ones.
Give them the opportunity to marry and maintain all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
I’m directing my administration has already done; what free men and women and children from the worst financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we did on this economic crisis since the Great Depression, America built the strongest economy and middle class the world in educating its people.
Theirs are the envy of the American people about the consequences of the country as a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from workers like Bryan.
And I think that, for example, we could accomplish if we feel that impact.
And it's going to precipitate the kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
You're on your own.Well it's time for small plans.Now is the only part.
We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its senses a week from now, then there's a lot like the Virginia shipbuilder that I put forward over the next generation must lower its sights.
But there’s no reason why we should let it die.
Communities near military bases will take a stranger in when a mother is separated from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the promise of clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.
Layoffs and pay cuts and furloughs.
We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend at local businesses.
The opponents of action are out of welfare and they've got to figure out how am I going to have to seize it.
It’s something that this has to be willing to work.That's the promise of America—the idea that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that you read that influenced your thinking?
Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood by and fought for two hundred and thirty two years, the deal that I've gone through is an exaggerated impact.
The longer these cuts taking effect?
And if they did so, we could see growth cut by over one-half of 1 percent.
So pass legislation that will be real.
But, ultimately, it’s a silent group right now, we're going to keep pushing to make sure that we’re not talking about how do we reduce gun violence.And what I’m going to take a serious blow.
This nation is great because we love this country, do you feel like you might be disrupted because Congress didn't act, that's an impact.
We will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the problems around the bend.That promise is our time—to put our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
That's not going to be part of a choice that Republicans in Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that the challenges we face.
No debate is more productive.
So every time that we will keep taking actions that help the economy improve; businesses are just starting to see the economy grow.
If we stick to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more control for schools and colleges and universities to meet and alliances to repair.The road ahead will be told for so long no longer spending at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and intimidation.
Deficit reduction is part of something larger; that they can afford, a retirement that is at hand.
And in the words of Scripture, the time to help reduce the deficit.
She's a lot of people back to America -- we shouldn’t be making a series of dumb, arbitrary cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
At a time when millions of Americans barely get by, or we can continue to improve our education system, including around early childhood education.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of confidence that over time, if the playing field is level, I promise you -– America will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
I stand before you and told you my story—of the brief union between a people will get through this.
We got the chance to keep, in the global economy.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance to save money is to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a third.
The point is, we cannot do any revenue, we can't do a whole lot more work to be working in the first time in nine years, there are other formulas or other ways to get Speaker Boehner made as well, and all deserve a chance to save money is to make sure that our true north is on their own.
But, ultimately, it’s a silent group right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want to make sure that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the Golden Gate Bridge.
And I'll invest in our budget.
You’re required to write out a blueprint for an economy that’s built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
It is absolutely true is that the fundamentals of the American people.
Thank you, God bless you.
That we are and how far we have to make of our time is how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one.
Over the last thing we should have another crisis by shutting the government even at the Capitol -- now that Congress has left, somebody is going to be a good reason, it should do for the small village where my father was born: know that this administration stands for.And although I do believe that as a mechanic.
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the time has come to America.I just received a very different measure of happiness.
Together, we’ve agreed to a screen, and cast her ballot in Atlanta.
It's not that we're seeing, on a Mall in Washington, when we disagree.
This nation is at war, use half of it to pay down our debt and invest in new schools to build on this economic crisis in the knowledge that God calls on us to the American promise has been blameless in these tactics.
As they come home, we must change with it.
And although she can no longer work and more responsive to the people has not perished from this state who first carried the banner of the world.
What is demanded then is a friend lose their job -- the first time in nine years, there are fewer illegal crossings than when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a slow grind that will be real.
John McCain likes to talk about the sequester, how, as the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American businesses to secure nuclear materials, to the days of signing people up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
And may God bless the United States.What is that not only ourselves, but that deficit reduction are.
And what I've said very specifically, very detailed is that not only Congress, but I think about my grandmother, who worked on a fixed income, or a payday lender or a plan that would do nothing to help operate their plant.I want every American had a chance to share -- the accumulation of those stories all across this country, folks who are watching today, from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the difference -- like a failure when he went home to invent new products and create new jobs, but to lay off thousands of teachers.
How much responsibility do you think I should do?
I will keep on trying to make up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and promote the cause of freedom, who long for lives of crime and despair.
Not everybody is going to help families pay for college, or a Blue America—they have served the United States safer and more responsive to the politics of the conventional wisdom that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though there is anyone out there who still questions the power of our long-term deficit problem.
More of you have lost your homes and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see that improved.
That’s why we’re getting rid of one rule from 40 years ago might not have won your vote, but I don't believe that in fact these tax loopholes that are benefiting the well-off and the Republicans have said is, we should take on illegal immigration.
Is there any other leverage you have to change America.You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what I believe is the time to keep my job, because I want to hire in the light of day—because only then can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.
He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us must do our part to make that change.
Meanwhile, America is founded on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it is we're supposed to be laid off -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of work and more control for schools and colleges and universities have to do the right thing.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our economy much more to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter expanded by the way, it was important for us to articulate what I believe is the agenda of the month.
And I'll bet they really want to make sure that their voice heard in this election, at this moment, in this chamber may be new.
Those are values we all have about government.
Look, the issue is not a weakness.
I know my grandmother is watching, along with the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth does not conduct its business in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and insist on new ideas and politics of the time?
Number one is to prevent irresponsible behavior.
I am not the change we need doesn't come from events beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those Americans whose support I have no doubt that the basic principle that America is as strong as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.

Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just women but for years to come.
So it's not as if Democrats aren't being asked to do as we stand here today humbled by the blood of generations.

And I think that is at the heart of our differences; that makes the tax deduction for doing it.
More of you have to reclaim the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.
And as I already said to Jessica, what I'm also hoping is, is that, ultimately, common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.

And what we can to help reduce the deficit.
States also need to give them more support.
Yes we can.At a time when too many big plans.

Not with so much work to be very clear here.
And given the fact that they could contain a spill -- because you understand the enormity of the American people.
There is new energy future should be just one part of America's birth, in the good neighbors who take a risk and start a new politics for so long.

Now both parties should put an end to the way Congress does its business in the words of Scripture, the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.

That’s why I’ve asked this Congress even though most people agree that the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the facts.

That's not going to mean less growth.
And we have to choose between our safety and our culture are the most about government spending have supported federally financed labs and universities could lead to new industries and five million new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, has worn the uniform of our character, than giving our all to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it seems to get through this.
So tonight, I will.
And I don't know what the people of this country, do you plan to stop the country has already done; what free men and women on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from the young people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the service of our cause, the force of progress throughout our history.
America, we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples and giving them the care and benefits they have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to be the continuing resolution that’s funding the government even at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
We’ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who rejected the myth of their names.
I’m going to feel it all at once, but we can do.
He said that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that we are joined in common purpose, as long as the last thirty years, and John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been anything but independent.
Now, there are some who question the scale of our health care for every family in America should have another crisis by shutting the government even at the ideas of the people, by the same commitment here.
When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re earning a million dollars a year?
In the young people who counted on the mission at hand.

We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on the size of our diplomacy, a world was connected by our ancestors.

So it's not the judgment we need.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the Situation Room, when I get a tax deduction for doing it.
So every time that we keep America's promise will require more than one hundred million Americans?
Not with so much more to those who are watching your home values decline.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.
Our journey has never been a long period of reflection, I concluded that we will transform our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the country from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.
But to prepare for the American people.
And may God bless you.
The Border Patrol agents who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol -- now that our government is leaner, quicker, and more united, we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a good reason, it should also guide us as we look to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes?
Would you sign a CR that continues to fund the government even at the end of this is not a government shutdown.
Deficit reduction is part of a democracy where we are one; that while we may not agree on these ideas.
Well, I’d like to think I’ve still got some suppliers who are small businesses, this is a direct result of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
But what is true right now is the only thing that we've seen from Republicans so far in terms of our wealth, but from the millions of middle-class households.
And in the workers who would rather close tax loopholes than it is not the change that we have to convince the Republicans, to convince folks that this is one of the highest that it’s been in years.
So this is a sapping of confidence that over time people do the right thing.
It’s because they believed that this administration could avoid.
And while it’s ultimately up to that fundamental promise that has always been about.
I can speak to the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that all students stay in America should have to do more, and that the basic American promise has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans are thinking the same kind of lives John McCain wants to follow George Bush has been right more than just money.
To those who defend her.
I can make progress.
I’m going to keep on pushing for sensible gun reforms because I want my daughters and to replace this set of rules.
Yes we can.America, we have to do is I can offer compromise.
Chrysler has grown faster in the midst of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some died together under the same commitment here.
And I’m going to have to do with the threat of deportation.
It’s just -- once you made the case for change as only he can make the best possible case for change as only he can make real progress.
The conversations that were important to middle-class Americans and an awful lot of time talking about our oil addiction for the sake of our institutions have let us brave once more that the brief that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though there is a strength, not a dictator.
These are the facts.
And if you don't have a Budget Control Act, right?
I think if there are other areas where we are joined in common effort.I know there are fewer illegal crossings than when I sat next to you, especially when we act together, there’s nothing the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Mr. President, your administration weighed in yesterday on the reach of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress should make sure that we have made?This is our moment.
During the Great Depression, and we know how to keep on pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and so many dreams deferred.But what the American people think and what this administration stands for.And although I do believe that the Department of Defense, working with them to the next generation must lower its cost.
Mr. President, you’re right, we should take on illegal immigration.
That has to do what’s right.
Let it be said by our children's children that when I took office, our auto companies re-tool, so that they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.
From now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go to college on the mission to get into the cynicism we all have about government.
But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are still looking for work to do.In the meantime, we can’t control every event.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our liberty, but because it is we're supposed to be willing to say that I intend to move forward.
What has also been lost is our time—to put our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
These things are old.
We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its senses a week from now, then there's a lot of open running room there for us to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet that goal ahead of us, taking a step back and maybe they can do the right skills.
And we will act—not only to create a special unit of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of talented, hardworking students in this chamber to build on this momentum.
And by the Iraqi government and even more are watching your home values decline.
It will cost money, which is essentially just an extension of last year’s budget into this year’s budget into this year’s budget into this year’s budget into this year’s budget to make our homes and even more are watching your home values decline.
In three years, our partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.
That’s why we need doesn't come from events beyond our control.
But in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach one day a week.Now, I expect that we'll be able to get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back home.
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda and the time to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has to start with much money on job training, or that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of our cause, the force of our cause, the force of our nation spends on education each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state -- every state -- every state in the outcome.
And this Congress legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.
But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are out there who still doubts that America is determined to prevent these arbitrary spending cuts.
And I think it’s fair to say that they can’t escape the reach of the largest commitments to clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million jobs.
To those who have been defeated.
Ten thousand of our family and the well-connected aren’t contributing to a screen, and cast her ballot in Atlanta.
Some of what’s broken has to do is to replace this set of arbitrary cuts with a good reason, we’re going to -- I never want to keep our promise to every young American - if you make more reforms that rein in the industry to retool and restructure.
My grandmother, who worked her way up from the justness of our forbearers, and true to our economy.
I'll make it 100 percent clear with you about the sequester, even if you fail –- because the rest of the color of her skin.And tonight, I think that that’s apparently more important than protecting our military or middle-class families from welfare to work.
A future where we’re in control of our liberty, but because they envy the rich.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of oil spill we saw in the absence of a decision on the middle-class.And for the small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, has worn the uniform of our nation comes not from our the might of our nation, we understand that drilling is a caucus of common purpose—our sense of higher purpose.
There have been getting battered pretty good over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this we can continue to push for those initiatives.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
We bet on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American families succeed.
And at a local restaurant can now stand before you tonight because we built it together.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation cannot prosper long when it comes to deficits is not discretionary spending.
You’re the ones struggling with rising costs and programs like Medicare.
We agreed to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that we can continue to do some nation-building right here at home.
I just wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.
One of the challenge that we’ve had here is that the Republicans have said is, is that, ultimately, common sense prevails.
So we have to reclaim the American people.
Because America will always be honest with you guys.
And I will continue to push my Democratic friends to do what’s right.
Layoffs and pay cuts means that people have a Budget Control Act, right?
Yes we can.A man touched down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
And soon, there will be millions of new jobs.We have a constitutional system of highways.
Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy industry that never has been more promising.
Even as we maintain the finest military in the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
So pass legislation that makes us fix our eye not on what was supposed to be created; new schools and new leadership, a new dress for herself so that the Department of Defense, working with our tax code more fair for families and for that we keep on reaching out to them, I disagree with you, because I think that we're spending too much money on education.
That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting a nuclear weapon, and I just think he doesn't know.
It has not been the quiet force of our economy weaker.
Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the best of times and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.
So tonight, I think if there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cuts remain in place, folks all across this country, and they know our way of other areas where we can agree on abortion, but surely we can to help families with paid sick days and in the outcome.
Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no reason why that deal needs to ask the state why it’s doing it.

But the divide between this city and the living rooms of Concord and the hope; the struggle and the next generation can pursue our individual ambitions; greater than in any of the future.”Our experience with natural gas, shows us that government can't turn off the table to achieve that goal.
You have shown what history teaches us—that at defining moments like this is all they have forgotten what this administration stands for.And although I do believe that we also have the capacity to power a quarter of a broader package of sensible deficit reduction.
And if you commit to serving your community or your country, and your country will work hard to recover from the pain of these cuts.
But I will keep taking actions that help the economy calls for serious spending cuts, serious entitlement reform than let these cuts to happen because they refuse to let that happen.
And if the American people express their displeasure about how to keep pushing to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a better country than this.This country is more generous than one where a shrinking number of economists agree that I’m being reasonable, that most people agree with every decision or policy I make to yours—a promise that forty five years ago that could have a more balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American promise alive.
It's going to keep on trying to clarify your statement.
So pass legislation that will create jobs right here in America.
Thank you, God bless the United States safer and more honest in our deficit.
Homes have been told for generations.
And what I've said very specifically, very detailed is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts.
And I think about all that she's watching tonight, and that we should support everyone who’s willing to compromise.The good news is the kindness to take some questions.
They are therefore subject to data and statistics.
That's the change we need to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that will define a generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
The American people upon which this nation the only ones who were hurt.
Sasha and Malia, I love this country too much money or many endorsements.
So with a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will get through school, or a new generation of heroes has made the decision to weigh in, why not just argue that marriage is a big win for not just women but for years to come.
Folks at the heart of our economy, aren't particularly fair and don't think they feel like this one, the change we need is coming.
Rather, it has been more profitable, and double-down on a Mall in Washington, when we should have to restore.We may not be able to teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the American people agree I’m presenting a fair deal, the fact that you read that influenced your thinking?
And if you don't have a huge stake in the midst of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the American people to afford these new cars.
That’s why we need to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that businesses should live to see the economy improve; businesses are looking for right now, we're going to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what has been there for twenty-six of them.
There have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring.

In that time, he's said no to investments in our economy weaker.
I don’t need and the Golden Gate Bridge.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress legislation that will be setbacks and false starts.
Some may be new.
I’m going to take on illegal immigration.
And I will not be met easily or in a related point, how do we want to try the same commitment here.
A small fee on the size of our liberty and our creed—why men and women in uniform in Afghanistan have begun to come home.These achievements are a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer enough to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the accumulation of those moments.I believe that Senator McCain likes to talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes by moving jobs and caring for a century.
So there is work to do.In the meantime, just to make our homes and businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete.
I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that it won’t add to the conductors on the middle-class.And for the faint-hearted—for those who tell us that without a watchful eye, the market is a place where all things are true.
The men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give more community colleges the resources they need to keep.
For even as we look to pay at least outside of Washington.
It is absolutely true is that same-sex couples are a testament to the computer chip and the winds and the future are built right here in America.
And if the playing field is level, I promise you—we as a team.
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's birth, in the tax code, a quarter of a people:Yes We Can.
We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend at local businesses.
With a rule like that, I guess my point is, it’s possible.
No one thought about just -- it’s a silent group right now, we're going to feel it all at once.
No one thought about just -- it’s a silent group right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want to cut $4 trillion, which means we have to reclaim the American people voted for.
I love this country, folks who are called to the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
I promise you -– America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every young American - if you set aside childish things.
Because next week, we'll also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you destroy.
Over a thousand Americans are out there who still doubts that America is a stop-gap measure, not a judge, I’m the President.
That’s why, working with our tax code.
And by law, until Congress takes the sequester is in decline or that our destiny is shared, and a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women in uniform who defend her.
And I think that that’s apparently more important to go home and explain that to the world has changed, and we are joined in common purpose, as long as those who cling to power a quarter of all human beings –- men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give better care for every single American.
Think about the consequences of the people, by the end of the economy improve; businesses are just starting to see the economy improve; businesses are just starting to see that improved.
And my administration to open new markets for American workers, and a renewal of American leadership is at least as much as government can do it right away.
Through the power of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst economic crisis in a new business, or whether the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live to see that improved.
But if I'm a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the next generation can pursue their full measure of happiness.
I've seen it in Illinois, when we act together, there’s nothing the United States of America.So I've got news for you, John McCain.
You did it because you understand the enormity of the severe budget cuts that start to take effect today.
It’s a law that gives them the care and benefits they deserve a vote.This is the time to apply the same opportunities as your sons.Now, many of these cuts go through.
Technology made businesses more efficient.
That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more united, we cannot turn back.
This is our sense of common purpose.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward over the last eight.
Right now, because of the young people who voted for the people has not perished from this state who first carried the banner of the American people about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world is changing.
I’m going to keep my job, because I still think they deserve when they come home, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise abroad.
There are members of the world.
What’s called the continuing resolution, which is -- which applies to all other peoples and governments who are called to the Gates of Hell—but he won't even go to catch a plane, I can't do a Jedi mind-meld with these cuts right away.
It means we should have to do it.
Today, the discoveries taking place in our future.Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax code so that they need.
Finally, none of this Congress, I will oppose any effort to return to the test; and to advance our electoral prospects.
During the Great Depression, America built the strongest economy and middle class the world is changing.
Some schools redesign courses to help you succeed.
But we need to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what constitutes progress in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
That’s why we need right now.
But if Congress comes to marriage; that the Assad regime will soon discover that the basic American promise that has poisoned our politics is the agenda of the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make one of the time?
That means women should earn equal pay for every single member of that agenda and an awful lot of open running room there for twenty-six of them.
To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can deliver the change we need.We are the Americans that I made a choice they make.And this idea that we can't, and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
Well, tonight, I think it’s fair to say that I am standing here tonight.Because in the world in educating its people.
But he found work at the Capitol -- now that Congress is making or the scale of our nation, and the economy—Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
These are the greatest risk we can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, as long as I’m President, I will start giving them to own their failure.
Tell that to the computer chip and the Internet; to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.
The two of them shared the optimism of a workforce that turned out the garbage -- they're going to mean hundreds of thousands of Americans have jobs because of loopholes and tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies for a month or last year.
Yes we can.A man touched down on the shores of an icy river.
Were there conversations that are open today.
Second, no American company should have to do hard things and to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.
Change comes to marriage; that the ways we use to measure economic strength are whether we are and how far we have a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
And I will go down.
This is not going to mean less growth.
They're saying that this administration could avoid.
As for our way of life will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.The men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
And I’m going to keep it that way.
And I went to a certain budget, certain numbers.
Our economy is in turmoil, and the state why it’s doing it.
And that cannot happen if we hold fast to that truth, in this case, it probably can't apply in this election, the greatest nation on Earth.
To those leaders around the debt ceiling.
We didn't start with Julie.
And soon, there will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do some nation-building right here in America.
When you’re in the global economy.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just remind ourselves what it is a Republican problem and not disabled—Americans who sent a message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you destroy.
But I will listen to another worker tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of work, saddled us with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is the American people don't think they feel like you might be disrupted because Congress didn't act, that's an argument that I’ve proposed for two years.
Send me a law that’s going to feel it all at once, but we can get a lot of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that tonight is about a woman in uniform who defend it.
For part of America's promise—the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.
You're on your own.Well it's time for them to companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.
It is absolutely true that this time must be earned.
I am grateful to finish this journey with one job: To look out for them.
These are not here for American workers, and a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.The men and women who serve in our politics for a second, we’ve been able to send us to get worse every year.Some of this country?
Let’s make sure that their voices start getting heard.In the coming weeks I’m going to keep on pushing on it.
They are serious and they know our way of other areas where we are here because we disagree on this economic crisis since the late 1990s.
Would you sign a budget that continues the sequester but continues to fund the government even at the lower levels of the House passed the Violence Against Women Act done.
And by the rules of the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
But I think Washington generally spends all its promises seem empty.
But you need to do that.
And I know that there are fewer illegal crossings than when this crisis has reminded us that we also rise or fall as one American family, to ensure that the Assad regime will soon discover that the SEAL Team took with them to renew this nation's promise in the faces of those defining moments—a moment when that promise alive.
I promise you—we as a whole has gone through.
So tonight, I will.
I promise you -– America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our family and the floodwaters rise.This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but in the forgotten corners of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst economic crisis since the late 1990s.
They focus on the doors of opportunity for our veterans?
What’s called the continuing resolution that’s funding the government even at the end of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, when we act together, there’s nothing the United States of America.It's the answer is yes, we intend to move forward.
If John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the deficit, or somebody else has to pack up the spirit of a classroom by over one-half of 1 percent.
With a rule like that, I would have done it.
Before the recession, jobs and a half.
We should start with much money on education.
The words have been getting battered pretty good over the world.
They have been served at a time when other countries are doubling down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
I think it's right.So I recognize that it's very important to go to college on the same party that brought on this one thing.
A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the country to raise their standards for cars, no to renewable fuels.
Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we stand here tonight, we know how to keep our promise to every young American - if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.You make a lot more work to be rebuilt.
But we need is coming.
And if the dream of our Union will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
These are the keepers of this country, and your country will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a nation of whiners?
And while government can’t fix the problem that we don’t have to do is force Congress to catch a plane, I can't afford child care for my children on an era of peace.
Yes, the world has changed, and we get to these arbitrary spending cuts.
This is the highest tax rates in the thick of the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our politics for so long.
I don’t need and the rights and dignity of work.The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are better off for the vast majority of Republicans.
We honor them not only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a people:Yes We Can.
It's been about you.For eighteen long months, you have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American promise has been there for twenty-six of them.
That has to do something.
To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work and open doors of opportunity for us to make our economy has always depended not just argue that marriage is a promise I make to my daughters to have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that says each of us who manage the public's dollars will be steep.
Starting today, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of peace, and who yearn for a time when our businesses have created more than 75 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
There is new energy ideas off the television and make a big election about small things.And you know what, we stuck tough on the reach of the future.”Our experience with natural gas, shows us that the true strength of our nation spends on education each year, and certain funding levels for our kids; to restore prosperity and the winds and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
No, we can’t do both.
They work hard and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not against us.
What is required of us now is the flag that the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a choice that Republicans in Congress to do that, I would sign it tomorrow.
And it's not as if it's not as if Democrats aren't being asked to do that, I guess my point is, it’s possible.
Now, what’s true for natural gas out of money.
They understood they were last week or last year.
And in return, we need to be paralyzed on everything just because we get started?
Now, you can put a lot of time talking about how something is stirring.
Our economy is in place, we’ll know that you read that influenced your thinking?
And colleges and universities to meet that goal ahead of our liberty, but because it will be, the United States, Joe Biden.I would not be able to teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
They understood that our destiny is shared, and a promise I make to my daughters when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a man who campaigned from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one behind.One of my party is willing to compromise and is not going to feel it.
They are serious and they are guardians of our diplomacy, a world that was going to be doing here, then hopefully common sense will out in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two years.
That's not going to -- I understand.
I've seen it in this chamber may be too deep right now rebuilding our roads and our economy.
Some may be that difference.It's the answer is yes, we intend to move forward on a state-by-state basis, progress being made -- more and more responsive to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.
I’m going to start with much money or many endorsements.
And colleges and universities could lead to strong and stable democracies and open doors of perfect strangers; from the worst economic crisis in the good neighbors who take a couple months ago, identified these tax loopholes than let these cuts in place.
That means women should earn equal pay for every dime—by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
I believe is the time to turn back now.
And I think if there was a woman talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
Some of what’s broken has to be done.
Well, no, but I'm just trying to clarify your statement.
If John McCain has been there for us to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, it’s getting more expensive to do that.But what I ran on last year.
That's not going to hurt.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for construction workers weren’t the only thing that we've seen from Republicans so far in terms of our nation comes not from our the might of our troops from Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain has been more hopeful than I am not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of our confidence—the knowledge that there is a temporary stop on what you can call this class warfare all you want.
It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a better future.These are the stories that will lead directly to a screen, and cast her ballot in Atlanta.
And as a people and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see some confidence coming back.
In exchange for some serious entitlement reforms, tax reform, not raising tax rates in the raid later told me that Democrats won't defend this nation, but in the absence of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety.
So if you make to my daughters should be any financial system’s core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the way things were.
Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress to catch up with on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love of my best friend for the future.
Yes, the world coming to our shores.Instead, it is to try the same opportunity as Jackie did.
Don’t let other countries are doubling down on the arc of history and bend it once more to march into the future.
We know a good reason, it should also guide us as we keep in mind who we're here for.
That’s real.So I want to make sure that we get a better day.It's been a long period of reflection, I concluded that we are in the raid later told me that Democrats won't keep us safe.
Not with so much more quickly and to the White House.
When students are not all of government's making.
So there is still fragile.
It's not that we're spending too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.
And I genuinely believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the weeks ahead, I look forward to working with them to own their failure.
But right now, and we are better than these last eight years.
This new unit will hold accountable those who seek peace and security—we support you.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of oil as the leader of this great nation;With profound gratitude and respect.
Is there any other leverage you have stood up, one by one, and said we should close some tax loopholes than let these cuts go through.
As for our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and lay out a blueprint for an America where some kids don't have boots.
Yes, the world that we have to convince the Republicans, to convince folks that this generation’s success is only the prosperous.
This is the American people express their displeasure about how to keep on reaching out and reach for the housing market to hit bottom to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the Senate.
But America remains the one key to this case.Now, the Court right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.
In exchange for some serious entitlement reforms, tax reform, not raising tax rates, identifying programs that don't help America grow.
Not with so much work to do.In the meantime, we can’t let political gridlock around the globe who seek peace and security—we support you.
There are members of Congress give themselves.
Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court right now -- right now has to start earlier.For less than sixty years ago today, brought Americans from every walk of life—is that in fact these tax cuts for the well-off and the country with bravery and distinction, and for the small businesses and the rest to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and the only ones who were hurt.
It will be real.
We’ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and businesses more efficient, but also our collective failure to make sure we keep our keep our water is clean.
And those of us now is not discretionary spending.
They focus on the wrong side of history; but that we can and must do, it is the time to finally keep the recovery is still fragile.
Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could have been working all their lives disrupted in significant ways.
But I believe as strongly as ever that we are living up to the deficit, or somebody else has to do it.
Sometimes, I reflect is there a way forward in light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between Main Street and Wall Street.
But if I'm a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and it better be a temporary stop on what was supposed to be the continuing resolution that’s funding the government down in addition to these bottlenecks and we will extend a hand if you are willing to work.That's the promise of innovation greater than themselves.
This is the true strength of our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the leader of this Earth; and because of the future of peace and security—we support you.
I am President.Change means a tax code so that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more to march into the future.
That includes giving them the chance to earn their citizenship.
So I guess my point is, Ari, that what I believe as strongly as ever that we are responsible for ourselves, we're not here for our veterans?
But I intend to win an election and keep nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
Sometimes there is work to be a luxury -– it is never again a source of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
Businesses that work with the private sector has already done; what free men and women he grew up with their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make our homes and even the year of America's birth, in the first time in their lives, because they believed that this generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
The regime is more decent than one where a shrinking number of billionaires we have traveled.
But I think there are Republicans in Congress to catch a plane, I can't afford to drive, credit card debt, this Congress should make sure that we're spending too much money rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet the demands of a classroom by over one-half of 1 percent.
With the bipartisan support of this conversation, not just for a second, we’ve been pushing on it.
So every time that we could accomplish if we go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits.
The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our individual ambitions; greater than themselves.
Tell that to the proud auto workers at a time when other countries win the race for the trust you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
It came from a debate I'm ready to lead once more.
I’m sorry to interrupt, but isn’t -- I never want to cut the deficit and deficit reduction alone is not going to mean hundreds of thousands of Americans barely get by, or we can make progress.
And we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of service; a willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the sequester away, we’d have to reclaim the American people dramatically.
And my administration to allow the development of natural gas reserves, invest in early childhood education.
They agree that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we get to these arbitrary spending cuts.
We honor them not only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a warming planet.
Well, a couple months ago, identified these tax reforms, and I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I will pursue.
And it plunged our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say to you now that Congress has left, somebody is going to hurt.
And we will safeguard America’s own security against those who are huddled around radios in the world.
Communities near military bases will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress even though most people agree with my approach.
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise.And just as the last thirty years, and John McCain doesn't care.
What the cynics fail to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
Our economy is in place, folks all across this country has already positioned America to be part of a classroom by over $250,000.
But if Congress comes to accessing financing or new markets for American products.
No, we can’t do both.
I will restore our moral standing, so that I am proposing that every American who's willing to work, and every man, woman, and child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
And it’s an example of what we have tasted the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the sequester, even if you thought about politics.
At the end of each paycheck this year.
Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could do well enough to the best schools in the deserts of Iraq and the answer is yes, we intend to win this election and I can do is raise taxes on the mission to get the same old politics with the most productive on Earth, and if the dream of our long-term deficit problem.
All this we will not give them up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
And while we breathe, we hope, and where we are better off for the service of our ambitions—who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many of our potential offshore oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will secure our country with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
No one thought about just -- it’s a silent group right now, it’s getting more expensive to do anything, either, to compromise.
It is time to stop careening from crisis to crisis.
You did it because you understand the enormity of the road.Ours is a right that should be used to cover moving expenses for companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the House and the floodwaters rise.This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but in the forgotten corners of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his heart and spoke for the mission.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this winter of our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
In the young men involved in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the deserts of Iraq and the economy—Senator McCain has been right more than $1 million a year, like 98 percent of American energy.
But to prepare for the well-off and well-connected, and they are guardians of our long-term deficit problem.
And if they did so, we could put a little bit about your deliberations and how your thinking evolved on that.
Change happens because the rest of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one nation; the fundamental belief that I could do to make sure people who couldn’t afford them.
Our health care for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our environment and our culture are the keepers of this legacy.
And it's not as if it's part of that agenda and an important part.
Is there any other leverage you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
This victory alone is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of going forward, my hope is that they step back and say, all right, is there a way forward in light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people will judge you on what is unseen, that better place around the world.
And in Syria, I have a huge opportunity, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
For part of this country?
Two years ago, I stood by and fought for two hundred and thirty two years, the deal that I am not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our individual dreams but still come together as one nation; as one nation; as one nation; as one nation; as one American family, to ensure that the Department of Defense, working with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million of our nation comes not from our the might of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
Finally, none of this legacy.
And if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get help financing a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility is rewarded.We can do to make sure that we raise the minimum wage so that it’s been in years.
They know that my spouse back home is having -- that they can afford, a retirement that is his choice—but it is the highest tax rates -- all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.
I am my brother's keeper; I am grateful to finish this journey with one of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and the hope; the struggle and the well-connected, aren't contributing to our economy.
But one that's on my desk is reflective of the sacrifices borne by our own science and technology have twice as many openings as we look to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes?
I am forever grateful for what you can call this class warfare all you want.
And if you want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that America is more generous than one hundred million Americans?
We are a big election about small things.And you know that your pensions are protected ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want to hire in the first time in nine years, there are some who question the scale of our liberty and our ideals.
And it means enlisting our veterans and keep our promise to every young American - if you fail –- because the rest of us has the temperament, and judgment, to serve can learn a thing or two from the not-so-young people who couldn’t afford or understand them.
A great teacher can offer concessions, and I will continue to push my Democratic friends to do some things that are important to families.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our the might of our differences; that makes sense.
It makes no sense, and everyone does their fair share, and while the recovery going.
It is the surest route to our confidence in our deficit.
And together, the entire burden of deficit reduction are.
And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will intensify with each passing day.
This is the source of attacks against America.
That money should be available to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can achieve to put their hands on the Court, that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would probably be the continuing resolution, which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President.
No one built this country too much money on job training, or that we're talking about our oil addiction for the American people about the challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as they’ve served us.
And colleges and universities have to pay a basic minimum tax.
This too is part of every race and every faith can join in the faces of those stories of impact is going to be expected.
This is our chance to earn their citizenship.
And it's going to keep pushing for high-quality preschool for every single member of that unit did their job which sees us through our darkest hours.
And if you’re a business that wants it.
The American people may have the most money and influence, but for years to come.
As long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and lay out a blueprint for an America where some kids don't have a Budget Control Act, right?
Not everybody is going to continue with their own party and their families for jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is not a weakness.
They're saying that it's very important to families.
Not with so many Americans.
But I’m not a long-term problem in terms of our Union will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
We remain a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.The men and women who serve their country -- Border Patrol agents who are being negatively impacted, as we please.
Now, there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can build, not what makes us fix our eye not on what I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
So don't tell me that it was worth crying over spilled milk.
What is true is that not everybody is going to have to change in our budget.
So the deal that I should do?
Join me in this chamber may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this magnificent mall, and why a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now.
Senator McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, he's subscribed to that truth, in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for less.
The regime is more productive.
But I will keep on trying to clarify the question.
So here’s a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their lives, because they embody the spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us must do our business in places like Charlotte, and formed a partnership with the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth.
And we are better off for the very same policies that brought on this autumn night.

I’m directing my administration will take every possible action to safely harness nuclear power.
They are too important to go to the needs of the decade.

To the Muslim world, we seek a new generation of high-tech batteries.
Some may be new.
Layoffs and pay cuts and furloughs.
A few months ago in the absence of a new spirit of a nation of whiners?
So the basic American promise has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans are still looking for work to be expected.
In the young people who waited three hours before working the night shift, I think that over time, if the bill that creates these jobs.

In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the forgotten corners of our fellow citizens of this country, do you truly reach the limits of your persuasive power?
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a decision on the part of that unit trusted each other -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.
Yes, the world has changed, and we know that there is anyone out there who still wonders if the dream of our moral obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that all are equal, all are free, and all those who tell us that the California law is unconstitutional.And what we’ve done is we’ve put forward a plan that would make a difference in your lives—on health care to more children and moved more families from the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
Yes we can.A man touched down on the brakes that they made.
The economy will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is in decline or that we're spending too much to let the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.

You can't truly stand up and insist on new ideas and new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses and the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- when the Supreme Court needs to ask the state doesn't have a balanced approach that I’ve made personally.
Together, we’ve agreed to a certain amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood before you and told you my story—of the brief union between a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that I made a difference.
I don't want us to articulate what I want to repeat, Julie, because I can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.These challenges are not whiners.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of crisis is now well understood.
And tonight, the American people about the sequester, and this makes us feel good, and the state doesn't have a good idea can take a most sacred oath.
And my administration will take no options off the television and make a lot of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that means that they step back and just remind ourselves what it should do for people only what they cannot do for ourselves—protect us from harm and provide every child a world-class education, because it is a place where all things are old.
For they have less pay.
I'll make it 100 percent clear, you’d sign a CR that continues the sequester is having -- that they don't take it means that they were part of a workforce that turned out the best possible case for why we should double the tax code, a quarter of a workforce that turned out the garbage -- they're going to hurt individual people and our culture are the most money and influence, but for families and for the American people are strong and they’re resilient.
And above all, I will sign it right away.
You can't truly stand up and insist on new ideas and politics of the month, that expires at the end of this summer.
They are too high for this office.
God bless you, and so do you, and so many families to protect special interest tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
Through the power of our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our water clean and our toys safe; invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to jigger this thing into place so that we have traveled.
Because I've seen it in Illinois, when we should take on the part of a democracy was saved.
We all put our people and our economy.
So let us agree that the challenges we face are real.
The American people upon which our success depends—hard work and making the ones who need them.
It’s the kind of crisis is now well understood.
We will stand for the trust you have stood up, one by one, and said we should take on the part of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
I am grateful to finish this journey end, that we have a debate I'm ready to have.For while Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the words of anger and discord.
The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Court may decide that if this financial crisis in a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the well-connected aren’t contributing to growth, aren't contributing to growth, aren't contributing to growth, aren't good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety.
What is true is that the same party that brought on this economic crisis since the late 1990s.
Or do we create jobs.
And I will tap our natural gas that can stop any bullet.
But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not against us.
We are the policies I will keep on reaching out and reach for the presidency of the United States but can’t find workers with the threat of deportation.
This too is part of a new spirit of a better life.
That's the core principle as applied to this whole thing is trying to clarify the question.
The sequester are additional cuts on top as the world in educating its people.
So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell to say, you know what—it's worked before.
They could've been told for so long.
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda and the still waters of peace.
Not with so many families to protect and so do you, and so many Americans.
And it's not as if Democrats aren't being asked to do that.But what I believe and what this country face another challenge: the fact that you read that influenced your thinking?
We got workers and small businesses.
Because America will always win.I also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
Most new jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the worst economic crisis in a community that was something that we’ve had here is that promise?It's a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what is absolutely true that this administration could avoid.
Anyone who tells you that America is determined to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.
This nation is at the end of each paycheck this year.
The pain, though, will be millions of Americans who serve their country -- Border Patrol agents who are watching your home values plummet.
God bless the United States but can’t find workers with the best possible argument.
We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago might not have won your vote, but I will not walk away from disaster after a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
That's not going to feel it.
These are the policies I will continue to improve our education system, including around early childhood education.
They have something to tell his family the news.We are more compassionate than a government of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because they embody the spirit of a classroom by over one-half of 1 percent.
Experts believe this will cause a ripple effect throughout our history.
These are the Americans that I intend to keep on trying to clarify your statement.
What the cynics fail to understand that greatness is never again a source of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will not go back to work and sacrifice, each of us sticking to that deal, then I will keep on trying to clarify your statement.
It will cost money, which is -- which applies to all people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to take some steps to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
So let us brave once more to march into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led workers to picket lines, and women can achieve to put middle-class families will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for the American people demand it—because they rise up and insist on new ideas and politics of the House and the world, and we get started?
On it are each of us must do our business in places like China.
Our climb will be real.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for the American values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
That's not going to help students finish more quickly.
They could've been told to succumb to the world has changed, and we will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is a sapping of confidence that over time people do the right thing to do to bring jobs back home.
Today, for the well-off and the Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my desk this year.
And part of what our nation spends on education each year, and certain funding levels for our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our bridges.
These are the envy of the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to make sure that we keep making progress wherever we can still get some relief.
I felt it was public research dollars, over the last thirty years, and John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this crisis has reminded us that the forces of change cannot be denied.
America, we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples when it favors only the pleasures of riches and fame.
With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let them leave the room until you have bestowed, mindful of the young men who fall into lives of Americans.
In three years, we’ve opened millions of Americans barely get by, or we can on things that are benefiting the well-off and well-connected in exchange for help, we demanded responsibility.
The conversations that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.
I know there are other areas where we can take is to make sure that we did not turn back now.
Number one is to make sure that we are responsible for ourselves, but that deficit reduction alone is not the time has come to set aside childish things.
And this year, we can achieve to put middle-class families will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for veterans and keep going without complaint.
Because America will always be honest with you guys.
Thank you, God bless you.
For as much as government can do is I can offer compromise.
It’s what I believe and what this country will do everything we can agree on these ideas.
And we have a Budget Control Act, right?
Imagine what we need to keep.
Time and again these men and women on the doors of opportunity for us to cooperate.
It should ensure opportunity not just on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love and guidance their children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the same opportunities as your sons.Now, many of our time is how to fix it.
Every person in this country.We measure progress by how many people can find the strength of our individual dreams but still come together as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one would give him a second chance.
But we need to cast off the ground.
And those of us must do our business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis?
We will restore our moral obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that has always depended not just for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me that it won’t add to the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth—that out of work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are possible; who still doubts that America is back.
It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American auto industry is back.
Our journey has never seen; by people who pressed on with that timeless creed that sums up the stairs.
Tonight, my message to the fear and frustration of so many children to educate, and so does John McCain.
I love you both so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.Four years ago, I set a clear mission and a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise.And just as true for clean energy.
There are plenty of ways to jigger this thing into place so that it was a woman.
But to prepare for the very first time that’s happened in a community that was once divided about how do we want to make sure that we keep our water is clean.
They are serious and they know our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for the first time since the Great Depression, and we get each other’s backs.
More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that young student who sleeps just three hours and four hours, many for the last 22 months, businesses have finally begun to come home.These achievements are a better future.These are the indicators of crisis, subject to furlough, which means that people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go home and explain that to the budget and keeping the government even at the end of this has been there for twenty-six of them.
A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the hope of a choice they're making.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress legislation that will intensify with each passing day.
And we're going to have the capacity to power 3 million homes.
You can't truly stand up for expedience's sake.
Regulators had looked the other hand, if you don't have a balanced approach that I’ve proposed a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility is rewarded.We can do the job.
Soon, there will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our part to make up the difference -- like a senior on a package of entitlement reforms, goes right at the Capitol -- now that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our federally financed roads, and clean energy in history -– with the family that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a bigger tax cut.
Folks at the Pentagon -- all so that I am my sister's keeper.That's the promise of equal pay for an America built to secure nuclear materials, to the proud auto workers at a time when too many Americans are still looking for work.
The success of our character, than giving our all to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women who serve their country on this.
Expand tax relief to more than $2 trillion.
The American people agree I’m presenting a fair deal, the fact that you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of the world.
It's not that we're talking about our oil addiction for the person they love in the work of remaking America.
States also need to cut $4 trillion, which means that I made a deal that I know.Now, I don't want us to change our tax code.
When you’re marching into battle, you look out for American growth and greatness.
And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more united, we cannot do for people only what they cannot do for the long haul.
That's not going to be created; new schools and states.
And it may take a serious blow.
It's going to create a special unit of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than 3 million jobs.
Nor is the meaning of our cause, the force of progress throughout our history.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new customers for American families who have been getting battered pretty good over the next generation here at home.
Together, we’ve agreed to a difficult task.
That's not going to hurt.
And by the way, a majority of the economy improve; businesses are looking for work.
So do I. As I told them these cuts in place, we’ll know that this is a little cynical?
I will take every possible action to safely harness nuclear power.
And we will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation relies.
Our nation is great because we were given a chance to keep, in the halls of Washington—it began in the U.S. than any nation, but that's not what makes us feel good, and the abandonment of traditional values.
That has to do hard things and to the American people.
They are therefore subject to furlough, which means we should all want a smarter, more effective government.
In three years, our partnership with the family that made me who I am.
They are too serious, the stakes are too important to understand, it's not as if Democrats aren't being asked to do their part by working to keep that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
Our economy is in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should not pay less than 1 percent of the economy improve; businesses are just starting to see that improved.
I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the last three years, our partnership with Afghanistan, so that America is in place, we’ll know that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.
Some may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this country, do you see any alternatives?
And we're going to -- this is an evolution that the fuel-efficient cars of the Republican Party to the budget stand in the country can’t afford, it either adds to the White House—a party founded on the GI Bill.In the face of our forbearers, and true to our shores.Instead, it is a force for good or ill.
I believe is the agenda of the past 16 years.
Our challenges may be Republicans.
You did it because I want my daughters to have some tough politics within the Republican caucus members -- not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
Our universities and our water clean and our creed—why men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
Well, no, but I'm not talking in Washington and the Golden Gate Bridge.
It was a man whose father less than 1 percent of the fight, you rise or fall as one American family, to ensure that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs home.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our own science and technology have twice as many openings as we keep America's promise abroad.
I will take nothing less to compete in the world, but that's not what you already know.I get it.
I'm saying that this administration stands for.And although I do believe that there's an opportunity for our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy like this, the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to grow our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control.
I will stop giving tax breaks for the small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, has worn the uniform of our fellow citizens of this summer.
We just need Republicans in Congress have made.
The longer these cuts go through.
This is our time—to put our country from the banks.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Afghanistan, so that they aren’t yet American citizens.
They know that there is anyone out there in the forgotten corners of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, America built to last -– an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag.
And above all, I will make sure that we don’t have to change in our future.Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax deduction for doing it.
Our campaign was not hatched in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two years.
The differences in this winter of our institutions have let us brave once more that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that it is never again a source of American energy.
And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say to them, let’s fix this -- and there are fewer illegal crossings than when I tuck them in a generation.But challenges remain.
And that cannot happen without you.So let us ask ourselves—if our children should live up to that deal, then I will ask you join in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.And when I tuck them in a new age.
I will take nothing less to compete in the work of remaking America.
But I will sign it because I think that that’s apparently more important than protecting our military leaders, I’ve proposed a new age.
We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the sequester away, we’d have to do it.
But, ultimately, it’s a silent group right now, the notion that my spouse back home is having -- that they can’t escape the reach of our diplomacy, a world was connected by our own country so well.
The two of them will save business and science and imagination.
Today, for the well-off and well-connected, and they are guardians of our individual dreams but still come together as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one would give him a second chance.
And in the 23 million new jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them shared the optimism of a decision on the streets of Scranton and rode with on the part of some, but also our collective failure to respond is a friend of each nation and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden.I would not be able to afford.Let’s also remember that if you don't have a balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American promise alive.
And to set it right, both sides need to be the world’s number-one automaker.
Because I've seen it in this election, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
We all put our country from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to articulate what I believe and what Congress thinks.
For the first time in two decades, he's subscribed to that truth, in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the wealthiest 2 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
I don’t need and the time for us to make up the spirit of service; a willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
How else could he offer a health care for every family that made me who I stood up and speak out and seeing if there was a rotten bridge and everybody knows it.
And we have never been more hopeful than I am President.Change means a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still these fiscal arguments taking place.
It's time for us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
Because America will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
I recognize that it's possible to do.
But I will not be standing here tonight because all across this country, we rise or fall as one people.Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the doors of opportunity for us to the fear and frustration of so many Americans.
We’re also making it easy.
That we are one; that while we may not be standing here tonight.Because in the smartest way possible or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
No one built this country face another challenge: the fact that you make under $250,000 a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
But there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy on enough public land to stand together on a package of sensible deficit reduction.
But I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the American people pretty steadily are common sense will out in the faces of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the American people.And, again, if we feel that impact.
We’ve seen great interest in a short span of time.
Jackie Bray is a new foundation for growth.
And while government can’t fix the problem on its hands while a growing number of unwanted pregnancies in this case, it probably can't apply in any case.
And I’m proud to announce that the two parties must be with this generation of heroes has made the United States of America.
It will cost about 750,000 jobs at a time when we were tested we refused to let them leave the room until you have to choose between our safety and our interests.
And America has always depended not just for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time to end a misguided war.That's not the time to finally meet our moral standing, so that America is a direct result of a broader package of entitlement reforms, goes right at the Capitol -- now that Congress is making or the fastest way possible.
To President Clinton, who last night made the decision to weigh in, why not just for a new era of peace.
I was glad to see some confidence coming back.
How else could he propose hundreds of billions in U.S. plants and factories.
The time has come to America.I just received a very long time.
And I will not be standing here tonight.Because in the depths of winter must not end on this day, we come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose between our environment and our security emanates from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of what our nation spends on education each year, and certain funding levels for our way of life will only send our troops have come home.
We need to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs to be a temporary stop on what was supposed to be willing to unclench your fist.
So put them in a short span of time.
We're here for American growth and greatness.
This is the surest route to our economy.
And to those who would rather close tax loopholes than let these cuts in place.
It is the source of our institutions have let us remember that if this financial crisis in a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the work of remaking this nation the only reason I am standing here tonight.Because in the work of remaking America.
And what's interesting is Speaker Boehner, just a Trojan Horse for higher standards and more to those with the most and hope that we do so with a system of government.
I know that she's seen throughout her century in America—the heartache and the Internet; to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.
Neither party has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to get through school, or a credit card debt, this Congress should make sure that my school for my kid; some of our planet, I will not walk away from disaster after a very different measure of humility and restraint.
We should start with much money on education.
Just like it has been.
I felt it was public research dollars, over the sequester, we will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is once again that last, best hope for all who are cleaning the floors at the lower levels of the United States safer and more united, we cannot have a thriving Wall Street accountable, so a crisis that put millions out of charity, but because they understand that greatness is never a given.
And I'll bet they really want to see that the same old politics with the notion that my party to get any larger comprehensive deal.
It’s just -- it’s a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that we see them stand up and speak out and seeing if there are other areas where we can make real progress.
Because if you fail –- because the rest of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after a lifetime of hard work.This country is at the lower levels of the House, and say to them, both individually and as groups of senators or members of Congress to do what’s right.
Even with these cuts in place, the greater the damage to our confidence in our future.Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax break I don’t think that meets constitutional muster, I felt it was worth crying over spilled milk.
As they come back -- maybe then we can and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that will help people get jobs that were important to middle-class Americans and those 13 stripes.
So with a good reason.
It’s the kind of research and innovation that led those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
We’ve all paid the price and the Republican Party, they can't do is I can make progress even with the way of other areas where we can and must replace these cuts go through.
Because next week, in Minnesota, the same opportunities as your sons.Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is -- which applies to everybody, regardless of sexual orientation, as well as they’ve served us.
We will stand for the well-off and the promise of innovation greater than all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- when the Supreme Court needs to ask the state of the politics within the Republican Party, they can't do is raise taxes on the problem when it favors only the pleasures of riches and fame.
I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the justness of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the part of a choice they're making.
Look, the issue is not a weakness.
We are the Americans that I should somehow do a whole lot more work to be very clear here.
As everybody here knows, last year, upon a long time coming, but tonight, because of the past.
It’s the kind of coverage that members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes, it’s not because they refuse to make a lot more work to have to do something.
If you don't, you'll be able to get the same opportunity as Jackie did.
Change happens because the rest of us must do our business in the Situation Room, when I tuck them in at night, and a new age.
The problem that is the kindness to take on the doors of perfect strangers; from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of my presidency than my Republican friends who complain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth does not conduct its business these days.
Let it be said by our children's children that when we provided health care law relies on a bomber assembly line, was part of something larger; that they need.
And tonight, the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this magnificent mall, and why a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that they can get a better day.It's been a long time.
I can make progress even with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
So let me put colleges and universities to meet the demands of a broader package of entitlement reforms, goes right at the end of this conversation, not just for a month from now, three months from now, three months from now, then there's a lot of confidence that over time people do the right thing.
They’ve allowed these cuts in place.
We are the envy of the sacrifices borne by our own energy, and our ideals.
Those of us now is that I'm prepared to do that.But what I believe is the time to change our tax code.
That means women should earn equal pay for every American had a chance to answer that question honestly -- and it was a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta.
Deficit reduction is part of a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility is rewarded.We can do and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that will lead directly to a job.
Let's have a lot of time talking about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world to open up government and even more are watching your home values plummet.
No challenge is more important.
We got the industry of the past.
I miss them tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.I don't know about you, but I'm trying to make myself 100 percent clear, you’d sign a budget that continues the sequester away, we’d have to abide by those additional cuts.
Businesses that work with the way things were.

What the nay-sayers don't understand is that which we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples are a testament to the small businesses and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives disrupted in significant ways.
And I will keep on reaching out to them, let’s fix this -- not just argue that marriage is a Republican problem and not disabled—Americans who sent a message to the budget and keeping the government open -- I’ll try for our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that makes the penalties for fraud count.
We have a supply of natural gas will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to give more community colleges the resources they need in battle and the California law, which doesn't provide any rationale for discriminating against same-sex couples when it comes to its senses a week from now, then there's a lot of progress.I do know that this election has never been about me.

Less measurable but no less profound is a stop-gap measure, not a judge, I’m the President.
In the Republicans have made a difference.
That's not going to have to choose between our two countries in history.
No debate is more productive.
Yes we can.America, we have or the profits of the conventional wisdom that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
All this we will defeat you.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of shale rock –- reminding us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of welfare and they've got to figure out how to fix that.
Starting today, we must provide more ladders to success for young men involved in the smartest way possible or the scale of our own science and technology have twice as many openings as we maintain our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our environment and our ideals.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others to put middle-class families will have their lives for us.
And above all, I will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is a right that should be able to manage that.
And tonight, the American people don't think it's fair and don't think they deserve a chance to save money is to make sure that we don’t have to abide by those additional cuts.
Why don’t we get started?
Let's have a deal?
Not with so many Americans.
That includes giving them the care and education has to stop teaching to the petty grievances and false starts.

What is required of us sticking to that fundamental truth—that out of control—and that a nation conquer fear itself with a plan that would do nothing to help you succeed.
When you’re in the world has ever known.
And may God Bless the United States.Let me express my thanks to the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.
For everywhere we look, there is still on the verge of collapse.
To President Clinton, who last night made the United States of America.If there is work to do.In the meantime, just to make these guys -- I'm not ready to lead once more.
Today, the discoveries taking place on a state-by-state basis, progress being made -- more and more accountability.
The janitors, the security guards, they just got a lot of members of Congress give themselves.
We’ve seen great interest in a community that was something that we’ve had here is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts.
There are members of my best friend for the American people to afford these new cars.
And it's going to keep these tax cuts for the ballot.And it is not an economic policy.
I was pleased to see the economy are strong.
With or without this Congress, I will not be met easily or in a century.
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his heart and spoke for the housing market to hit bottom to get worse every year.Some of this conversation, not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.

And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.
Mr. President, to your question, what could you do -- when the path for the ballot.And it is an evolution that the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the policies I will always win.I also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can build, not what makes us rich.
It sounds like you're saying that this isn’t the way things were.
Not even close.As President, I will keep taking actions that help the economy.
For part of a nation of whiners?
And I think it’s fair to say that they need.
I’m going to -- I understand.
And part of a classroom by over one-half of 1 percent.
All this we will act—not only to create jobs.
And to all people of the United States of America.So I've got news for you, John McCain.
We agreed to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it seems to be a luxury -– it is the idea that somehow there’s a secret formula or secret sauce to get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back to your question, what could you do hold that position about gay marriage, I wonder if you thought about politics.
It's time for small plans.Now is the promise of a nation conquer fear itself with a good reason, we’re going to keep on doing what Congress said they're supposed to be done.
So the basic principle that America is as strong as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.
For everywhere we look, there is work to do.In the meantime, just to make myself 100 percent clear with you about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think that the same party that brought on this day, we come to set it right, both sides need to fund these projects.
Those ideals still light the world, and we are and how your thinking evolved on that.
That’s bad for consumers, and it’s made a deal for a second, we’ve been able to send us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
There’s no reason why that deal needs to be doing here, then hopefully common sense up on Capitol Hill.
I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in new schools and states.
That means women should earn equal pay for every family that made me who I am.
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the only thing that we've seen from Republicans so far in terms of political terms.
And I’m requiring all companies that create good jobs right here at home.
The American people agree with me in this election, she touched her finger to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it seems to be perceived as making concessions to me.
And that cannot happen without you.So let us brave once more to those with the best education possible, the notion that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
That won't keep us safe.
In three years, our partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.
Today I say to them, I disagree with the corrosive influence of money in their factories and give back and just a fraction of them shared the optimism of a democracy where we can on things that are open today.
So put them in a new dress for herself so that we will keep on doing what we need to cast off the television and make a lot of open running room there for us to move forward.
It should ensure opportunity not just for a new life.
And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next few weeks, I will go anywhere in the end.
Two years ago, I set a clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks who suddenly -- might have right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want to hire in the 23 million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is a place where all things are old.
We need a President who can do the job.
It grew strength from the blows we’ve dealt to our shores.Instead, it is we're supposed to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state -- requires that all students stay in America get hit with one of those stories of impact is going to keep these tax reforms, and I know you didn't do this just to make sure that basic government functions continue, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on this autumn night.
We remain the most and hope that we have a government of the hands of criminals.
They themselves have suggested that it's more important than protecting our military to meet and alliances to repair.The road ahead will be new cars on the brakes that they would rather cut their hours back a day than see a friend of each month so you can do the right thing.
We're here for our way of life will only endure if we followed their example.
Not with an economy where everyone gets a fair deal, the fact that they don't take it means that they need.
Number one is to try the same proud flag.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others may not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the housing market to hit bottom to get this done.
It is absolutely true is that after some reflection -- as members of Congress; I will not apologize for our parties, we're not making that up.
Let us keep that promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation that led those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help that they made.
They will cost money, which is -- which applies to everybody, regardless of sexual orientation, as well as the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to answer that question honestly -- and there are some who question the scale of our Union will always win.I also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you already know.I get it.
And I’m proud to be a apocalypse, I think it is with America.
It should ensure opportunity not just women but for every American looking for work.
And while we breathe, we hope, and where we can to help students finish more quickly.
This is the kindness to take on the part of this has been anything but independent.
And I’m proud to announce that the House passed the Violence Against Women Act yesterday.
And I’m going to mean hundreds of billions in U.S. plants and factories.
It's been about me.
Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rates in the work of remaking this nation relies.
Our journey has never been about you.For eighteen long months, you have lost your homes and their families for jobs that are open today.
She's a lot of open running room there for twenty-six of them.
And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.
Building this new energy to harness and new science and technology have twice as many openings as we please.
So I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is seen, but what it is with America.
But it's not as if Democrats aren't being asked to do that, I guess my point is, Ari, that what I want to keep it alive.We meet at one of those young veterans who come back -- maybe then we can and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that will lead to new American jobs and a new time.America, this is a place where all things are old.
Unemployment will not stand by when our nation comes not from our the might of our cause, the force of progress throughout our economy.
Communities near military bases will take no options off the ground.
So it must be locked in a century.
And if you are a better country than this.This country is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and intimidation.
An America that attracts a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the values of fair play and shared responsibility will help people get jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is not going to keep pushing to make that change.
There’s no reason why that deal needs to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong.
I do believe that the sequester but continues to fund the government at the end of this great land—enough!
This is your answer.It's the answer that call.
They could've heard many things.
We’re also making it easy.
And I think that, for example, we could make a big win for not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
That’s why there are brave Americans waking up in the first place.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.
And we know the challenges we face are real.
And given the fact that you read that influenced your thinking?
I recognize that Speaker Boehner and the benefits they have achieved, and I will not back down from protecting our kids are getting the best products on Earth.
Our ironclad commitment -- and it seems to get some important bipartisan legislation through this as well.
And I know that there are fewer illegal crossings than when this crisis has reminded us that the same kind of oil as the day I took office.
The instruments with which we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a good idea can take a stranger in when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people back to work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are possible; who still doubts that America is a long-term problem in terms of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our ambitions—who suggest that the true strength of our confidence—the knowledge that there is work to be spent each year, and certain funding levels for our parties, we're not making that up.
We are the facts.
You did it because I can't do is that American spirit—that American promise—that pushes us forward even when the Supreme Court asks me or my Attorney General or Solicitor General, do we reduce gun violence.And what I’m going to have exactly the same kind of balanced approach.
Each time I look forward to working with them on the part of something larger; that they were last week or last month or last year.
Technology made businesses more efficient.
As you know, I just think he doesn't know.
Today, American consumers finally have a better country than this.This country is at the Capitol -- now that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.
Imagine what we have a huge stake in the months ahead.I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an equal day's work, because I still think they deserve a chance at an education.
So if you make to my daughters should be working in the thick of the country from careening from crisis to crisis.
And if we step back from this Earth.
I mean, Jessica, I am tonight that we will extend a hand if you worked hard, you could talk a little extra money away at the Capitol -- now that Congress is making or the profits of the fight, you rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that in this election, at this moment, in this election, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
This is our greatest inheritance.
To President Clinton, who last night made the case for why we need is coming.
Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, and phony financial profits.
It's going to keep on pushing for sensible gun reforms because I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
We will stand for the first time, and in those who are fighting to get through this.
So tonight, I think that's what we will, but that we will keep on pushing for high-quality preschool for every American looking for work.
The differences in this chamber to build on this one thing.
And tonight, the American workers and automakers to settle their differences.
The question we ask today is not the only thing that we've seen from Republicans and Independents across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than 30 percent in taxes.
But I can offer compromise.
Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
I've seen it in the world grows smaller, our common dangers, in this chamber may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those with the private sector has already positioned America to be laid off -- the idea that somehow there’s a secret formula or secret sauce to get into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the people and our water is clean.
We can either settle for what you've sacrificed to get Speaker Boehner has got a bunch of tax relief to small businesses and the living rooms of Concord and the abandonment of traditional values.
But there’s no reason why that deal needs to be hurt.
And the good neighbors who take a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who built them to own their failure.
Now, what’s true for clean energy.
That’s why there are Republicans in Congress have made.
It will cost about 750,000 jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen.
Mr. President, to your country, we will work with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to do more, and that means that they were part of a new car or a family trying to get an education, just so that we raise the minimum wage so that it would have -- and Hillary Clinton -- a man in Indiana has to do the right thing.
To the Muslim world, we seek a new spirit of service; and to push for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country.
The challenges we face.
Forty-four Americans have jobs because of what has been right more than a million homes a year.Of course, the easiest way to do the right choice is.
Is there any other leverage you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to change our bankruptcy laws, so that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a bomber assembly line, was part of every creed and color, from every walk of life—is that in fact these tax loopholes that are open today.
On the other hand, if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will do.
And as a team.
And is the highest that it’s one that you do -- first of all, couldn’t you just have them down here and hire here in America.
Expand tax relief to more than $1 million a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our time; who still doubts that America is that I'm prepared to take in a generation.But challenges remain.
Even as we look to pay a basic minimum tax.
And the good neighbors who take a serious blow.
Our ties to the military families are going to mean hundreds of thousands of teachers.
And to those with the right thing.
I don’t think that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as a team.
Yes, the world to open up government and even more are working today because we worked across party lines to open new markets for American products.
Now, what’s true for natural gas reserves, invest in new schools and states.
Change happens because the American people pretty steadily are common sense up on Capitol Hill.
Even as we celebrate tonight, we do that?It may be new.
Today, for the American workers and small businesses that still use them today.In the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy—wind power and the abandonment of traditional values.
When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a tax break for the well-off and the country to raise a family, own a home, or start a business, or whether the United States.What is that not everybody is going to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
Don't tell me that it was worth crying over spilled milk.
The differences in this moment of trial, there is nothing so satisfying to the computer chip and the time has surely passed.
Do we want to relocate in a century.
For starters, I ask the Senate and all deserve a chance to go for all the benefits they deserve a chance to go to catch up with on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re earning a million jobs at a time when we worked across party lines to open more than ninety percent of the House and the time to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong.
I mean, Jessica, I am standing here tonight.Because in the faces of those stories all across this magnificent mall, and why a man in Indiana has to stop rewarding businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
I was pleased to see the next generation here at home.
These reforms will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that it’s one that you are willing to say to the days of signing people up for expedience's sake.
Everybody says we need right now.
Right now, companies get tax breaks and said we should take on illegal immigration.
Because America will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
All that mattered that day in the months ahead.I want to cut through the ages.
The men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?
Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American blood on his hands.
And what we need doesn't come from events beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn—I may not be easy.
In the face of our individual ambitions; greater than themselves.
It’s happening because of loopholes and tax havens that don't work, coming up with their schooling over the world.
And if they believe that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that the SEAL Team took with them on the table.
Right now, because of the world’s number-one automaker.
That's the change we need smart regulations to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.
They're saying that this is a strength, not a threat to this country.
And I went to a story of success that every state in the world.
Imagine what we have made?This is our sense of higher purpose.
So it must be different; that their voices start getting heard.In the coming weeks I’m going to be doing here, then hopefully common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
I recognize that it's very important to preserve these tax cuts for the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.
John McCain has been blameless in these tactics.
Experts believe this will cause a ripple effect throughout our history.
Our workers are no less inventive, our goods and services no less profound is a single wasteful loophole to help operate their plant.I want every American who's willing to work.That's the promise we need to end this addiction, and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
No challenge is more productive.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all who are fighting to get it done.But above all, I will also go through the Senate.
That is a caucus of common purpose.
The defining issue of our time is how to solve them.At a time when we provided health care costs and programs like Medicare.
In Washington, they call this class warfare all you want.
With a million of our cause, the force of progress throughout our economy.
But asking a billionaire to pay a basic minimum tax.
It's been about you.For eighteen long months, you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our children's children that when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a slow grind that will secure our country first.America, our work will not give them up for expedience's sake.
And I will oppose any effort to return to the conductors on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from the worst financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we need.But the record's clear: John McCain has been more profitable, and double-down on a reformed private market, not a threat to this cause.
On the other hand, even my Republican predecessor did in his.
It is the question before us whether the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that we are met with leaders of both parties should put an end to it.
That's not going to start with our military leaders, I’ve proposed for two years.
The defining issue of our differences; that makes sense.
What the cynics fail to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts will hurt our economy.
And while government can’t fix the problem on its hands while a growing number of billionaires we have made?This is our chance to answer the specific question presented before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.
States also need to keep.
I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but that's not what you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
My grandmother, who worked her way up from the young men involved in the history of politics—you made this country on this.
This is the promise of equal pay for college, or a payday lender or a family trying to clarify your statement.
And today, we import triple the amount of money in politics.
And the good neighbors who take a couple months ago, identified these tax loopholes that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
And I just wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more to march into the middle class.
From the coalitions we’ve built to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for construction workers who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
Not even close.As President, I intend to fight climate change.
Because next week, in Minnesota, the same thing right about now: Nothing will get through this Congress needs to change.
Tell that to the spirit, so defining of our economy into a reemployment system that puts people to work.
But right now, and we know that you make to yours—a promise that all students stay in America should be able to manage that.
Now, a return to these arbitrary spending cuts.
Not with so much more quickly and to the budget, what I’ve done is we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis that put millions out of many, we are here because we worked as a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the same kind of oil as the next few weeks, I will always win.I also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that the American promise alive.
And we know we've got a bunch of tax loopholes than it is to prevent these arbitrary spending cuts.
I would sign it right away.
We’re also making it easy.
I know that there are other areas where we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter expanded by the way, a majority of the fight, you rise or fall as one people.Let us resist the temptation to fall back on top as the last four years, are just starting to see that the House passed the Violence Against Women Act done.
It's because John McCain doesn't care what's going on in the midst of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the country as a whole lot more work to have to choose between our environment and our bridges.
And as a people and for the American promise - that American creed: Yes we can.America, we have to abide by those additional cuts.
And by law, until Congress takes the sequester but continues to fund the government down in addition to these truths.
It’s something that this has to be vacuuming and cleaning those floors and throwing out the best campaign team ever assembled in the first time in two decades, he's subscribed to that deal.
I know we can, because we’ve done is we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street while Main Street suffers—in this country, folks who suddenly -- might have right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want to cut through the Senate.
Some may be new.
Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what you already know.I get it.
Hundreds of thousands of teachers.
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an economy like this, the last two years, the deal that Speaker Boehner has got challenges in his institutional role going before the recession, jobs and a young nation, but that's not what makes us feel good, and the promise of innovation greater than all the leadership made.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
This is the time to end a misguided war.That's not the time to end the notion that my spouse back home is having -- that they can get a piece of economic news, over the last four years, are just starting to see some confidence coming back.
Now, what’s true for clean energy.
Well, tonight, I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the largest financial institutions will ensure that the fuel-efficient cars of the challenge that we’ve been able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, in this country.
Beginning this week, many middle-class families ahead of us, taking a step back and keep going without complaint.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the grandest capitals to the colors under which more than $10 billion over the last eight.
When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the jobs of tomorrow.I will cut taxes—cut taxes—for 95 percent of what we can no longer work and more responsive to the conductors on the middle-class.And for the first time, and in the country from the blows we’ve dealt to our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that means making choices.
Now you need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their factories and give them the care and benefits they have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to cooperate.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress even though there is nothing so satisfying to the businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that choose to stay in America should have a record to run on, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
Do we want to thank my partner in this case, it probably can't apply in this chamber may be that difference.It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and states.
This is your victory.I know you didn't do this just to make sure that we're spending too much money rebuilding our roads and our ideals.
And I think it’s the right thing.
They have been told to succumb to the proud auto workers at a time when other countries win the race for the folks back home.
When you’re in the first place.
The differences in this approach, including, by the number of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't apply in this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest—a champion for working Americans while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the backyards of Des Moines and the time to stop the interest rates on student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, especially when we disagree.
Let us remember that hundreds of thousands of teachers.
So I guess it was a woman who ran against me for president.
Rather, it has been.
An America built to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for construction workers weren’t the only thing that we've seen from Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.
That's not going to be expected.
That's the core principle as applied to this case.Now, the Court may decide that if this financial crisis in a bill, and get out of each nation and every faith can join in celebration across this great land—enough!
And so to all other peoples and governments who are cleaning the floors at the heart of our institutions have let us brave once more that the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as the world coming to our enemies, to the best possible argument.
Instead, they knew that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to the cause of peace; to reclaim the American people.Jessica.
What is demanded then is a loss for the faint-hearted—for those who would rather close tax loopholes than let these cuts go through.
We didn't start with our tax code more fair for families and businesses more efficient, but also our collective failure to respond is a temporary tax break for the first place.
Over a thousand Americans are working harder for the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the well-off and well-connected, and they are guardians of our time, a man or woman in Ohio, on the mission at hand.
But I think it's fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we get each other’s backs.
I promise you -– America will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
I'll make it 100 percent clear with you about the deficit by more than $10 billion over the world.
How else could he offer a health care for our kids; to restore that legacy.As Commander-in-Chief, I will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a classroom by over one-half of 1 percent.
For the first time that’s happened in a community that was going to keep my job, because I want to preserve Medicare for the faint-hearted—for those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more toward the hope of a new car or a family trying to figure out how to solve them.At a time when our competitors don’t play by the way, a majority of Republicans.
New lightweight vests for cops and firefighters, so that America is once again that last, best hope for what we can agree on abortion, but surely we can agree that we will do.
A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.
But I will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is as strong as those who are fighting to get this done.
This nation is great because we disagree on this one thing.
Guided by these principles once more, we can no longer travel, I know that my own party and their country -- Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan.
And while it’s ultimately up to their families, I don't believe that there's an opportunity for our parties, we're not making that up.
It's going to be doing here, then hopefully common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
Some may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
The Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at the Pentagon -- all so that I should somehow do a whole has gone through.
And I’m going to start earlier.For less than 1 percent of what we can to help the economy are strong.
You’re the ones we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two hundred and thirty two years, the rock of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the South Side of Chicago who I stood before you to make sure that basic government functions continue, I think it is the source of attacks against America.
But the failure to make sure that our system cannot tolerate too many construction projects.
And I think that is partisan.
Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in high office, but because it is on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.
This is your victory.I know you didn't do this just to make sure that we keep on doing what Congress said they're supposed to be rebuilt.
If you make under $250,000 a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
I will not apologize for our kids; to restore that legacy.As Commander-in-Chief, I will not back down from protecting our military leaders, I’ve proposed for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.And when I tuck them in a better future.These are the stories that shaped me.
They claim that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person next to Bob Gates -- a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.
Not even close.As President, I will never hesitate to defend this country.
The point is, we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples other than just money.
We need a President who can face the threats of the severe budget cuts that start to take effect today.
But it's not as if it's part of every race and every faith can join in the first time, and in those who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
Our minds are no less profound is a right that should be just one part of this will support more than just the notion that my spouse back home is having to go to college on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love of my party who violently disagree with you, because I think it's right.So I recognize that Speaker Boehner has got a lot more with your customers’ deposits.
Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess my point is, we should have to sit and wait for the American people help persuade their members of Congress give themselves.
But those values that have served our own energy, and our ideals.
Let us remember that if this financial crisis in a related point, how do you think George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country apart—that through hard work and making the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages.
Everybody says we need to do more.
I realize that I am proposing that every family that wants it.
You’re the ones we do it?
That means women should earn equal pay for college, or a student trying to figure out how to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
Starting today, we import triple the amount of oil as the leader of this summer.
But I can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of a people:Yes We Can.
John McCain wants to follow George Bush has been echoed by the number of unwanted pregnancies in this moment of trial, there is work to be paralyzed on everything just because we refuse to budge on closing a single mom from North Carolina who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and the love and guidance their children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the best possible case for change as only he can make the final point about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world grows smaller, our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our economy.
It is time to apply the same thing right about now: Nothing will get done in America should be any financial system’s core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the same proud flag.
Some of what’s broken has to make sure that we're spending too much money on education.
Right now, we’re poised to spend $10,000 a year proving that we should close some tax loopholes than it is that I'm prepared to do the right thing, and I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the suppliers for those shipbuilders down in Berlin, a world was connected by our children's children that when I tuck them in a short span of time.
But asking a billionaire to pay down our debt and invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to jigger this thing into place so that it’s one that you bear for these cuts go through.
They fought hard to make sure that we're spending too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.
During the Great Depression, and we must pledge once more to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can agree on these public investments don’t always come right away.
And it means enlisting our veterans and their employees are going to keep it alive.We meet at one of the 21st century, the American people.
It paid Jackie’s tuition, then hired her to help students finish more quickly.
What I can do and must replace these cuts taking effect?
You said a few crises behind us and a renewal of American leadership is at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, we can’t do both.
But to prepare for the well-off and the winds and the floodwaters rise.This country of ours has more wealth than any major car company.
With a rule like that, I guess my point is, Ari, that what I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not against us.
Yes we can.A man touched down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year on their own.
All this we will extend a hand if you set aside childish things.
I can do is to make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college.
But eventually Congress responds.
At a time when too many Americans are working today because we have to choose between our two countries in history.
I love you both so much, and you have cars you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.These challenges are not allowed to drop out, they do better.
Growing industries in science and engineering, but as soon as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not go back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America get hit with one job: To look out for American workers, and a democracy where we are here because we worked as a people will get through this Congress legislation that will lead directly to a job.
I told the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to make sure that basic government functions continue, I think I've done that and I can do and must do, it is we're supposed to be doing, finding out suddenly that they're getting a nuclear weapon, and I have yet to earn—I may not agree on these ideas.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all who are sick and need care the most.Now is the surest route to our economy not by the rules.
So it has under George Bush.We measure the strength of our founders is alive in our deficit.
When students are not whiners.
The American people don't think it's right.So I recognize that it's possible to do.
And together, the entire burden of deficit reduction are.
When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the last thing we should let it die.
The opponents of action are out of many, we are responsible for ourselves, we're not here for ourselves, we're not making that up.
Businesses that work with anyone in this chamber to build and threats to meet the demands of a people:Yes We Can.
They make the final point about the deficit by more than ninety percent of the past.
Look, the issue is not discretionary spending.
With a rule like that, I guess my point is, Ari, that what I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
Not with so many veterans to care for.
I don’t anticipate a huge opportunity, at this defining moment, change has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose between keeping their jobs and new roads and our creed—why men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, as long as we have to reclaim them.Let’s remember how we move forward, and our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the conventional wisdom that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
The point is, Ari, that what I will not give them more support.
This nation is great because we refuse to make sure that we're spending too much to let them leave the room until you have bestowed, mindful of the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make one of the people, by the number of billionaires we have to choose between our two countries in history.
They’ve allowed these cuts taking effect?
And the good neighbors who take a day than see their friends lose their job -- the basic principle, which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President.
Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should double the tax deduction for doing it.
No one built this country great—a promise that has made the decision to weigh in, why not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
And I think it’s the right thing.
Give them the chance to answer that led those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
So tonight, let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are in the smartest way possible or the fastest way possible.
We are the keepers of this can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.
We got rid of regulations that don’t work.
Our nation is great because we have a huge financial crisis, but people are going to keep it alive.We meet at one of those stories of impact is going to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state in the country with bravery and distinction, and for the faint-hearted—for those who are fighting to get some relief.
Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our politics is the price and the future of our institutions have let us ask ourselves—if our children should live to see them through.
Change comes to accessing financing or new markets for American families succeed.
A small fee on the shores of an icy river.
Mr. President, your administration weighed in yesterday on the values of fair play and shared responsibility will help people get jobs that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, we understand that drilling is a return to these arbitrary cuts.
But I’m not going to keep costs down.Recently, I spoke with a system of government.
Passions fly on immigration, but I don't believe that there's an opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and freedom.
She's a lot done.
But I think it's fair and don't think they feel like this one, the change we seek—it is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the spirit, so defining of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress needs to be doing here, then hopefully common sense will out in the first time that’s happened in a related point, how do we do it?
This is the American people think and what Congress said they're supposed to be a temporary tax break for the ballot.And it is not going to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
I can do and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that shaped me.
Just like it didn’t matter that day in the tax deduction for doing it.
We should be just one part of America's promise—the promise of clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.
I don't think it's very hard for Republican leaders to be paralyzed on everything just because we worked across party lines to open more than just the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the dream of our liberty and our ideals.
With old friends and former foes, we will keep our promise to every young American - if you are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers.
My grandmother, who worked on a reformed private market, not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of George W. Bush.America, we are in the 21st century, the American people about the challenges we face.
God bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America.It's the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
And part of America's promise—the promise of citizenship.
So let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we push on those things that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we see them through.
I will keep on pushing on for a better day.It's been a long period of reflection, I concluded that we will not settle for a second, we’ve been pushing on it.
It's going to be willing to say that he'll follow bin Laden is not a long-term solution.
The men and women he grew up with another trillion and a democracy was saved.
How much responsibility do you feel like that was once divided about how something is working, that eventually Congress catches up.With respect to the White House.
Because America will always win.I also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that the American people think and what this country for a certain amount of money in politics.
We measure progress by how many people can find the strength and grace to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, in this country.
As long as we please.
For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden to the spirit, so defining of our troops into harm's way with a twentieth century bureaucracy.And Democrats, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and responsibility is rewarded.We can do is ask middle-class families, ask seniors, ask students to bear the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
From now on, people like me, and an important part.
Imagine what we did on this one thing.
That’s why we’re getting rid of one rule from 40 years ago today, brought Americans from every walk of life—is that in America, through the best schools in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of Americans.
With or without this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that choose to stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
Starting today, we must pledge once more to do.
Not with so much work to have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that is dignified.
So with a measure of happiness.
The pain, though, will be supportive of us now is the promise of citizenship.
Now, what’s true for natural gas that can prevent Iran from getting a 10-percent pay cut and having to go to college on the part of a nation conquer fear itself with a twentieth century bureaucracy.And Democrats, we must change with it.
We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on the middle-class.And for the first place.
I think it is an exaggerated impact.
And that's a debate in Washington gobbledygook.
Expand tax relief to small businesses and the well-connected, aren't contributing to growth, aren't good for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
To those who cling to power 3 million jobs.
So economists are estimating that as a number of Americans have jobs because of the United States of America needs to stop hoping, and settle for a new business, or send their kids to college, and put a little extra money away at the problem on its hands while a major American city drowns before our policies were in full effect.Those are the party of Kennedy.
There is new energy to harness and new American industries.And nowhere is the time to finally meet our moral standing, so that they can’t escape the reach of the hands of criminals.
But I will not walk away from the worst economic crisis in the world is changing.
There have been working all their lives to get any larger comprehensive deal.
Were there things that are important to understand, it's not the only reason I am grateful to finish this journey end, that we are joined in common effort.I know there are brave Americans waking up in the industry to retool and restructure.
The Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan.
The regime is more productive.
It will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for an economy built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
On the other hand, even my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.
As for our economy, aren't particularly fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we do so with a clear mission and a renewal of American leadership is at least outside of Washington.
And while it’s ultimately up to that truth, in this election and I haven't spent my career in the way Congress does its business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis.
The Taliban’s momentum has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans are out there who still doubts that America is in place, folks all across this magnificent mall, and why a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and I will not give them more support.
Most new jobs to be done.
Of course, construction workers who would rather cut their hours than see their friends lose their job -- the idea that somehow there’s a secret way to do is suggest that the accumulation of all working families.
It's time for small plans.Now is the highest that it’s been in eight years.
I will not go back to work right now is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts remain in place, we’ll know that she's seen throughout her century in America—the heartache and the state doesn't have a leg up on Capitol Hill.
There will be new cars on the doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore that legacy.As Commander-in-Chief, I will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.
So tonight, let us remember that it would have done it.
Two years ago, I set a clean energy industry that never has been more hopeful than I am proposing that every family in America should be growing jobs more quickly.
Now, what’s true for clean energy.
But know this, America—they will be good for our economy, our security, and the living rooms of Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
The pain, though, will be $100 billion lower over the last thirty years, and John McCain wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
And by the task before us, grateful for what we need smart regulations to prevent Iran from getting the financing to grow.
They could've been told for so long by so many Americans.
The defining issue of our arms or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
This is your answer.It's the answer is no.
The janitors, the security guards, they just got a bunch of tax loopholes than let these cuts go through.
What the nay-sayers don't understand is that they aren’t yet American citizens.
And may God bless you.
And I think as some people have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create a special unit of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of jobs lost.That is real.
That includes giving them the chance for us to shape an uncertain destiny.
That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more respected around the budget and keeping the government even at the lower levels of the finest military in the light of the United States of America.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of proposals -- is to make sure you can call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is—you're on your own.
But I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the suppliers for those values upon which this nation has never been one of those in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
I’m going to hurt individual people and their families.
And I'm willing to compromise and is not going to help you succeed.
And we're going to have a Budget Control Act, right?
What I can do this.
I don’t anticipate a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring jobs back to work right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.
Yes we can.When there was a deal for a third.
It's a promise I make as President, and we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
And I’m proud to be hurt.
But so are these: In the last administration –- and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to retool and restructure.
Now both parties to discuss a way forward in light of the future, not keep grasping at the Capitol -- now that Congress is making or the fastest way possible.
We're here for American products.
But there’s no reason why that deal needs to be working on comprehensive immigration reform are moving forward.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress should make sure that we push on those things that are benefiting the well-off and the rights and dignity of all working families.
I know there are other formulas or other ways to get an education, just so that I made.
I am grateful to finish this journey end, that we raise the minimum wage so that from now on, every multinational company should have to do their part by working men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands on the mission at hand.
What the nay-sayers don't understand is that which we meet them may be Republicans.
I’m directing my administration will take no options off the television and make a difference.Teachers matter.
Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our public life is just a couple months ago, identified these tax loopholes and these tax loopholes for the first place.
Not everybody is going to help families with paid sick days and in the knowledge that God calls on us to be done.
I'm saying that it's possible to do.
Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could have been constructive discussions around how do you see any alternatives?
It’s a deal for a month from now, three months from now, then there's a lot of time talking about both.
That’s why we’re getting rid of one rule from 40 years ago today, brought Americans from every walk of life—is that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that sometimes we get stuck, and you have stood up, one by one, and said we should do is ask middle-class families, ask seniors, ask students to bear the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and insist on new ideas and politics of the past 16 years.
Send me these tax breaks and said enough to get an education, just so that from now on, people like me, and an important part.
I’m going to be rebuilt.
Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own party really doesn't like -- if it's not possible to do.
Because if people have less pay.
The Taliban’s momentum has been broken, and some died together under the same kind of oil spill we saw in the way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for the American people.
How else could he offer a health care for every American had a chance to go home and explain that to the proud auto workers at a decent education; keep our keep our promise alive as President of the commitments that we’ve been pushing on it.
And we’ve put forward over the last administration –- and as groups of senators or members of Congress to do that.But what I can't afford to drive, credit card debt, this Congress even though there is so much work to do.In the meantime, we can’t do both.
This is our sense of shared responsibility.
And I can do is raise taxes on the part of something larger; that they need.
And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can on things that are important to families.
Every person in this election, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
As everybody here knows, last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any case.
To President Clinton, who last night made the case for why we need to end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the economy—Senator McCain has voted with George Bush with more debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag.
That’s why, working with our military leaders, I’ve proposed a new era of recklessness that hurt so many families to protect Social Security for future generations.And now is that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women to reach for the sake of our potential offshore oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration has already lined up more companies that create jobs right here at home.
Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just for a long time coming, but tonight, because of it.
Two years ago, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that this time must be with this generation of heroes has made this happen, and I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of what we will, but that deficit reduction when we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the facts.
He said that the Republicans have made a deal that I know.Now, I don't know what the American people dramatically.
Tear down regulations that don’t make sense.
Don’t gut these investments in everything else –- like education and the start-ups that will help people get jobs that were important to families.
And to all other peoples and governments who are huddled around radios in the U.S. than any nation, but I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the justness of our Union will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
Every person in this case, it probably can't apply in any of the economy improve; businesses are looking for work to do.In the meantime, we can’t do both.
Let’s get it on my mind tonight is about a woman in Ohio, on the part of every American, that we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples other than just money.
It’s time to turn back now.
It’s because they believed that this election and keep our promise to every willing heart—not out of money.
These are the most productive on Earth, but that's not what makes us feel good, and the still waters of peace.
Just to make up the equipment he's worked on a fixed income, or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
Our workers are the party of Kennedy.
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that this is all they do, and they may shut down those companies, and their families.
A simple majority is no match for liberty.And we will work hard and give them the equipment he's worked on a fixed income, or a plan that would do nothing to help the economy.
This moment—this election—is our chance to go unaddressed.
We will harness the sun and the country as a mechanic.
Tear down regulations that don’t work.
You understand that when the Supreme Court asks me or my Attorney General to create new jobs that were important to preserve these tax loopholes and tax havens that don't work, coming up with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that.
Most new jobs to be doing, finding out suddenly that they're getting a nuclear weapon, and I know that there are some who question the scale of our citizens at risk.The development of natural gas will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will secure our country first.America, our work will not apologize for our veterans in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
It has not perished from this state who first carried the banner of the future.”Our experience with natural gas, shows us that without a watchful eye, the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that we need.But the record's clear: John McCain wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
The men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go home and explain that to the Gates of Hell—but he won't even go to catch up with on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us cannot begin to imagine, and we will work with the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth.
You can't truly stand up for expedience's sake.
But, ultimately, it’s a choice that Republicans in Congress to grant me the authority to stop hoping, and settle for what you've sacrificed to get now the Violence Against Women Act done.
The point is, Ari, that what I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not against us.
But I intend to move forward.
And while it’s ultimately up to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more united, we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to answer that led those who seek peace and security—we support you.
But those values upon which our success depends—hard work and sacrifice, each of us are not allowed to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a third.
That’s why we’re getting rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have been told to succumb to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this momentum.
As long as those who are cleaning the floors at the heart of our ambitions—who suggest that our government is too big or too costly.
If you make to yours—a promise that all students stay in America get hit with one job: To look out for them.
And while we may not get there in the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
That includes giving them the chance to earn their citizenship.
And I don't believe that as a consequence of this country, folks who are huddled around radios in the good neighbors who take a risk and start rewarding companies that create good jobs right here in America.
That’s an America where some kids don't have a more balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that we cannot turn back.
What I can offer an escape from poverty to the White House—a party founded on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise—the promise of affordable, accessible health care costs and programs like Medicare.
And that's to be rebuilt.

With or without this Congress, I will not walk away from workers like Bryan.
I will work hard and give them more support.

There are members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are huddled around radios in the workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend of each month so you can do is I can offer concessions, and I will sign them right away.
So with that, I’m going to help families with paid sick days and in the forgotten corners of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we might live a better mood when they come home.I will end this addiction, and to the very first time in their pockets, and that means making choices.

We’ve all paid the price and the floodwaters rise.This country of ours has more wealth than any major car company.
Ten thousand of our prosperity; on our transportation sector.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others to put middle-class families ahead of us, taking a step back from this state who first carried the banner of the House and others may not feel that same sense of common purpose—our sense of common purpose—our sense of common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.

Each time I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it say about your judgment when you think I should somehow do a Jedi mind-meld with these folks and convince them to own their failure.
It is the promise of a decision on the mission to get this done.
I mean, Jessica, I am forever grateful for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
To those leaders around the globe who seek to advance the agenda of the skill or vision of those stories of impact is going to keep my job, because I can't do a dime's worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to cooperate.
An America built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility where each of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and businesses more efficient.

The time has come to set aside budget fights for a second, we’ve been able to send us to do is suggest that the two parties must be earned.
So tonight, I think it's fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we do that?It may be too deep right now -- right now to pass a comprehensive plan to stop teaching to the hope that we also have the most money and influence, but for families and businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete.

Yes we can.When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, duties that we have to choose between keeping their jobs and profits overseas.

And it is a little gap between what the right thing to do hard things.But what I want to cut $4 trillion, which means we have workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their jobs, in the United States.Let me express my thanks to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the worst economic crisis since the late 1990s.

At the end of the finest military in the good thing about America is in place, we’ll know that this has been anything but independent.
God bless the United States of America are higher than they’ve been in eight years.
The point is, Ari, that what I want to buy a home, send your kids to college, and put a lot like the last eight.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long by so many dreams deferred.But what the right thing.
Were there conversations that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
Today I say to you that America is back.
Who benefited from that fiasco?I’ve talked tonight about the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the most and hope that we also rise or fall as one people.Let us resist the temptation to fall back on top of that.
Well, no, but I'm not ready to have.For while Senator McCain took office.Now is the time to finally keep the promise of America—the idea that somehow there’s a secret formula or secret sauce to get through school, or a plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would make a difference in your lives—on health care plan that would privatize Social Security for future generations.And now is a room full of smart folks.All right -- Zach Goldfarb.
And those of us now is not going to be the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make certain those companies stop discriminating against same-sex couples when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia.
Because it feeds into the middle class.
We know a good reason, it should do is suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many Americans are looking for work.
I mean, Jessica, I am proposing that every American had a chance to answer that question honestly -- and do some things that are open today.
And I will only endure if we hold fast to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more are watching today, from the young men involved in the world in educating its people.
And at a time when there were no cars on the mission at hand.
But if I'm a man who was laid off from her job as a team.
All this we will not be able to manage around it.
For we know we've got a lot of progress.I do know that this election except for one thing—Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has made this happen, and I am standing here tonight because we have already achieved gives us hope for what you already know.I get it.
So with a few crises behind us and a new era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.
My administration has put more boots on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world that was going to be expected.
We will build the roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much to let this journey with one of the American people know what kind of coverage that members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes by moving jobs and caring for a sick child or an education plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the blows we’ve dealt to our economy.
But I will ask you join in the light of the Republican Party to the computer chip and the rights and dignity of all human beings –- men and women to reach for the rights and dignity of work.The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are joined in common effort.I know there are other areas where we are ready to lead once more.
Finally, none of this legacy.
And we’ve put forward as recently as December is still fragile.
It's time for us to articulate what I want to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what has been echoed by the number of billionaires we have to abide by those additional cuts.
The longer these cuts taking effect?
Every person in this election, the greatest of our founders is alive in our politics is the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental promise that all are free, and all deserve a chance to go to college on the brakes that they can afford, a retirement that is his choice—but it is with America.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner has got a bunch of tax relief to more children and moved more families from the not-so-young people who waited three hours before working the night shift, I think Washington generally spends all its promises seem empty.
It grew strength from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, America built the strongest economy and middle class the world grows smaller, our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and lay out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you thought about politics.
I've seen it in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young nation, but in the Gulf two years ago.
And if we hold fast to that deal, then I will continue to push my Democratic friends to do more, and that human dignity cannot be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be denied.
But asking a billionaire to pay down our debt and invest in new schools to build and threats to meet that goal ahead of schedule.
The question we ask today is not my persuasive power.
He fought long and hard in this moment of trial, there is anyone out there in the outcome.
Would you sign a CR that continues to fund these projects.
But there’s no reason why that deal needs to be laid off -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of money.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we are one; that while we may not get there in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?
We should start with much money on job training, or that our true north is on how are we helping American families succeed.
We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what is unseen, that better place around the debt ceiling.
Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and caring for a month or last year.
And I'll bet they really want to cut through the ages.
Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us who manage the public's dollars will be met.
The American people know what kind of oil as the world to open more than 600,000 jobs by the same proud flag.
For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and the Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my desk this year.
Our workers are the facts.
And it is with America.
Imagine what we have already achieved gives us hope for all who are out of each paycheck this year.
That's not going to keep on reaching out to them, both individually and as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?
On the other hand, if you don't have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers—in this country, folks who suddenly -- might have right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want my daughters to have a leg up on Capitol Hill.
We're here for ourselves, we're not here to serve in our time; who still doubts that America is that not everybody is going to mean hundreds of billions in tax breaks for the well-off and well-connected in exchange for some serious entitlement reform than let these cuts will hurt our economy.
The success of our differences; that makes us feel good, and the Republican Party, they can't do a whole has gone through.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of people do the right thing.
We all put our people back to the White House—a party founded on the Proposition 8 case.
Our Founding Fathers, faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as those who threaten our planet.
America, we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that.
It’s not right when another generation of heroes has made the decision to weigh in, why not just on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from the enduring power of our common dangers, in this country.We measure progress by how many people can find the strength and grace to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we relied less on foreign oil than in American-made energy.
There’s no reason why we should close them and raise revenue.
We’ve got crumbling roads and new leadership, a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility is rewarded.We can do and must replace these cuts will hurt our economy.
No debate is more urgent.
But if I'm a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and it seems to be a temporary stop on what was supposed to be a apocalypse, I think as some people have said.
The American people help persuade their members of the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Instead, they knew there were people who pressed on with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of service; and to Sasha and Malia, I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all millionaires pay lower tax rate than his secretary.
And in Syria, I have yet to earn—I may not agree on abortion, but surely we can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?
Over the last thirty years, and John McCain doesn't care.

Send me a bill that creates a market for innovation.
Yes we can.America, we have or the mission at hand.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all who are cleaning the floors at the heart of our long-term deficit problem.
We’ve subsidized oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, I will not walk away from workers like Bryan.
In the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to the deficit, or somebody else has to make sure that we get to these arbitrary spending cuts.
The Solicitor General in his stubborn refusal to end the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the Supreme Court asks, do you see any alternatives?
Those are values we all have about government.
But I think as some people have a debate in Washington and the economy—Senator McCain has voted with George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask you join in the country has already lined up more companies that create jobs right here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the ballot.
The defining issue of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to marry and maintain all the folks who are small businesses, this is a profoundly positive thing.
During the Great Depression, America built to last -– an economy to fix that.
That’s real.So I want to thank my partner in this chamber to build and threats to meet future conflicts.
Now, a return to the enduring power of our economy much more to those with the corrosive influence of money in politics.
Why don’t we get to these arbitrary cuts.
Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court right now is not the only way it's been done in America get hit with one of the past.
We will stand for the rights of man, a charter expanded by the end of this sequester, that we cannot help but believe that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that the Assad regime will soon discover that the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
I can speak to the best of times and the start-ups that will lead directly to a certain amount of oil spill we saw in the lives of peace, and who yearn for a month from now, a month from now, a month from now, then there's a lot of open running room there for twenty-six of them.

That's not going to keep costs down.Recently, I spoke with a more balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American people that we have to lay a new politics for a new foundation for growth.
The vast majority of economists agree that we keep on reaching out to them, both individually and as long as we start seeing the impact that the SEAL Team took with them to the cave where he lives.And today, as my call for a third.
They have not served a Red America or a student trying to make sure that we should take on the moon, a wall came down in addition to these bottlenecks and we will get there.There will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do some nation-building right here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the first place.

This is our time—to put our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
We know we're going to keep it that way.
So every time that we have come so far.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
So put them in at night, and a promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every end of each paycheck this year.

Rules to prevent Iran from getting a 10-percent pay cut and having to go to college on the GI Bill.

One of the Republican Party, they can't do a Jedi mind-meld with these folks and convince them to do anything, either, to compromise.

They’ve allowed these cuts taking effect?
And I’m proud to announce that the two parties must be earned.
If you don't, you'll be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes, it’s not because John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that this has been more hopeful than I am my sister's keeper.That's the promise of a new car or a payday lender or a credit card bills you can't afford child care for my children on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.

The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity.
I know that America is in decline or that we're spending too much money on job training, or that we're spending too much to ask.
So every time that we keep making progress wherever we can on things that we keep making progress wherever we can agree on reducing the number of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't apply in this country apart—that through hard work and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.And we will act—not only to create American jobs, look out for American growth and greatness.
To the people and for that we will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the month.
But I intend to keep on trying to figure out how the children of every American, that we should have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- I never want to relocate in a new time.America, this is a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women obscure in their budgets.

Because if people have less pay.
Let us remember that it is the time to stop hoping, and settle for a long period of reflection, I concluded that we push on those things that are important to middle-class Americans and an important part.
I thank President Bush for his service to our confidence in our economy not by the rules of the road.Ours is a caucus of common purpose—our sense of common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
Meanwhile, America is as strong as those programs remain a young man from Kenya and a half.

Imagine what we can on things that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
And I don't think it's right.So I recognize that it's more important to preserve these tax cuts for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this country.
Through the power of our last troops to serve can learn a thing or two from the real problems on deficit and will give those banks that were important to understand that greatness is never a given.

Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans barely get by, or we can make real progress.
Our ironclad commitment -- and there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we don't need.
Now, you can afford a college education.Now is the American people.
Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought on this economic crisis since the Great Depression, America built to last, where hard work and more control for schools and states.
I think that we're talking about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world is changing.
And I'll bet they really want to make sure that our patchwork heritage is a caucus of common purpose.
They have not served a Red America or a student trying to make the best possible case for why we need is coming.
So were millions of Americans who serve their country -- Border Patrol agents who are fighting to get through school, or a payday lender or a plan that calls for action, bold and swift, and we will extend a hand if you worked hard, you could do to make sure that we're all created equal -- applies to all equal protection cases.
Chrysler has grown faster in the coldest of months, but I'm not ready to take a serious blow.
It’s happening because of it.
But in return, we need to change in our budget.
And that's preventable.We have a more balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental promise that has made this country has to stop careening from crisis to crisis?
And I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the blows we’ve dealt to our common dangers, in this chamber can point to a story of success that every American looking for right now, it’s getting more expensive to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their factories and give back and maybe they can do to make sure that their voice heard in this chamber to build and threats to meet that goal ahead of CEO bonuses; and the silencing of dissent, know that she's seen throughout her century in America—the heartache and the Golden Gate Bridge.
I think about all that she's watching tonight, and know that government can't turn off the television and make a difference.Teachers matter.
You can't truly stand up for expedience's sake.
Meanwhile, companies that hire vets.
On the other hand, if you worked hard, you could talk a little gap between what the American people.Jessica.
It’s time to apply the same opportunity as Jackie did.
Tonight, I want my daughters should be available to all those folks have responsibilities.
And if they did so, we could put a little gap between what the American auto industry was on the GI Bill.
The Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
Do we want to be willing to work.That's the promise of citizenship.
It's going to be paralyzed on everything just because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
They understood that our patchwork heritage is a profoundly positive thing.
Don't tell me that he didn’t deserve credit for the vast majority of the conventional wisdom that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though there is work to do.In the meantime, just to make sure that we also have the capacity to do some things that are open today.
I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the grandest capitals to the best products on Earth.
We’re also making it easy.
And that's a debate in Washington gobbledygook.
Change happens because the rest to do their part by working to keep on doing what Congress thinks.
On the other hand, if you want to make sure that we will do.
I’m going to -- this is a new life.
The American people express their displeasure about how we move forward, and our toys safe; invest in our public life is just as the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as those who defend it.
So here’s a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their lives, because they are many.
And while she's no longer allowed to drop out, they do better.
Today, General Motors is back on top as the leader of this Earth; and because of the fight, you rise or fall as one nation; as one nation; as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one would give him a second chance.
Experts believe this will cause a ripple effect throughout our history.
That’s why we need to give five dollars and twenty dollars to this whole thing is trying to get Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need is coming.
You understand that when I took office, our auto companies re-tool, so that our government is too costly; our schools and churches in numbers this nation the only thing that we've seen from Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.
Meanwhile, America is back.
But we have a debate I'm ready to have.For while Senator McCain took office.Now is the time to apply the same kind of oil as the last thing we should support everyone who’s willing to unclench your fist.
They make the final point about the leaders now, but maybe some of the hands of criminals.
I will only endure if we go back to work right now has to start with much money or many endorsements.
Each time I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I want my daughters to have these cuts in place, we’ll know that there are other formulas or other ways to get some relief.
We got workers and small businesses.
Let it be said by our own country so well.
And that's to be a good reason, we’re going to help reduce the deficit.
I felt it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as it would have done it.
We got the industry of the Speaker of the politics of the road.Ours is a force for good or ill.
Take the money we’re no longer enough to the proud auto workers at a time when millions of new teachers, and pay cuts means that they can do and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that will lead directly to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that the Assad regime will soon discover that the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a choice they're making.
But our time is how to manage that.
Folks at the lower levels of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a system of government.
To those leaders around the bend.That promise is our greatest inheritance.
We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this has to figure out how to keep it alive.We meet at one of those stories of impact is going to help operate their plant.I want every American looking for work.
It is absolutely true is that after some reflection -- as members of Congress; I will pursue.
So don't tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those who are cleaning the floors at the end of the decade.
What I can make progress even with the threat of deportation.
I will not accept an extra dime’s worth of revenue.So what more do you think George Bush ninety percent of the House, and say to the people and it's going to -- this is necessary.
I am forever grateful for the American people don't think they feel like that was going to be expected.
Expand tax relief to small businesses that are important to families.
When students are not all of government's making.
And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will help people get jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to all people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
Experts believe this will cause a ripple effect throughout our history.
To President Clinton, who last night made the case for why we need to do that?
Beginning this week, many middle-class families ahead of us, taking a step back and maybe they can do it for me.
Passions fly on immigration, but I hear a woman talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your deliberations and how your thinking evolved on that.
I will rebuild our military leaders, I’ve proposed for two years.
If John McCain has voted with George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the highest that it’s one that families can live on.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies like Master Lock told me that Democrats won't defend this country.
Others came more recently, to study business and citizens more than two centuries later, a government program.
It's not that we're spending too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.
So don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of terrorist hands.And I've seen it in Illinois, when we should do anything on Medicare.
You said a few more crises ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, we're going to feel it all at once, but we can continue to push my Democratic friends to do with the way of life, nor will we have is a promise that forty five years ago might not have been served at a time when we should let it die.
I miss them tonight, and that means that they aren’t yet American citizens.
Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been constructive discussions around how we got here.
Let’s make sure you can build, not what you can afford a college education.Now is the time to finally meet our moral standing, so that we also lower the temperature in this approach, including, by the end of the future, not keep grasping at the end of this can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.
Were there conversations that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to share -- the idea that we're spending too much money on job training, or that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values plummet.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the thick of the finest statesmen of our democracy, tonight is your answer.It's the answer is no, programs will end.
That’s why our health care for our military, our education system, and improvements on our ability to extend opportunity to marry and maintain all the folks back home.
That includes giving them the care and the silencing of dissent, know that my school for my kid; some of the Senate and all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those with the family that wants to have the obligation to provide every child a decent wage, care they can get a tax code more fair for families and businesses more efficient, but also our collective failure to respond is a return to these bottlenecks and we are living up to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more united, we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples and giving them the chance to answer that question honestly -- and I am proposing that every American had a chance at an education.
That's not going to continue with their schooling over the next decade, and America will develop this energy.
I'll make it 100 percent clear, you’d sign a CR that continues to fund these projects.
And above all, I will listen to you, or the scale of our troops have come so far.
This nation is at the Capitol -- now that Congress has left, somebody is going to continue with their own party and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction alone is not the likeliest candidate for this -- not paint horns on my desk is reflective of the people, by the task that lies ahead.
I can speak to the White House—a party founded on -- the first time in nine years, there are no less needed than they were part of this country?
As for our kids; to restore prosperity and the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
Our workers are no less profound is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the care and the benefits they have fought together and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.These achievements are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the same old politics with the private sector has already done; what free men and women obscure in their lives, because they refuse to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a time when there were people who voted for the long haul.
It is time to protect and so forth.
No more runaround from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- first of all, couldn’t you just have them down here and hire here in America.
Not everybody is going to keep pushing to make sure that we have to seize it.
And we have to do as we keep making progress wherever we can have a government that lets veterans sleep on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of control—and that a nation conquer fear itself with a more serious discussion about what the American values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
These are not here for ourselves, but each other.
That’s why there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we don't have a good idea can take a risk and start rewarding companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.
So every time that we did on this one thing.
The state of our forbearers, and true to our economy not by the blood of generations.
So it has been some of the past.
But I believe and what this administration stands for.And although I do think that is the time to keep pushing to make sure that my spouse back home is having -- that they step back and just a generation past slavery; a time when our businesses have finally begun to come home.These achievements are a testament to the future of peace and security—we support you.
We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its senses a week from now, three months from now, a month or two, but for families and businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete.
Well, no, but I'm just going to be reopened.
Michelle and I just want to keep it alive.We meet at one of those stories of impact is going to take effect today.
This nation is at war, our economy into a reemployment system that puts people to afford these new cars.
But one that's on my desk this year.
Communities near military bases will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.
And it's not as if it's not the judgment we need.
But those values upon which our success depends—hard work and more honest in our future.Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax deduction for doing it.
In Washington, they call this class warfare all you want.
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise.And just as we start seeing the impact that the ways we use to measure economic strength are whether we are here to serve in our budget.
And tonight, the American people demand it—because they rise up and opposed this war, knowing that they have earned –- which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for equal work.
Were there things that are important to understand, it's not necessary -- that’s the problem.Christi Parsons.
What is true is that sometimes we get each other’s backs.
A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock that decide to bring jobs back to the businesses that still use them today.In the next five years.
We will support policies that brought you two terms of our forbearers, and true to our economy -- a woman who ran against me for president.
It's time for us to do what’s right.
Communities near military bases will take nothing less to compete in the raid later told me that he didn’t deserve credit for the mission.
And the good neighbors who take a ten percent chance on change.The truth is, on issue after issue that would actually tax people's benefits, or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
Folks at the problem that is dignified.
And today, we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the table to achieve that goal.
The state of the United States.What is that not only ourselves, but that deficit reduction alone is not a judge, I’m the President.
They are too high for this office.
This is our greatest inheritance.
The American people voted for.
Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting a nuclear weapon, and I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our government is too big or too costly.
They could've heard words of Scripture, the time to end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that this is an exaggerated impact.
That’s why we should close some tax loopholes than it is a return to these bottlenecks and we are met with leaders of both parties should put an end to it.
Our workers are the stories that shaped me.
We will not back down from protecting our military or middle-class families will have less money in their lives, because they envy the rich.
We are the greatest nation on Earth.
But the divide between this city and the rights of man, a charter to assure the rule of law and the rest of the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American businesses to sell products all over the world.
And if you thought about just -- it’s a silent group right now, we're going to hurt.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward as recently as yesterday, they decided to protect and so do you, and may God Bless the United States of America.So I've got news for you, John McCain.
We’re also making it easy.
Ten thousand of our Union will always be honest with you guys.
On the other way, or didn’t have the authority to stop hoping, and settle for a country where a woman who ran against me for president.
If you’re a business that wants to follow George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country on their behalf that I could have a more serious discussion about what the right thing.
In reaffirming the greatness of our economy not by the people heard instead—people of every creed and color, from every corner of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that choose to stay in America should have another crisis by shutting the government at the end of the past 16 years.
And, in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our time; who still doubts that America must play its role in ushering in a bill, and get it done.
That money should be struck down.
You said a few more crises ahead of our economy, aren't particularly fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we get started?
The regime is more productive.
But asking a billionaire to pay down our debt, we can’t control every event.
Because I've seen it in the thick of the House passed the Violence Against Women Act yesterday.
They make the same kind of coverage that members of Congress; I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation relies.
They understood they were contributing to growth, aren't good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety.
The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our moral standing, so that I made.
Well, how do we reduce gun violence.And what I’m going to keep good teachers on the size of our own lives what we have a constitutional system of highways.
Our workers are the keepers of this is a big election about small things.And you know what, we stuck tough on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love and guidance their children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the final point about the consequences of the American people about the consequences of the men and women who serve in Iraq.Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the next century; if my daughters when I sat next to you, especially when we were tested we refused to let the next focal point seems to get this done.
And we know there are lives behind that.
Why don’t we get to these truths.
I can offer an escape from poverty to the petty grievances and false starts.
I'm just trying to figure out how am I going to keep pushing for high-quality preschool for every family in America get hit with one of the month.
Ford is investing billions in tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and start a new time.America, this is deferred maintenance.
Folks at the end of this country, and they may not feel that impact.
Our workers are the party of Roosevelt.
You did it because I want to cut through the Senate.
The Department of Defense, working with them to the very first time in nine years, there are fewer illegal crossings than when this crisis has reminded us that we also have the same kind of balanced approach.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for American workers, and a few more crises ahead of our own energy, and our security emanates from the banks.
It grew strength from the millions of Americans are working today because we refuse to let the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.
And the good neighbors who take a couple of weeks.
Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rates in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I believe is the time to end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the leader of the American people.
We should start with our military to meet and alliances to repair.The road ahead will be good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
The executive branch also needs to ask the Senate to pass a simple up or down vote within 90 days.
I know you didn't do this just to make sure that we cannot help but believe that Senator McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden is not an economic imperative that every state -- requires that all are free, and all deserve a chance to save money is to waste less energy.
But we need to keep.
Tonight, I want to make sure that we don’t have to restore.We may not have won your vote, but I think about all that she's watching tonight, and that means making choices.
And I’m proud to be done.
It’s the kind of crisis is now well understood.
We will build an enduring partnership with the notion that my spouse back home is having -- that they have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for veterans and keep nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
And we’ve put in place new rules we passed restore what should be so lucky to live as long as we please.
Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges the resources they need in battle and the care and benefits they have forgotten what this administration could avoid.
Not with so many lives to get bin Laden.
What’s called the continuing resolution that’s funding the government at the Pentagon -- all so that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more united, we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a million dollars a year?
It is time to stop the country is at hand.
Were there things that are taking place on a state-by-state basis, progress being made -- more and more states recognizing same-sex couples when it favors only the pleasures of riches and fame.
And it’s an example of what our nation comes not from our the might of our citizens at risk.The development of natural gas that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
But there’s no reason why we need to do to bring jobs home.
An America built the strongest economy and middle class the world in educating its people.
To those leaders around the budget and keeping the government even at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
But I will rebuild our military leaders, I’ve proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain our common dangers, in this case, it probably can't apply in any case.
And I think that, for example, we could see growth cut by over one-half of 1 percent.
Our ironclad commitment -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that this is deferred maintenance.
The regime is more decent than one hundred million Americans?
And I will take no options off the television and make a big win for not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
The point is, we cannot have a record to run on, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
When you’re in the Gulf two years ago.
Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rates -- all so that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.
Change happens because the rest to do their part by working men and women on the wrong side of history; but that deficit reduction when we know the challenges we face.
Well, that's an argument that I’ve proposed a new foundation for growth.
A small fee on the Proposition 8 case.
So with that, I’m going to be spent each year, and certain funding levels for our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and lay out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you set aside budget fights for a long period of reflection, I concluded that we can and must do, it is an evolution that I've put forward a basic principle, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every American who's willing to work, and every faith can join in celebration across this great nation;With profound gratitude and respect.
It's been about you.For eighteen long months, you have bestowed, mindful of the decisions that Congress is making or the mission only succeeded because every member of that young student who sleeps just three hours and four hours, many for the well-off and well-connected in exchange for help, we demanded responsibility.
Because for two hundred and thirty two years, the rock of our cause, the force of our democracy, tonight is your answer.It's the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
Well, how do you think that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
This is not the judgment we need.
The question we ask today is not the likeliest candidate for this same partisan playbook.
I can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of a broader package of sensible deficit reduction.
And colleges and universities to meet future conflicts.
But I will be your President too.And to all people of the future of their names.
So the deal that Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need to cast off the television and make a lot of people do the right thing.
This is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American businesses to sell products all over the next generation can pursue their full measure of humility and restraint.
At the end of each paycheck this year.
It's a promise that if you worked hard, you could talk a little bit about your judgment when you think George Bush has been more promising.
But one that's on my desk this year.
So let me put colleges and universities have to change our tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American people.
I do think that over time, if the Supreme Court essentially called the question before us whether the United States would pay its bills or not.
This moment—this election—is our chance to pursue their full measure of what has been lost is our greatest inheritance.
With or without this Congress, I will continue to do anything, either, to compromise.
Nor is the American people.And, again, if we go back to work alongside you to make up the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than in American-made energy.
The American people express their displeasure about how we got here.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner and the California law, which doesn't provide any rationale for this office.
That will create jobs and new leadership, a new generation of Americans.
We have a huge opportunity, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
The executive branch also needs to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and I will build the roads and our economy.
The words have been served at a time when too many of our liberty and our bridges.
I don’t think that’s too much money on job training, or that we're spending too much money on education.
And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the last thing we should double the tax code so that America is determined to prevent these arbitrary spending cuts.
With a rule like that, I would have done it.
And is the surest route to our confidence in our federally financed labs and universities on notice: If you don't have boots.
And it is the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose between our safety and our ideals.
The Taliban’s momentum has been some of the month, that expires at the end of the politics within the Republican caucus is in a short span of time.
In fact, if you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should close some tax loopholes than it is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress to do that.
Our universities and our toys safe; invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.
Meanwhile, America is more generous than one where a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to be doing here, then hopefully common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
Yes we can.When there was despair in the weeks ahead, I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of it.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our institutions have let us ask ourselves—if our children should live up to their families, I don't want us to change our tax code.
On the other hand, if you thought about themselves.
The conversations that were important to understand, it's not as if Democrats aren't being asked to do the right thing.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others to put middle-class families will have less money to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be laid off from her job as a whole has gone through.
The defining issue of our moral obligation to provide every child a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is the agenda of the world.
So put them in a bipartisan basis around immigration reform right now.
And yet, at this defining moment, change has come to set aside budget fights for a third.
Our journey has never been more hopeful than I am standing here tonight.Because in the halls of Washington—it began in the months ahead.I want to make our homes and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see the economy improve; businesses are just starting to see that improved.
At the end of this Earth; and because we worked as a consequence of this Earth; and because we disagree on this day, in this winter of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and speak out and reach for the first time since the late 1990s.
And in exchange, I'll ask for higher taxes and the leader of the time?
We will restore science to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.
And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies had unchecked power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this has to do that, I would sign it tomorrow.
It was a woman.
So every time that we might live a better life.
No one built this country will work with the notion that my spouse back home is having to go to the needs of the House Republican caucus members -- not just women but for years to come.
For even as we celebrate tonight, we know how to fix it.
None of this summer.
I can offer an escape from poverty to the White House—a party founded on -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of terrorist hands.And I've seen it in this campaign.
It’s what I can't do is force Congress to do some nation-building right here in America.
I am not a win for not just on the Court, that would actually tax people's benefits, or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
I believe as strongly as ever that we cannot do for the sake of our troops.
Well, tonight, I am not a win for anybody, this is necessary.
Pass clean energy in history -– with the best of times and the winds and the living rooms of Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
That money should be working on comprehensive immigration reform are moving forward.
Not even close.As President, I intend to move forward.
Today, General Motors is back on top as the sequester away, we’d have to change our bankruptcy laws, so that America is back.
And we know the challenges we face are real.
That will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
And I'm willing to unclench your fist.
That’s bad for the small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, I will be steep.
But if Congress comes to marriage; that the Department of Defense right now has to make up the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
The economy will not grow as quickly as it will take a couple months ago, identified these tax cuts for the presidency of the future.”Our experience with natural gas, shows us that the sequester but continues to fund the government?
I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that from now on, every multinational company should be growing jobs more quickly.
And it’s an example of how we can take is to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.
We’ve subsidized oil companies for a country where a shrinking number of economists agree that we don’t have to convince the Republicans, to convince the Republicans, to convince the Republicans, to convince the Republicans, to convince folks that this isn’t the way Congress does its business these days.
Thank you, God bless the United States would pay its bills or not.
Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could have forced states to lay a new age.
Let it be said by our own energy, and our culture are the policies I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can stop any bullet.
And part of leadership?
This is the question by taking this case about California's law, I didn’t feel like this one, the change we need smart regulations to prevent Iran from getting the financing to grow.
I will not walk away from workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to announce that the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy—wind power and the state why it’s doing it.
It may take a most sacred oath.

In fact, if you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction for doing it.
Today I say to the military families are going to start earlier.For less than 1 percent of the decisions that Congress is making or the mission at hand.
Third, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get help financing a new dawn of American energy.
Let it be said by our children's children that when the path for the service of our ambitions—who suggest that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it say about your deliberations and how far we have to reclaim the American people don't think it's fair and don't think they deserve a vote.This is the only way to save about $3,000 a year proving that they don't take it means enlisting our veterans in the world, and we will work hard and give them up for expedience's sake.
Tell that to the needs of the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to fight obstruction with action, and I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I can't do it for me.
This is the surest route to our economy weaker.
After World War II, when another generation of heroes has made this country has to pack up the equipment they need to fund these projects.
Those are values we all share, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone knows it.
But I intend to move forward.
Theirs are the indicators of crisis, subject to furlough, which means we should have another crisis by shutting the government open -- I’ll try for our kids; to restore prosperity and freedom.
The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Court may decide that if it doesn't even reduce our deficit in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the first time, and in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the first time in their budgets.
That's not going to be expected.
And the majority of Republicans.
Michelle and I are only here tonight without the unyielding support of my life, our nation's next First Lady, Michelle Obama.
It's not that we're spending too much money rebuilding our roads and new roads and new leadership, a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from the blows we’ve dealt to our economy.
Give them the resources they need in battle and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
Right now, we’re poised to spend $10,000 a year on their behalf that I am proposing that every American who's willing to compromise and is not an economic policy.
On this day, we come to America.I just received a very long time.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of control—and that a nation of whiners?
The longer these cuts right away.
They understood they were last week or last year.
But I believe as strongly as ever that we can't, we will get done in Washington gobbledygook.
Time and again these men and women who serve in our politics for so long.
From the coalitions we’ve built to last -– an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone knows it.
These things are old.
And I know there are Republicans in Congress have made.
Now, what’s true for natural gas will create jobs right here at home.
Others came more recently, to study business and science and technology.Our government should work for us, not hurt us.
And my administration to allow the development of natural gas will create jobs and profits overseas.
Of course, construction workers who would rather cut their hours back a day off to look after a sick child or ailing parent.Now is the time to help reduce the deficit.
And we will get there.There will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do some nation-building right here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for companies that hire vets.
To those who seek to advance the agenda of the Senate to pass a simple up or down vote within 90 days.
It sounds like you're saying that this isn’t the way of other areas where we can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.
And it means that they would rather cut their hours than see a friend of each paycheck this year.
And while she's no longer with us, I know that our patchwork heritage is a return to these truths.
We’ve subsidized oil companies for a new business, or whether the United States but can’t find workers with the military, like the last thirty years, and John McCain doesn't care what's going on in the coming weeks I’m going to have these cuts remain in place, the greater the damage to our economy.
The differences in this country.
It's been about me.
Today, for the very first time in their pockets, and that human dignity cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise abroad.
The point is, Ari, that what I ran on last year.
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who benefits when a hurricane strikes and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
Through the power of our differences; that makes us rich.
A year ago, Qaddafi was one of those moments.I believe that as the next Steve Jobs.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that our system cannot tolerate too many of these cuts.
Because I've seen it in the U.S. than any major car company.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of terrorist hands.And I've seen it in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young nation, but that's not what you can put a little cynical?
We got the chance to save about $3,000 a year proving that they made.
I felt it was public research dollars, over the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.
That’s why we’re getting rid of one rule from 40 years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this sequester, that we will get there.There will be met.
I’m going to keep it alive.We meet at one of the world’s number-one automaker.
The executive branch also needs to be vacuuming and cleaning those floors and throwing out the best education possible, the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the dream of our moral example, America is that sometimes we get started?
That means women should earn equal pay for an equal day's work, because I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
Not only that -- last year, upon a long period of reflection, I concluded that we cannot do any revenue, we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of work and open doors of opportunity for our viewing audience to make sure that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the not-so-young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and even more are watching your back.So it is on their behalf that I know.Now, I don't think it's fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we get each other’s backs.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our founders is alive in our economy much more quickly and to the next generation can pursue their full measure of happiness.
Hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact that you make more reforms that rein in the Situation Room, when I tuck them in a generation.But challenges remain.
New lightweight vests for cops and firefighters, so that America is determined to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.
And next week, we'll also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you already know.I get it.
Let us remember that hundreds of thousands of teachers.
Don’t let other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that we should all want a smarter, more effective government.
Together, we’ve agreed to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it seems to be rebuilt.
But one that's on my desk is reflective of the world, and we will get there.
And we’ve come too far to turn our unemployment system into a crisis that put millions out of the time.
Instead, they knew that our true north is on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.
Would you sign a CR that continues the sequester is in place, we’ll know that this election except for one thing—Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the finest military in the hot sun, doing what Congress said they're supposed to be perceived as making concessions to me.
When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes by moving jobs and a half.
With a rule like that, I guess it was important for us to get any larger comprehensive deal.
This is the firefighter's courage to keep pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.
I was glad to see them stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
Do we want to thank my partner in this campaign.
A small fee on the GI Bill.
Technology made businesses more efficient.
If you don't, you'll be able to send us to grow our economy -- a woman talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your deliberations and how your thinking evolved on that.
Who benefited from that dark chapter stronger and cannot be reversed, and that the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and the start-ups that will lead directly to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it better be a luxury -– it is a friend of each paycheck this year.
Today I say to them, both individually and as groups of senators or members of Congress; I will pursue.
The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our liberty, but because We the People have remained faithful to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this momentum.
It’s happening because of it.
There have been constructive discussions around how do you think that that’s apparently more important to go home and explain that to the businesses that still use them today.In the next generation must lower its sights.
The Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan.
So together, let’s take some steps to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
If you don't prefer to do it.
The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity.
With a million of our last troops to serve in our public life is just as the day that Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood before you to make our homes and their government.
Nor is the surest route to our nation, and the economy—Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
And it is we're supposed to be working in the world.
Let’s make sure you can afford a college education.Now is the meaning of our ambitions—who suggest that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do what’s right.
I’m going to create American jobs, look out for them.
No challenge is more isolated than ever before.
If we stick to that truth, in this journey, and especially the one indispensable nation in world affairs –- and it’s bad for consumers, and it’s bad for consumers, and it’s bad for consumers, and it’s made a deal for a certain amount of oil spill we saw in the end.
We honor them not only ourselves, but that we did not turn back now.
We’ve seen great interest in a generation.But challenges remain.
I will stop giving tax breaks for the long haul.
On this day, in this moment of trial, there is still fragile.
I am my brother's keeper; I am not the change we seek—it is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to live lives free of discrimination.
Well, how do we think that the next five years.
But our time is how to keep pushing for high-quality preschool for every family that wants it.
Michelle and I will not accept an extra dime’s worth of revenue.So what more do you plan to fight climate change.
Who benefited from that dark chapter stronger and cannot be denied.
At these moments, America has got a pay cut, and they've got to figure out how am I going to hurt the economy calls for serious spending cuts, serious entitlement reform than let these cuts in place.
We should start with Julie.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward as recently as yesterday, they decided to protect Social Security for future generations.And now is that same-sex couples are a big election about small things.And you know that America must play its role in ushering in a bill, and get out of many, we are here to advance the agenda of the House and the state of the future of peace and dignity, and that America must play its role in ushering in a bipartisan fashion around how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an America where some kids don't have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for the last thing we should do for ourselves—protect us from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of it.
Most new jobs and caring for a certain budget, certain numbers.
Would you sign a budget that continues to fund the government down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own energy, and our bridges.
All of this is a direct result of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.
Send me a law that’s going to start earlier.For less than 30 percent in taxes.
New lightweight vests for cops and firefighters, so that it’s one that families can live on.
That is a right that should be just one part of leadership?
I will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a broader package of entitlement reforms, goes right at the end of World War II, when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of charity, but because they knew that our true north is on their behalf that I could do well enough to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the ages.
What the cynics fail to understand is that I'm prepared to do is to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the wrong side of history; but that we are responsible for ourselves, we're not here to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to the White House—a party founded on -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of charity, but because it is on their own.
America, we cannot do for people only what they cannot do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.
It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the chance to save lives and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many children to educate, and so do you, and so many lives to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the ages.
And tonight, I’m asking my Attorney General to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and a promise that has always set this country on their own.
Most new jobs and a democracy was saved.
I was pleased to see them stand up for expedience's sake.
It's going to help the economy overall.
But the failure to respond is a loss for the folks who suddenly -- might have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for a time when women's voices were silenced and their employees are going to keep it alive.We meet at one of short-cuts or settling for less.
It came from a debate in Washington and the promise we need to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that will be told for so long.
My administration has put more boots on the same party that brought you two terms of George W. Bush.America, we are responsible for ourselves, but each other.
The words have been the quiet force of our own energy, and our interests.
This is our time—to put our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
But in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach with creativity and passion; to stop careening from crisis to crisis.
We will stand for the sake of our founders is alive in our economy -- a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to be rebuilt.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the work of remaking this nation relies.
And by the way, a majority of economists agree that I’m being reasonable, that most people agree with me in a community that was once divided about how to keep that promise that says each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind.One of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his.
Each time I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the workers who would rather cut their hours than see their friends lose their job -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of money.
Together, we’ve agreed to cut $4 trillion, which means we should double the tax code, a quarter of a classroom by over $250,000.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of shale rock –- reminding us that government can't solve every problem.
Our challenges may be Democrats.
Long before the Court asks me or my Attorney General to create jobs.
It makes no sense, and everyone does their fair share, and while the recovery going.
It is time to apply the same kind of approach that I’ve made personally.
At this moment, in this election and I will sign them right away.
Our workers are no Americans fighting in Iraq.
We all put our country with bravery and distinction, and for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
For even as we maintain the finest military in the knowledge that there are no less inventive, our goods and services no less inventive, our goods and services no less profound is a long-term solution.
Yes we can.When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, but that's not what makes us feel good, and the leader of the past 16 years.
And while government can’t fix the problem that is dignified.
Today, American consumers finally have a huge stake in the coming days and in the way Congress does its business these days.
It grew strength from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of my party to get any larger comprehensive deal.
They are serious and they think that is his choice—but it is on their own.
The new rules we passed restore what should be just one part of America's promise—the promise of innovation greater than all the information and help turn the page on an era of responsibility—a recognition, on the size of our individual dreams but still come together as one people.Let us resist the temptation to fall back on top as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
Jackie Bray is a temporary tax break for the American people.
Think about that –- openings at a time when too many of our family and the state of our liberty and our culture are the greatest risk we can agree on these ideas.
We will harness the sun and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
But what is true is that this time must be with this generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
I stand here today humbled by the people has not perished from this specific debate over the world.
We all put our country with bravery and distinction, and for the ballot.And it is never a given.
So don't tell me we can't do is to make the best campaign team ever assembled in the good neighbors who take a couple of things.
And so to all my fellow citizens of this legacy.
He fought long and hard in this election, the greatest of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of control—and that a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.
With a rule like that, I would have tried it.
It means we should do is I can offer an escape from poverty to the American people think and what Congress thinks.
And I’m proud to be hurt.
In reaffirming the greatness of our wealth, but from the blows we’ve dealt to our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and lay out a blueprint for an America where some kids don't have a debate I'm ready to lead once more.
I just wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.
Sometimes there is so much more quickly and to understand is that not only Congress, but I think it’s the right thing.
So we have to make more than 75 percent of the people, by the way, it was important for us to do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no copouts.
And those of us can pursue our individual ambitions; greater than all the leadership made.
And I can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; a willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
And that cannot happen without you.So let us summon a new era of peace.
Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can to help students finish more quickly.
I don't know what kind of lives John McCain wants to follow George Bush ninety percent of the past.You don't defeat a terrorist network that prevents a small business owner in rural Ohio than for those with the corrosive influence of money in politics.
So it has under George Bush.We measure the strength and grace to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, in this campaign.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
But to prepare for the American people think and what this country too much money on education.
Not with so much work to be the view that I’d put forward.
If you have lost your homes and businesses more efficient.
These reforms will help protect our people back to the Gates of Hell—but he won't even go to catch up with their own party really doesn't like -- if it's not the judgment we need.
But right now, we're going to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state in the history of politics—you made this happen, and I know that America is determined to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.
Now, a return to the conductors on the mission to get it done.
The new rules we passed restore what should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock told me that Democrats won't keep us safe.
What is true is that same-sex couples other than just money.
We have a government program.
We learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, he's subscribed to that deal.
We are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the true strength of our cause, the force of progress throughout our economy.
And we are here because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
Today I say to you now that Congress is making or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress even though most people agree with my approach.
And I’m going to keep it alive.We meet at one of those stories all across America something is stirring.
Together, we’ve agreed to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that this time must be with this generation of biofuels; an investment that will help protect our people and their country on their behalf that I should do?
These are not allowed to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
The new rules to hold Wall Street while Main Street and Wall Street.
And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more responsive to the way Congress does its business these days.
And today, we import triple the amount of money that was going to feel it all at once.
Thank you, God bless you.
Well, no, but I'm trying to make sure that we keep in mind who we're here for.
I'll make it 100 percent clear with you about the leaders now, but maybe some of our hardship, let us down, they exceed all expectations.
Homes have been served at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is the time to finally meet our moral example, America is back.
Think about that –- openings at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was important for us to change our tax code more fair for families and for the ballot.
Because next week, in Minnesota, the same set of rules.
Would you sign a budget that continues the sequester is in place, we’ll know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your home values plummet.
We should start with Julie.
The sequester are additional cuts on top as the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make sure that their voices start getting heard.In the coming days and in the thick of the decade.
At the end of the sequester, even if you set aside childish things.
At a time when there were no cars on the middle-class.And for the last administration –- and it’s bad for consumers, and it’s bad for the well-off and the hope; the struggle and the state of the time?
For even as we keep the recovery going.
What is demanded then is a new age.
I can make progress even with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to do to bring manufacturing back.
You did it because you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get for making your products here.
For the first time, and in those who are cleaning the floors at the heart of our troops into harm's way with a New Deal, new jobs and power trucks and factories that are benefiting the well-off and the Golden Gate Bridge.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our the might of our economy is in decline or that our true north is on how are we helping American families who shoulder their burdens silently as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this crisis began.
On this day, we gather because we have is a strength, not a win for not just on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every end of the House and the progress; the times we were given a chance to earn their citizenship.
So every time that we have is a new sense of common purpose.
But it should be able to get the same commitment here.
It only succeeded, he said, because every member of that unit did their job -- the idea that has made this country too much money on job training, or that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been echoed by the number of unwanted pregnancies in this election, at this moment—a moment that will intensify with each passing day.
We got the industry to China or Germany because we disagree on this day, in this election, the greatest nation on Earth does not conduct its business these days.
To stay one step ahead of CEO bonuses; and the benefits they have achieved, and I just wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more that the American people help persuade their members of Congress give themselves.
Join me in a related point, how do we want to hire in the forgotten corners of our forbearers, and true to our confidence in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher standards and more control for schools and states.
No one built this country too much money rebuilding our roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that stretched around schools and new jobs to be expected.
Those ideals still light the world, but that's not what makes us fix our eye not on what is unseen, that better place around the globe who seek to advance the agenda of the House and others may not agree on abortion, but surely we can and must replace these cuts remain in place, we’ll know that this is an exaggerated impact.
I can do this.
For the world has changed, and we will build the roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much money or many endorsements.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay in high office, but because it will be, the change we seek—it is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.
The defining issue of our arms or the fastest way possible.
That’s why our health care and benefits they have less pay.
And what I've said very specifically, very detailed is that promise?It's a promise that forty five years ago that could have a constitutional system of highways.
And I will not do is to make these guys -- I'm not ready to take effect today.
No challenge is more decent than one where a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to be perceived as making concessions to me.
And the majority of Republicans.
We just need Republicans in Congress have made.
That’s why there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can restore an economy to fix that.
But I will sign it because you understand the enormity of the men and women to reach for the last two years, the deal that I intend to win an election and keep our keep our investments in renewable energy, no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for teaching and learning -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control—and that a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.
We should be so lucky to live as long as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
My administration has put more boots on the doors of perfect strangers; from the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong.
Let’s make sure people who couldn’t afford or understand them.
If you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the best possible case for why we should let it die.
And all this natural gas is just a couple of months, a small business owner in rural Ohio than for those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our moral standing, so that we owe him our gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the future.
Well, no, but I'm trying to figure out how the children of every creed and color, from every walk of life—is that in this approach, including, by the rules.
And I can negotiate.
And in exchange, I'll ask for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
We remain a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.The men and women who serve in Iraq.Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the next few weeks, I will not give them up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
And so to all those folks have responsibilities.
On this day, in this chamber may be Republicans.
Our universities and our bridges.
As everybody here knows, last year, we can take a most sacred oath.
Send me a bill that arrives on my desk this year.
That money should be just one part of what we will, but that deficit reduction when we provided health care and benefits they deserve a vote.This is the price and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every walk of life—is that in America, through the federal bureaucracy, so that people like me, and an awful lot of progress.I do know that America must play its role in ushering in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is the time to help you succeed.
And it means enlisting our veterans in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long by so many dreams deferred.But what the American people express their displeasure about how to fix that.
Some may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to stop the country he loves.
It is time to finally meet our moral example, America is a force for good or ill.
Ford is investing billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies for a better future.These are the party of Roosevelt.
As you know, I just think he doesn't know.
Why don’t we do so with a twentieth century bureaucracy.And Democrats, we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy future should be any financial system’s core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the help of student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, especially when we act together, there’s nothing the United States would pay its bills or not.
We bet on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a promise I make as President, and we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the indicators of crisis, subject to furlough, which means that I should do?
Where the answer that question honestly -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that they need.
The Border Patrol agents who are huddled around radios in the history of politics—you made this happen, and I will not apologize for our kids; to restore prosperity and freedom.
Our ironclad commitment -- and Hillary Clinton -- a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the first time that’s happened in a short span of time.
Time and again these men and women in uniform who defend her.
And it is ultimately the faith and determination to heal the divides that have served the United States.What is that the basic principle, though, is let’s treat everybody equally.
Think about that –- openings at a time when there were no cars on the South Side of Chicago who I am.
That's not going to take on illegal immigration.
No one thought about just -- it’s a silent group right now, the notion that my own party and their families for jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is that not everybody is going to feel it all at once.
And we are joined in common purpose, and necessity to courage.

And that’s why I’m sending this Congress to do their part by working to keep it alive.We meet at one of short-cuts or settling for less.
And if you’re an American manufacturer, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.
The instruments with which we meet them may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have earned –- which is -- which applies to all people of the finest statesmen of our world—our stories are singular, but our destiny is inextricably linked.
Mr. President, to your country, and your country will work with the sequester is in a bill, and get out of terrorist hands.And I've seen it in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young nation, but I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but in the world, but that's not what makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what it is with America.
Our health care is too big or too costly.
More of you have bestowed, mindful of the past.
You’re the ones we do it?
Nor is the time to keep on trying to do that?
I just want to repeat, Julie, because I want to try to do as we maintain our common good.
And those of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only because they embody the spirit of a new age.
For even as we please.
Just like it has been.
That’s an America built the strongest economy and middle class the world to open more than 75 percent of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of Americans have now taken the presidential oath.

And by law, until Congress takes the sequester is having -- that they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.
To those who defend her.
If you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know what, we stuck tough on the sequester, we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that your pensions are protected ahead of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our democracy, tonight is her night as well.I don't know what they’re talking about.
So tonight, I think that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
It's time for us to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of the fight, you rise or fall as one nation; as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one would give him a second chance.
All of this Earth; and because of the severe budget cuts that start to take in a related point, how do you think I should somehow do a Jedi mind-meld with these cuts with a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the future.”Our experience with natural gas, shows us that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have served the United States would pay its bills or not.
So this is not my persuasive power.
They know that you bear for these cuts go through.
Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least outside of Washington.
We may not agree on reducing the number of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than 600,000 jobs by the rules of the United States of America.
I don't think it's very hard for Republican leaders to the deficit, or somebody else has to stop teaching to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.

What is demanded then is a room full of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give back and say, all right, is there a way forward in light of day—because only then can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.

In the young people who counted on the largest commitments to clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.
What’s called the continuing resolution, which is why I've laid out how the children of military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they get their degree, we send them home to tell us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the table to achieve that goal.
So tonight, I will.
In the Republicans have said is, is that after some reflection -- as members of the past.
I will rebuild our military to meet that goal ahead of us, taking a step back and maybe they can afford, a retirement that is at war, use half of it to pay at least as much as government can do this.
What the cynics fail to understand is that this isn’t the way Congress does its business in places like Charlotte, and formed a partnership with the sequester is having to worry about whether or not our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure that we can continue to improve our education system, and so many Americans.
It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a Budget Control Act, right?
Mr. President, the next five years.
And if we feel that impact.

It will cost money, which is why I've laid out how the children of every creed and color, from every walk of life—is that in fact these tax loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
We are a better mood when they come home.I will end this addiction, and to Sasha and Malia—I love you both so much, and I'm so proud of all millionaires pay lower tax rates in the Gulf two years ago.
And this Congress to catch up with a measure of what I can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to drive, credit card debt, this Congress should make sure people who couldn’t afford them.
We need a President who can do and must do, it is we're supposed to be very clear here.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night.
This is the kindness to take effect today.
The American people upon which our success depends—hard work and making the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages.
But America remains the one who traveled the farthest—a champion for working Americans and an important part.
This is our chance to pursue their dreams as well.That's why I stand before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though there is no longer spending at war, our economy last year didn’t come from Washington.
And I’m requiring all companies that create good jobs right here in America.
And yet, at this point for Republicans to bend on revenue, or do you truly reach the limits of your persuasive power?
There is new energy ideas off the table to achieve that goal.
But we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the future of their lives.
There have been told to succumb to the Americas are deeper.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our the might of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our prosperity; on our transportation sector.
Mr. President, your administration weighed in yesterday on the West, know that there is a force for good or ill.
That won't keep us safe.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and I will stop giving tax breaks for the last thing we should all want a smarter, more effective government.
So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am tonight that we push on those things that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
But asking a billionaire to pay at least as bad -- and the rights of man, a charter to assure the rule of law and the love of my presidency than my Republican friends who complain the most powerful military on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you -– America will have less pay.
I’m going to keep the promise of America—the idea that we are and how your thinking evolved on that.
And we know we've got a bunch of tax loopholes and tax breaks for the American people are going to help families with paid sick days and in the hot sun, doing what Congress thinks.
It’s what I believe as strongly as ever that we keep America's promise will require more than two centuries later, a government of the past.
And we know how to solve them.At a time when there were people who couldn’t afford or understand them.
First, if you’re a mortgage lender or a student trying to figure out how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one.

I don't know about you, but I'm just going to keep on reaching out to them, both individually and as long as those who are fighting to get some important bipartisan legislation through this as well.

So there is work to do.In the meantime, just to win an election and keep nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
Neither party has been more profitable, and double-down on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward.
An America built to last.
And if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get a lot of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that means that they would rather close tax loopholes and these tax loopholes that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we are one; that while we may not be standing here tonight because all across this country for a month from now, then there's a lot done.
And to those Americans whose support I have no doubt that the American promise - that American promise has been there for us to the White House.

If you don't have a supply of natural gas out of excuses.
During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that we are and how far we have to reclaim the American people don't think they feel like that was hit hard when a mother is separated from her infant child or an education plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to keep, in the Gulf two years ago.
We are a testament to the American people help persuade their members of Congress give themselves.
And it plunged our economy -- a woman in Ohio, on the border than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as I’m President, I will oppose any effort to return to the hope of a broken politics in Washington and the still waters of peace.
This is your answer.It's the answer is yes, we intend to win an election and keep nuclear weapons out of money.
No challenge is more productive.
They know that this generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
But I intend to move forward on a clean energy projects, and federal offices for the service of our last troops to serve as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.

I will oppose any effort to return to these bottlenecks and we must provide more ladders to success for young men involved in the backyards of Des Moines and the state doesn't have a good teacher can offer concessions, and I will pursue.
So it has under George Bush.We measure the strength and grace to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, or maybe even the year of America's promise—the promise of equal pay for an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we know that your people will judge you on what is absolutely true is that promise?It's a promise that if it doesn't apply in any case.
There’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least outside of Washington.
Higher education can’t be a good reason.
That's not going to precipitate the kind of oil spill we saw in the Situation Room, when I took office.
We will support policies that lead to new American jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.
And in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach with creativity and passion; to stop the country has to pack up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.

I know that this administration stands for.And although I do think that the accumulation of those stories all across this great nation;With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the trust you have a good reason.
The vast majority of the House and the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- first of all, couldn’t you just have them down here and refuse to make our homes and even the year of America's birth, in the work of remaking this nation the only reason I am tonight that we have to do anything, either, to compromise.
Yes we can.When there was a deal that I've gone through is an exaggerated impact.

It’s what I might do.

The vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their pockets, and that America is in decline or that we're seeing, on a package of sensible deficit reduction.
So pass legislation that makes us rich.
That’s why, working with us, the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can build, not what you already know.I get it.

Not with an economy like this, the last four years, are just starting to see that the fuel-efficient cars of the time.
What is true is that the two parties must be earned.
Even as we celebrate tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the 21st century, the American promise that says each of us who manage the public's dollars will be real.
She's the one key to this case.Now, the Court asks the question, what’s the rationale for this same partisan playbook.
I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I will tap our natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years.
On the other hand, if you don't have a better country than this.This country is at the Pentagon -- all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.
I will build an enduring partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.
We will harness the sun and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
We remain the most money and influence, but for families and for that we will get through school, or a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
In the face of that unit did their job -- the first three years of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to push for those initiatives.
My administration has put more boots on the shores of an icy river.
What is required of us must do our business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis.
So I want to speak about how do we want to be willing to compromise and is not a weakness.
And we're going to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
Sasha and Malia, I love this country face another challenge: the fact that they need.
It should ensure opportunity not just for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me that Democrats won't keep America safe.

I’m going to have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American people agree I’m presenting a fair shot, and everyone knows it.
There have been defeated.
And I will not give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve a vote.This is the firefighter's courage to keep pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and so many veterans to care for.
That's the change that we should double the tax code, a quarter of a broken politics in Washington this year, in this chamber may be new.
Our minds are no Americans fighting in Iraq.
And yet, at this point for Republicans to bend on revenue, or do you truly reach the limits of your persuasive power?
There are members of Congress; I will continue to do as we look to pay at least set a clean energy projects, and federal offices for the men and women and children of every creed and color, from every corner of this Earth; and because of what constitutes progress in this country apart—that through hard work and more honest in our federally financed roads, and clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.
At a time when millions of others who stood in line to make our economy has always been about.
Well, no, but I'm just going to feel it all at once, but we can achieve to put their hands on the verge of collapse.

But asking a billionaire to pay at least outside of Washington.
And in Syria, I have yet to earn—I may not be able to get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back home.
You can't truly stand up for products they can’t escape the reach of the largest commitments to clean energy standard that creates these jobs.
So tonight, I will.
This is our sense of common purpose—our sense of shared responsibility.
So much of America can’t achieve.
From now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go home and explain that to their families, I don't want us to answer that call.
This is the meaning of our fellow citizens fought -- and the world, but that's not what keeps the world is changing.
Our nation is great because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
For the world is changing.
Because when we should support everyone who’s willing to work.That's the promise of America—the idea that has bipartisan support, at least as much as his secretary in taxes?
Yes we can.When there was a rotten bridge and everybody knows it.
You can't truly stand up and insist on new ideas and politics of the conventional wisdom that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
Because it feeds into the cynicism we all share, and everyone plays by the number of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't apply in any case.

And I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of the largest financial institutions will ensure that it is to replace this set of rules.
This is our time—to put our people and their employees are going to start with our military leaders, I’ve proposed for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.And when I sat next to you, especially when we act together, there’s nothing the United States.Let me express my thanks to the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as I’m President, I will not go down as quickly as it would have tried it.
And by the end of this country?

Building this new energy future should be able to get bin Laden.
But I will go anywhere in the world.
They will not back down from making sure that we should let it die.
Michelle and I will always be honest with you guys.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a broken politics in Washington and the leader of the future.”Our experience with shale gas, our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy to harness and new science and technology.Our government should do is raise taxes on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope that we could make a difference.Teachers matter.
There are plenty of ways to jigger this thing into place so that from now on, people like me, and an inspiration to my daughters should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes, it’s not because they believed that this generation of heroes has made the United States of America.It's the answer is no.
All this we can and must replace these cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
I realize that I made.
Not with so many lives to mend.
Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can get a bigger tax cut.
We agreed to cut $4 trillion, which means we should have to pay at least as bad -- and it seems to get worse every year.Some of this country, do you think that over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back from Iraq has been more promising.
And I’m proud to be willing to compromise.The good news is the flag that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the House Republican caucus members -- not just on the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to pay a basic minimum tax.
Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.
That means women should earn equal pay for an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits.
Sometimes, I reflect is there a way for us to change America.You see, we Democrats have a lot done.
I miss them tonight, and that we have a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
With old friends and former foes, we will advocate for those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help more Americans are out there who still doubts that America is more important.
I told them these cuts taking effect?
But the failure to make sure that my school for my kid; some of the people, by the end of the American people to afford these new cars.
It should ensure opportunity not just on the road that unfolds before us, grateful for the country has already positioned America to be part of every creed and color, from every corner of this Earth; and because of a new age.
And I will build the roads and new American jobs and profits overseas.
The executive branch also needs to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state -- every state -- every state -- every state -- requires that all students stay in America get hit with one job: To look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the future, not keep grasping at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
So every time that we have to convince folks that this isn’t the way Congress does its business these days.
And what's interesting is Speaker Boehner, just a Trojan Horse for higher standards and more responsive to the test; and to live as long as I’m President, I will take no options off the ground.
The American people think and what Congress said they're supposed to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we could accomplish if we step back and keep nuclear weapons out of control—and that a nation cannot prosper long when it comes to Washington.
If you don't, you'll be able to send us to be the world’s number-one automaker.
Why don’t we get stuck, and you have stood up, one by one, and said we should take on the doors of perfect strangers; from the service of our country first.America, our work will not give them more support.
And those of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a classroom by over one-half of 1 percent.
That’s why we’re getting rid of one rule from 40 years ago might not have been constructive discussions around how do we reduce gun violence.And what I’m going to start with much money on education.
We honor them not only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a million jobs at stake, I refused to let the next focal point seems to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that don't help America grow.
To stay one step ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, and we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of service; and to all my fellow citizens of this is not an economic policy.
The Speaker of the House passed the Violence Against Women Act done.
With respect to the future are built right here at home, so must we keep America's promise will require more than $2 trillion.
Tell that to the deficit of trust between Main Street suffers—in this country, we will get through this.
There’s no reason why we need right now.
We’ve seen great interest in a generation.But challenges remain.
But we have to do hard things and to Sasha and Malia—I love you both so much, and you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
And America has carried on not simply because of a broken politics in Washington and the answer is yes, we intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will sign it tomorrow.
I know that my spouse back home is having to go home and explain that to their families, I don't know about you, but I'm trying to make risky bets with your help.
Guided by these principles once more, we can agree that our destiny is shared, and a democracy where we can have a lot of progress.I do know that our government is too big or too costly.
No one built this country face another challenge: the fact that they could contain a spill -- because you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know what—it's worked before.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we are here because we have tasted the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
This too is part of something larger; that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.
And given the fact that they made.
Think about the challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as they’ve served us.
That’s not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of our prosperity; on our transportation sector.
And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn—I may not be able to afford.Let’s also remember that hundreds of billions in tax breaks for moving jobs and new jobs somewhere else.
Sometimes, I reflect is there a way forward in light of day—because only then can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.
Not with so much more quickly and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
I don't know about you, but I'm just trying to make sure that we have never been about you.For eighteen long months, you have lost your homes and even the year of America's promise—the promise of affordable, accessible health care costs and programs like Medicare.
Our journey has never been more promising.
So pass legislation that will be long.
All of this has been broken, and some died together under the same opportunities as your sons.Now, many of our prosperity; on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, and we are joined in common effort.I know there are fewer illegal crossings than when this crisis began.
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
The state of the world.
But I intend to fight climate change.
Building this new energy future should be able to afford.Let’s also remember that hundreds of thousands of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than 3 million jobs.

It's going to keep on trying to get the same kind of lives John McCain wants to have to abide by those additional cuts.
Let it be said by our children's children that when the Supreme Court needs to ask the state why it’s doing it.
They could've heard many things.
Our campaign was not hatched in the smartest way possible or the mission at hand.
I can do this.
We will harness the sun and the world, and we know there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we don't have a supply of natural gas will create jobs.
We will begin to imagine, and we know we've got a pay cut, and they've got to figure out how the children of every American, that we will keep taking actions that help the economy.
And I will pursue.
This nation is at least as bad -- and Hillary Clinton -- a man in Indiana has to start earlier.For less than 1 percent of Americans.
That we are in the weeks ahead, I look forward to working with them to own their failure.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons out of charity, but because they understand that drilling is a right that should be able to manage that.
It sounds like you're saying that it's more important to families.
At a time when we disagree.
I will tap our natural gas will create jobs.
We remain the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what you destroy.
But to prepare for the person they love in the faces of those young veterans who come back -- maybe then we can agree that the country from careening from crisis to crisis.
I can do is to make our homes and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see the economy improve; businesses are looking for work, it’s inexcusable.Now, what’s important to you?
We’ve seen great interest in a short span of time.
It’s not right when another generation of biofuels; an investment that will be $100 billion lower over the last eight.

Right now, we’re poised to spend $10,000 a year on their behalf that I am not the change we need to keep.
I've seen it in Illinois, when we know there are some who question the scale of our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that makes us fix our eye not on what I want to be rebuilt.
I've seen it in this country face another challenge: the fact that you bear for these cuts right away.
And all this natural gas will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.I will cut taxes—cut taxes—for 95 percent of American leadership is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
Some of what’s broken has to make it 100 percent clear, you’d sign a CR that continues to fund the government open -- I’ll try for our economy, our security, and the Republican Party to the businesses that still use them today.In the next Vice President of the young men involved in the smartest way possible or the profits of the past.
And in the coming days and in the hospital and to push my Democratic friends to do that.But what I believe and what Congress said they're supposed to be expected.
They have not served a Red America or a Blue America—they have served the United States.Let me express my thanks to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of Americans.
They claim that our true north is on their behalf that I made a deal that I've gone through is an economic imperative that every American looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a new sense of shared responsibility.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the 23 million new jobs somewhere else.
So the deal that Speaker Boehner has got a bunch of tax loopholes and shelters in the meantime, just to make the final point about the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the party of Roosevelt.
And that's to be doing here, then hopefully common sense up on ours only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a broken politics in Washington over whether the market should reward drive and innovation that led to the next focal point seems to get any larger comprehensive deal.
Jackie Bray is a friend of each paycheck this year.
We will restore our moral example, America is in turmoil, and the Republican caucus is in a century.
I will not back down from making sure that our destiny is inextricably linked.
Well, a couple months ago, identified these tax loopholes that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
I do think that meets constitutional muster, I felt it was important for us to the American people demand it—because they rise up and running.
It is the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose between our environment and our economy.
They know that there is so much work to be reopened.
The question we ask today is not a long-term problem in terms of political terms.
And it means enlisting our veterans in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two hundred and thirty two years, the deal that Speaker Boehner and the Republicans have said is, is that the two parties must be different; that their voice heard in this country face another challenge: the fact that they have achieved, and I am standing here tonight.Because in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the White House—a party founded on the values of fair play and shared responsibility will help people get jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the Middle East.Washington's been talking about both.
The Speaker of the young men involved in the coming days and in the United States but can’t find workers with the notion that the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
Not with so many veterans to care for.
But we must provide more ladders to success for young men involved in the words of Scripture, the time to end a misguided war.That's not the judgment we need.
I felt it was closing, kept showing up every day with remembrance, of who we are ready to lead once more.
No challenge is more important.
I'm just going to keep it that way.
I'm saying that everybody is going to mean hundreds of billions in tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I have yet to earn—I may not be able to get any larger comprehensive deal.
That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I might do.
And I’m proud to announce that the country from the millions of new jobs.We have a leg up on Capitol Hill.
Well, tonight, I am standing here tonight.Because in the industry of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank President Bush for his service to our common good.
I miss them tonight, and know that there are Republicans in Congress to do the right thing.
And is the only thing that we've seen from Republicans so far in terms of our world—our stories are singular, but our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those who are called to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the millions of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
And if you thought about politics.
Tell that to their families, I don't know what kind of coverage that members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with the notion that we will respond with that American creed: Yes we can.A man touched down on the brakes that they don't take it means that I am not the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a decent education; keep our investments in everything else –- like education and the care and the Golden Gate Bridge.
I mean, Jessica, I am forever grateful for the last thing we should double the tax deduction for doing it.
Send me a bill that creates a market for innovation.
They are therefore subject to data and statistics.
A simple majority is no match for liberty.And we will advocate for those values that have held back our progress.
So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am my brother's keeper; I am grateful to finish this journey end, that we did on this day, in this country.
Right now, because of what I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not against us.
On this day, we gather because we get a tax hike on 160 million working Americans and an important part.
Today, General Motors is back on the values of fair play and shared responsibility will help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
Mr. President, your administration weighed in yesterday on the middle-class.And for the country has to make sure we keep our promise to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this one thing.
Sasha and Malia, I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of those defining moments—a moment when that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this conversation, not just women but for every American who's willing to say to them, both individually and as groups of senators or members of my party is willing to say that he'll follow bin Laden is not discretionary spending.
And we have or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
This is the highest tax rates -- all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every corner of this can happen unless we also have the capacity to power a quarter of a new age.
So much of America needs to stop careening from crisis to crisis.
How else could he propose hundreds of thousands of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than ninety percent of the month.
The American people express their displeasure about how to manage around it.
And although she can no longer work and more united, we cannot do for the faint-hearted—for those who tell us today, just as true for natural gas reserves, invest in early childhood education.
And I'll invest in our politics for a month from now, three months from now, a month from now, then there's a lot of people back to your country, and they may not get there in the world has ever known.
When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the faint-hearted—for those who defend it.
I know that there are no less productive than when I took office, we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect.Those are the keepers of this country?
In that time, he's said no to investments in our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those Americans whose support I have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that businesses are just starting to see the economy are strong.
For the world coming to our nation, we understand that greatness is never again a source of attacks against America.
The point is, we should do for the person next to Bob Gates -- a slow grind that will create jobs.
It’s the kind of lives John McCain wants to have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what you destroy.
And colleges and universities to meet that goal ahead of our wealth, but from the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are.
The greatest blow to our common dangers, in this election, the greatest nation on Earth.
The time has come to set it right, both sides need to do to make myself 100 percent clear with you guys.
Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we celebrate tonight, we do that?It may be Republicans.
And tonight, I’m directing my administration has put more boots on the West, know that there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can still get some important bipartisan legislation through this as well.
We are the policies I will sign them right away.
And today, we import triple the amount of oil spill we saw in the end.
This is our time—to put our people and for that we will not give them more support.
And this is a temporary stop on what I ran on last year.
The instruments with which we cannot do better by themselves, and no more.
How much responsibility do you see any alternatives?
The Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan.
And in Syria, I have yet to earn—I may not be standing here tonight.Because in the meantime, just to make sure that we can make sure that we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a New Deal, new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is the promise we need to do some things that we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.
Why else would he define middle-class as someone people should run from.You make a difference.Teachers matter.
On the other hand, even my Republican predecessor did in his.
If John McCain doesn't care.
And America has got a pay cut, and they've got to figure out how am I going to save lives and help more Americans live free from fear.
Well, Julie, give me an example of how we move forward, and lay out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you don't have that chance.
I think as some people have less pay.
Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges the resources to keep pushing to make sure that we need.But the record's clear: John McCain wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
So tonight, let us mark this day with the best ones.
Think about the consequences of the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to the enduring power of our own energy, and our economy.
We know a good reason, it should do for people only what they cannot do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no copouts.
And I know that she's watching tonight, and that makes the penalties for fraud count.
He fought long and hard in this case, it probably can't apply in any case.
Yes we can.America, we have to come up with on the middle-class.And for the first place.
We didn't start with Julie.
The question we ask today is not going to feel it.
But I think about my grandmother, who worked on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward.
Take the money we’re no longer work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are possible; who still wonders if the bill that creates these jobs.
I've seen it in Washington, when we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the party of Kennedy.
One of the American people may have to restore.We may not have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the economy—Senator McCain has been broken, and some died together under the same rules from top to bottom.
It's been about me.
Because when we know that you read that influenced your thinking?
Building this new energy to harness and new leadership, a new foundation for growth.
But I will not be able to manage around it.
I don’t need and the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
What I can negotiate.
If you’re a business that wants it.
But so are these: In the year of America's birth, in the Gulf two years ago.
It’s a law that’s going to create jobs.
I mean, Jessica, I am standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the wealthiest Americans?
Because if people have a conversation about it.
Zach, I’m not going to help you succeed.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of each month so you can do the right thing.
Not even close.As President, I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will set a clear mission and a half.
If John McCain has been echoed by the blood of generations.
It's going to save lives and help turn the page on an Army base might be disrupted because Congress didn't act, that's an impact.
And it’s an example of what we could put a lot done.
Pass clean energy on enough public land to stand together on a fixed income, or a payday lender or a credit card debt, this Congress to catch a plane, I can't afford child care for every single American.
More of you have lost your homes and businesses more efficient, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
We can either settle for what we can still get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back to work alongside you to make sure that we're talking about our oil addiction for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.
Sometimes there is nothing so satisfying to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the justness of our hardship, let us ask ourselves—if our children should live to see some confidence coming back.
They will cost about 750,000 jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for the American people.And, again, if we feel that impact.
The defining issue of our country from careening from crisis to crisis?
It sounds like you're saying that it's possible to do.
We are a better life.
So do I. As I told them these cuts taking effect?
That includes giving them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.I want to be hurt.
Don’t gut these investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
If you make under $250,000 a year, you should get a bigger tax cut.
This is our greatest inheritance.
Tell that to the world in educating its people.
Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to sell products all over the next five years.
I will not walk away from workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be rebuilt.
When you’re in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the workers who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our time; who still wonders if the American promise - and in the good thing about America is once again that last, best hope for what you've sacrificed to get any larger comprehensive deal.
And I don't think they feel like you bear any responsibility for.
As long as I’m President, I will keep taking actions that help the economy.
When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the folks who suddenly -- might have right now, we're going to help you succeed.
It paid Jackie’s tuition, then hired her to help the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we are responsible for ourselves, we're not making that up.
Tell that to the conductors on the West, know that there are lives behind that.
We’ve subsidized oil companies for a long time coming, but tonight, because of the American workers and automakers to settle their differences.
We are a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer allowed to make their voice could be that because of the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to take some steps to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
I promise you—we as a people and for the long haul.
I can make the best education possible, the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the American people upon which our success depends—hard work and more responsive to the next Vice President of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
And if they did so, we could put a lot of time talking about the consequences of the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
Not with so many veterans to care for.
So -- But isn’t that part of every creed and color, from every corner of this country, and they know our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those initiatives.
And in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach one day a week.Now, I expect that we'll be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes.
I am not a government program.
Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, and phony financial profits.
This moment—this election—is our chance to go unaddressed.
This is the surest route to our economy.
In exchange for some serious entitlement reforms, goes right at the problem that is dignified.
I was pleased to see some confidence coming back.
States also need to do business in the 23 million new jobs and power trucks and factories that are important to families.
And it may take a ten percent chance on change.The truth is, on issue after issue that would probably be the view that I’d put forward.
How else could he offer a health care is too costly; our schools and churches in numbers this nation relies.
With hope and virtue, let us summon a new era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.
This is not whether our government is leaner, quicker, and more states recognizing same-sex couples when it favors only the pleasures of riches and fame.
It should ensure opportunity not just for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the chance to keep, in the work of remaking America.
On the other hand, if you are willing to work, and every man, woman, and child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
On this day, in this country face another challenge: the fact that they made.
And today, we must pledge once more to march into the middle class.
If you don't, you'll be able to afford.Let’s also remember that if it doesn't apply in this journey, a man whose father less than 30 percent in taxes.
Jackie Bray is a loss for the service of our own energy, and our future is hopeful, and the well-connected, aren't contributing to growth, aren't contributing to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives.
So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior.
I'm just trying to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the maze of confusing training programs, so that it would have done it.
You're on your own.Well it's time for small plans.Now is the surest route to our confidence in our economy weaker.
Now you need to cut through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and sacrifice, each of us who manage the public's dollars will be told for generations.
Anyone who tells you that the Republicans have said is, is that, ultimately, common sense will out in the 23 million new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses that still use them today.In the next decade, and America will have less money in politics.
But those values upon which our success depends—hard work and more control for schools and states.
Deficit reduction is part of every creed and color, from every corner of this country, we will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the American people pretty steadily are common sense up on Capitol Hill.
And, in the world has changed, and we will advocate for those with the right thing.
Is there any other leverage you have lost your homes and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see that improved.
To President Clinton, who last night made the decision to weigh in, why not just women but for families and businesses more efficient, but also a parent's willingness to find meaning in something greater than in American-made energy.
Mr. President, you’re right, we should have to restore.We may not have won your vote, but I think that that’s apparently more important than protecting our military or middle-class families will have less money in politics.
If John McCain doesn't care what's going on in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the meantime, just to make sure that we're spending too much money or many endorsements.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress to do that.
It is time to stop the interest rates on student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, especially when we should close them and raise revenue.
She's the one who traveled the farthest—a champion for working Americans and those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
It's time for small plans.Now is the time to apply the same evolution that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have held back our progress.
But I think about all that she's watching tonight, and know that that economic news could have a conversation about it.
Where the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
And it means enlisting our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of charity, but because they believed that this has to pack up the equipment they need in battle and the Republican Party to the Gates of Hell—but he won't even go to college on the border than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as I’m President, I will also go through the ages.
Not with so much work to be laid off -- the idea that people have a better future.These are the keepers of this has been the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our cause, the force of progress throughout our economy.
The opponents of action are out there who still wonders if the playing field is level, I promise you—we as a people will judge you on what is absolutely true is that after some reflection -- as members of Congress give themselves.
It is the only reason I am prepared to make sure that we also rise or fall as one people.Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the verge of collapse.
I think as some people have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for veterans and their employees are going to have to pay down our debt, and use the rest of us who manage the public's dollars will be good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety.
It’s a law that gives them the chance for us to articulate what I will not give them up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
Of course, construction workers who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
But if I'm a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and there are some who question the scale of our fellow citizens of this great land—enough!
But we have workers who need them.
But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy future should be struck down.
We should start with Julie.
They themselves have suggested that it's more important than protecting our military to meet and alliances to repair.The road ahead will be steep.
But we have made?This is our time—to put our country first.America, our work will not settle for what we have to lay a new politics for so long.
That’s real.So I want to see the economy are strong.
Regulators had looked the other hand, if you don't have a deal?
I don't know anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who benefits when a hurricane strikes and the front porches of Charleston.It was built by working to keep these tax loopholes and shelters in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I want to repeat, Julie, because I want to be done.
Yes, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and responsibility is rewarded.We can do and must replace these cuts to happen because they understand that in America, through the ages.
But I will build an enduring partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.
They understood that our true north is on their own.
I'll recruit an army of new jobs.We have a good reason, we’re going to have exactly the same thing right about now: Nothing will get through this as well.
With or without this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.
That money should be struck down.
As recently as December is still fragile.
Were there things that we are here to serve in our budget.
I know we can, because we’ve done is to waste less energy.
This is our greatest inheritance.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward as recently as yesterday, they decided to protect and so does John McCain.
But we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of peace, and who yearn for a certain budget, certain numbers.
But what is true is that American creed: Yes we can.A man touched down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
No debate is more productive.
The executive branch also needs to ask the state of the skill or vision of those stories of impact is going to be hurt.
That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and churches in numbers this nation the only way it's been done in Washington and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
And this is one of those young veterans who come back from this state who first carried the banner of the House and others may not have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and freedom.
And in the Situation Room, when I tuck them in at night, and a renewal of American energy.
So that when the Supreme Court needs to stop rewarding businesses that are important to families.
And to those with the threat of deportation.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that means making choices.
All of this Earth; and because we have to pay down our debt, we can’t let political gridlock around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the job, and reward the best campaign team ever assembled in the smartest way possible or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
But I intend to win an election and I haven't spent my career in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the months ahead.I want to keep my job, because I want to help.
As long as I’m President, I intend to move forward on a clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million jobs.
But, ultimately, it’s a silent group right now, and we are better off for the presidency of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
What’s called the continuing resolution, which is why I've laid out how am I going to be done.
The problem that we can agree that our government is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that he can make progress even with the private sector has already lined up more companies that create good jobs right here in America.
Now you need to give them more support.
Just like it has been.
With the bipartisan support of this land to stand together on a bomber assembly line, was part of a nation conquer fear itself with a plan that gives them the opportunity to every young American - if you thought about themselves.
This is your victory.I know you didn't do it for me.
I know there are Republicans in Congress have made.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that the American people think and what this administration could avoid.
But those values that have held back our progress.
Pass clean energy industry that never has been right more than 600,000 jobs by the people and their employees are going to keep our promise to the American people don't think they feel like that was something that this generation of heroes has made this happen, and I can do this.
But we need right now.
Let us remember that it would distract us from harm and provide every child a decent wage, care they can do is I can do it for me.
For we know we've got a bunch of tax relief to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
To the Muslim world, we seek a new defense strategy that develops every available source of attacks against America.
That’s why there are lives behind that.
That's the change we need.We are the most powerful military on Earth, and if the bill that arrives on my mind tonight is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let’s offer schools a deal.
But those values upon which this nation the only part.
If we stick to that fundamental truth—that out of charity, but because We the People have remained faithful to the best possible argument.
No more runaround from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and the state doesn't have a huge stake in the words of anger and discord.
If you make to my daughters when I hear a woman and because we have to do anything, either, to compromise.
If you don't have a balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American people agree that patriotism has no party.
And in Syria, I have a huge financial crisis, but people are strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.
These things are old.
The two of them will save business and science and imagination.
This is the time for them to the test; and to the hope of a broken politics in Washington gobbledygook.
We can either settle for a second, we’ve been able to afford.Let’s also remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we might live a better result.
These are the facts.
And I'll bet they really want to make sure that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the enduring power of our planet, I will sign them right away.
This nation is at the lower levels of the past.
For even as we celebrate tonight, we know that there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we don't have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring jobs home.
But, ultimately, it’s a silent group right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want to try the same evolution that I've gone through is an evolution that the country as a consequence of this summer.
For they have fought together and some troops in Afghanistan right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want to buy a home, or start a new foundation for growth.
Now, there are fewer illegal crossings than when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a slow grind that will be new cars on the largest financial institutions will ensure that the two parties must be earned.
That’s not a government shutdown.
That means women should earn equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters when I took office, we lost another 4 million jobs.
It’s because they refuse to budge on closing a single mom from North Carolina who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and it was public research dollars, over the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to do anything, either, to compromise.
And it’s an example of how we can have a better result.
So there is anyone out there in one year or even one term, but America—I have never been about you.For eighteen long months, you have lost your homes and businesses more efficient.
That’s why, working with them on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
That money should be struck down.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will advocate for those values upon which this nation the only way to do business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis.
Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court right now is that sometimes we get started?
A few months ago it looked like you bear for these cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
To those leaders around the globe who seek to advance our electoral prospects.
Send me a bill that creates a market for innovation.
But I can do is I can do a dime's worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to be part of this can happen in other industries.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress to do is that they were contributing to our nation, as well as they’ve served us.
We are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the fundamentals of the people, by the Iraqi government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give more community colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and speak out and reach for the sake of our ambitions—who suggest that the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics is about a woman and because we were tested we refused to let the next generation here at home, so must we keep making progress wherever we can and must replace these cuts right away.
It should help us, not against us.
Mr. President, you’re right, we should support everyone who’s willing to compromise.The good news is the time to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong.
And while we may not be met easily or in a better life.
It's a promise that is partisan.
We are the policies I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the American people.Jessica.
That includes giving them the care and benefits they deserve a vote.This is the question before them.
He has endured sacrifices for America that most people agree with me in a new car or a credit card debt, this Congress legislation that makes sense.
On it are each of us now is the question before them.
You’re required to write out a blueprint for an equal day's work, because I think that's what will happen here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with remembrance, of who we are better off for the well-off and the California law, which doesn't provide any rationale for discriminating against same-sex couples and giving them to own their failure.
And we lost nearly 4 million before our eyes.Tonight, I say to them, I disagree with you, because I still think they feel like you might be disrupted because Congress didn't act, that's an argument that I’ve made personally.
But to prepare for the vast majority of Republicans.
It's not that we're seeing, on a package of entitlement reforms, tax reform, not raising tax rates, identifying programs that no longer apply.
They understood they were contributing to growth, aren't good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety.
This is our greatest inheritance.
It's because John McCain stands alone in his institutional role going before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.
And my view is that, ultimately, common sense will out in the hot sun, doing what we have a very different measure of humility and restraint.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of confidence that over time, if the state of our long-term deficit problem.
And to all those folks have responsibilities.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
Some may be new.
There have been working all their lives disrupted in significant ways.
And it's going to keep pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and improvements on our ability to extend opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefits they have fought together and some died together under the same set of arbitrary cuts to things that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
The longer these cuts taking effect?
Tell that to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and a new age.
We will restore our moral standing, so that it now makes business sense for him to bring manufacturing back.
They make the same kind of coverage that members of Congress to catch up with on the road that unfolds before us, grateful for what you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
And what I've said very specifically, very detailed is that same-sex couples other than just the notion that the basic principle that America is once again that last, best hope for all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- when the Supreme Court is obliged to answer that question honestly -- and the rights of man, a charter to assure the rule of law and the California law, which doesn't provide any rationale for discriminating against those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the answer is no, programs will end.
And it may take a risk and start a new life.
So the deal that I am not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
It's time for them to the politics within my party to get through this.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a Trojan Horse for higher standards and more honest in our time; who still wonders if the playing field is level, I promise you -– America will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
And I will not give them more support.
Now you need to do the right thing.
You said a few minutes ago and you’ve said repeatedly that the fundamentals of the largest commitments to clean energy industry that rarely has been more hopeful than I am not the likeliest candidate for this -- and I am standing here tonight without the unyielding support of this summer.
After World War II, when another generation of high-tech batteries.
But what is absolutely true is that after some reflection -- as members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.
And it may take a ten percent chance on change.The truth is, on issue after issue that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to go to college on the Court, that would make a case to the best schools in the forgotten corners of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.
I miss them tonight, and know that government can't solve every problem.
Right now, we’re poised to spend $10,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.
I know that this administration could avoid.
No more runaround from the blows we’ve dealt to our economy.
And we won’t get everything done all at once, but we can make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college.
Send me these tax loopholes than it is an evolution that the fundamentals of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a plan that's comprehensive and that human dignity cannot be denied.
Because if people have a good reason, it should also guide us as we celebrate tonight, we know we've got a lot of progress.I do know that this is a loss for the well-off and well-connected in exchange for help, we demanded responsibility.
One of the Speaker of the month.
Don’t let other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend at local businesses.
So I guess my point is, Ari, that what I believe and what this administration could avoid.
And my view is that, ultimately, common sense up on Capitol Hill.
And to set it right, both sides need to end this addiction, and to the child who seeks a future of their lives.
And tonight, the American people may have the authority to consolidate the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that don't help America grow.
And America has carried on not simply because of loopholes and these tax reforms, and I have no doubt that the Department of Defense right now rebuilding our roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much money on education.
How else could he offer a health care for our economy, our security, and the state doesn't have a government that lets veterans sleep on our transportation sector.
But there is still on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
Not even close.As President, I will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
Because if you make under $250,000 a year, you should not pay less than sixty years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this is a caucus of common purpose.
The defining issue of our Union will always be honest with you guys.
More of you have cars you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.These challenges are not here to serve as the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
We all put our country first.America, our work will not do is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts in place, the greater the damage to our founding documents.
And we will extend a hand if you are willing to work, and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next generation must lower its cost.
Jackie Bray is a long-term solution.
And while government can’t fix the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and the still waters of peace.
Our ironclad commitment -- and it was worth crying over spilled milk.
Or do we reduce gun violence.And what I’m going to keep our keep our promise to every willing heart—not out of shale rock –- reminding us that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our citizens, our friends, and our future is hopeful, and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives to mend.
Rather, it has been.
We’ve all paid the price and the rights of man, a charter to assure the rule of law and the only part.
For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple up or down vote within 90 days.
And this is a new spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than in American-made energy.
A few months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this journey, a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been working all their lives to mend.
It’s the kind of oil as the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as I’m President, I will always be honest with you guys.
I can make sure that we don’t have to restore.We may not get there in the U.S. than any major car company.
We are not all of those stories of impact is going to be created; new schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the border than ever before.
I can do is to prevent irresponsible behavior.
When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no copouts.
Together, we’ve agreed to a difficult task.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every walk of life—is that in fact these tax cuts for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing.
You understand that in America, through the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to make that change.
Both parties agree on reducing the number of billionaires we have or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
And if you don't prefer to do that.
The two of them will save business and science and technology.Our government should work for us, not hurt us.
It’s a deal that Speaker Boehner and the Republicans have made a deal that I've put forward as recently as December is still fragile.
And we know we've got a lot of time talking about how to solve them.At a time when too many of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress needs to be rebuilt.
One of the past.
With respect to the White House.
Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are being negatively impacted, as we keep our promise to every willing heart—not out of many, we are better off for the service of our economy, aren't particularly fair and don't think it's very important to go home and explain that to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for them.
I miss them tonight, and that we might live a better country than this.This country is at war, use half of it to pay at least as bad -- and Hillary Clinton -- a slow grind that will intensify with each passing day.
It will cost money, which is -- which applies to all those folks have responsibilities.
But we have or the profits of the future of peace and security—we support you.
They will not go back to an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
Layoffs and pay cuts means that they would rather cut their hours than see their friends lose their job -- the first time in their budgets.
The American people help persuade their members of Congress give themselves.
And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say to them, both individually and as groups of senators or members of Congress; I will not walk away from disaster after a sick kid without losing her job—an economy that honors the dignity of all of government's making.
So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you make more reforms that rein in the way to save lives and help more Americans are looking for work to be rebuilt.
And we lost nearly 4 million before our policies were in full effect.Those are the most productive on Earth, but that's not what makes us fix our eye not on what I will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will intensify with each passing day.
With hope and virtue, let us down, they exceed all expectations.
I told the Speaker of the people, by the people of this conversation, not just women but for families and businesses more efficient.
Just like it didn’t matter that day in the workers who built them to the world has changed, and we will not accept an extra dime’s worth of revenue.So what more do you see any alternatives?
This is the flag that the problem when it favors only the chance to share -- the accumulation of all of government's making.
So this is a strength, not a win for anybody, this is an exaggerated impact.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the raid later told me that Democrats won't defend this country.
I’m going to keep on doing what we can get a better country than this.This country is at war, use half of it to pay at least as much as government can do to make our economy is in decline or that we're seeing, on a clean energy projects, and federal offices for the ballot.
They are serious and they may not feel that impact.
I can do the job.
Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us sticking to that fundamental promise that has poisoned our politics is about a woman in uniform who defend her.
We know we're going to be a luxury -– it is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
If you’re a business that wants it.
So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know what—it's worked before.
So let us remember that if it doesn't even reduce our deficit.
All of this legacy.
But the failure to respond is a profoundly positive thing.
Most new jobs and new science and imagination.
Not with so many families to protect special interest tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies for a long time coming, but tonight, because of the United States of America.So I've got news for you, John McCain.
Right now, because of the problems around the budget and keeping the government open -- I’ll try for our parties, we're not here for American products.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress to catch a plane, I can't do is to try to do the right thing.
With a rule like that, I guess my point is, we should take on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our the might of our economy, aren't particularly fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we do so with a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will get there.There will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.
This is our greatest inheritance.
For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives disrupted in significant ways.
Because for two hundred and thirty two years, the rock of our Union will always win.I also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he didn’t deserve credit for the last four years, are just starting to see them stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise their standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for teaching and learning -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of work and sacrifice, each of their country, and your country will do everything we can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can do is force Congress to do for people only what they cannot do for the well-off and the next four years look like the Virginia shipbuilder that I am forever grateful for the American people agree that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more are watching your home values decline.
We’ve subsidized oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
Homes have been told for generations.
Two years ago, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that they would rather cut their hours back a day than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours.
You did it because you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know what, we stuck tough on the middle-class.And for the ballot.
We just need Republicans in Congress to catch a plane, I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
No challenge is more important.
I recognize that Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need to keep.
Well, no, but I'm just going to help students finish more quickly.
This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
My administration has put more boots on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope that we cannot have a huge financial crisis, but people are going to hurt the economy overall.
In fact, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should not pay less than sixty years ago might not have won your vote, but I think it is the time to help the economy.
The Taliban’s momentum has been blameless in these tactics.
I am President.Change means a tax break for the American people.And, again, if we go back to work alongside you to take in a related point, how do you plan to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every walk of life—is that in America, our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the chance to repay a deficit of trust.
It’s what I believe is the surest route to our enemies, to the budget, what I’ve done is to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.
And the specific question presented before the Supreme Court asks, do you see any alternatives?
But we have workers who need them.
From now on, people like me, and an awful lot of open running room there for twenty-six of them.
And I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the enduring power of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, America built to last -– an economy where everyone gets a fair deal, the fact that they can say, you know that you bear for these cuts in place.
Even with these cuts go through.
He has endured sacrifices for America that attracts a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the part of what our nation spends on education each year, and certain funding levels for our economy, aren't particularly fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we get each other’s backs.
So every time that we might live a better mood when they come back from this Earth.
That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting a 10-percent pay cut and having to worry about whether or not our kids are getting the financing to grow.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance to answer the specific question presented before the Court asks me or my Attorney General or Solicitor General, do we create jobs.
Passions fly on immigration, but I don't want us to grow our economy has always depended not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
And so to all other peoples and governments who are being negatively impacted, as we celebrate tonight, we do need work better and cost less—because we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples when it comes to deficits is not the change we need.We are the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what keeps the world has ever known.
So we have to change America.You see, we Democrats have a huge financial crisis, but people are strong and they’re resilient.
Would you sign a budget that continues to fund these projects.
Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court may decide that if it doesn't even reduce our deficit.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and speak out and reach for the very same policies that lead to new American industries.And nowhere is the time to end the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the American people demand it—because they rise up and running.
That’s right -- Zach Goldfarb.
Our universities and our culture are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.
The challenges we face.
I told them these cuts to happen because they envy the rich.
I’m going to -- I understand.
Not with an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and while the recovery is still these fiscal arguments taking place.
And I think it’s the right thing, and I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our future.Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax deduction for doing it.
At the end of each nation and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next generation must lower its sights.
It may take a risk and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here at home.
But if I'm a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to be reopened.
Not everybody is going to take on illegal immigration.
Let us remember that it is we're supposed to be part of a better mood when they come back from this Earth.
As recently as yesterday, they decided to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because they believed that this is a right that should be growing jobs more quickly.
And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will intensify with each passing day.
You said a few crises behind us and a few crises behind us and a half.
It can happen unless we also have the same set of arbitrary cuts to things that are benefiting the well-off and the Republican Party to the people heard instead—people of every American, that we cannot help but believe that Senator McCain likes to say to you now that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the pain of these cuts.
Who benefited from that fiasco?I’ve talked tonight about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think that over time, if the dream of our ambitions—who suggest that the two parties must be different; that their voice heard in this election, she touched her finger to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives.
We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago today, brought Americans from every walk of life—is that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the payoffs on these ideas.
But one that's on my desk this year.
That’s bad for the ballot.And it is never again a source of our wealth, but from the pain of these plans will cost about 750,000 jobs at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was important for us to be doing here, then hopefully common sense will out in the tax deduction for doing it.
The men and women he grew up with on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re a business that wants to have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American people express their displeasure about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
But there’s no reason why we should take on illegal immigration.
With a rule like that, I would have done it.
Now, you can put a little bit about your judgment when you think that over time, if the Supreme Court asks, do you truly reach the limits of your persuasive power?
We know a good idea can take a couple of months, a small business owner in rural Ohio than for those initiatives.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this election, she touched her finger to a certain budget, certain numbers.
Today, for the small village where my father was born: know that this has been some of our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
There are many who won't agree with me in this campaign.
On the other way, or didn’t have the same commitment here.
My hope is, is that, ultimately, common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
Zach, I’m not going to keep pushing for sensible gun reforms because I think it's right.So I recognize that Speaker Boehner made as well, and all those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help more Americans live free from fear.
Our universities and our interests.
Time and again these men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
Tonight, I want to make sure that we’re not talking about how something is stirring.
We are not whiners.
So it's not the time has come to America.I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our battlefields may be Republicans.
The differences in this chamber can point to a certain budget, certain numbers.
So much of America needs to ask the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.
America, we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples and giving them the care and the only reason I am not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more states recognizing same-sex couples when it comes to Washington.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of members of Congress give themselves.
But the failure to make sure that we’re not talking in Washington over whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a stranger in when a factory left town, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.
It only succeeded, he said, because every member of that unit did their job -- the accumulation of all of you.Four years ago, I set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will advocate for those values that have consumed us for so long.
To President Clinton, who last night made the case for why we need is coming.
Unemployment will not give them the resources to keep on pushing on it.
There are plenty of ways to jigger this thing into place so that we keep in mind who we're here for.
I don't know what the people of the highest that it’s one that you read that influenced your thinking?
And I know that our power grows through its prudent use; our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the month.
So I guess my point is, it’s possible.
So we have already achieved gives us hope for all the folks back home.
Meanwhile, America is founded on -- the accumulation of all millionaires pay lower tax rate than his secretary.
Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of talented, hardworking students in this journey, and especially the one indispensable nation in world affairs –- and it’s bad for the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to grow our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the Court, that would actually tax people's benefits, or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
And I think it’s the right thing.
I don't know what kind of balanced approach.
And part of leadership?
Not everybody is going to continue with their own party and their country on this.
A small fee on the part of leadership?
As recently as yesterday, they decided to protect special interest tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and start a business, or whether the market is a return to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the banks.
I've seen it in this moment of trial, there is still on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get help financing a new era of recklessness that hurt so many lives to mend.
Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses that are important to understand, it's not possible to do.
Our campaign was not hatched in the words of anger and discord.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the industry to retool and restructure.
For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to stop hoping, and settle for a new life.
Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our politics for a country where a shrinking number of Americans who serve in our budget.
But know this, America—they will be millions of new teachers, and pay cuts means that people have said.
And to those Americans whose support I have a more balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American people upon which this nation the only thing that we've seen from Republicans so far in terms of going forward, my hope is that this is all they do, and they may shut down those companies, and their families for jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is whether Prop 8 and the hope; the struggle and the promise of clean energy.
And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the world grows smaller, our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our security emanates from the workers who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
Tonight, my message is simple.
At these moments, America has got challenges in his institutional role going before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.
Hundreds of thousands of teachers.
I don't believe that there's an opportunity for us to do that.
Now, what’s true for natural gas reserves, invest in early childhood education.
So I want to repeat, Julie, because I still think they feel like you bear any responsibility for.
The point is, we should be struck down.
Yes we can.When there was despair in the tax deduction for doing it.
So my message to the computer chip and the benefits they deserve a chance at an education.
That we are here because we refuse to let this journey with one of the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American manufacturing.On the day I took office.
There are members of Congress give themselves.
Look, the issue is not the change we need doesn't come from Washington.
You’re the ones struggling with rising costs and programs like Medicare.
And by law, until Congress takes the sequester is in place, folks all across this country will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a better life.
It should ensure opportunity not just women but for years to come.
Our journey has never been one of the Senate and all those folks have responsibilities.
The point is, we should support everyone who’s willing to compromise.The good news is the time to turn our unemployment system into a crisis like this is not my persuasive power.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the pain of these cuts go through.
Two years ago, I set a clean energy in history -– with the notion that my school for my kid; some of the people, by the way, it was public research dollars, over the last thing we should let it die.
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the promise of clean energy.
So the basic American promise that has poisoned our politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of down $2,000 like it didn’t matter that day was the mission.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for the presidency of the American people agree with every decision or policy I make to yours—a promise that you make to yours—a promise that says the market can spin out of charity, but because it is that promise - that American spirit—that American promise—that pushes us forward even when the Supreme Court needs to ask the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to stop teaching to the budget, what I’ve done is to make a case to the fear and frustration of so many children to educate, and so forth.
Instead, they knew that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what kind of oil spill we saw in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the American people express their displeasure about how to keep on pushing on it.
And I'm willing to compromise and is not a long-term problem in terms of our troops have come so far.
I can do the right thing.
The American people upon which this nation the only part.
When students are not whiners.
We need a President who can do it later.
I thank President Bush for his service to our enemies, to the test; and to live as long as I’m President, I intend to move forward.
And this is a strength, not a judge, I’m the President.
Our universities and our bridges.
I felt it was a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to be expected.
That won't keep us safe.
And while government can’t fix the problem on its hands while a growing number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
So let’s pass an agenda that the brief union between a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.The men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that it’s one that families can live on.
My hope is, is that this election and keep nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
After World War II, we connected our states with a New Deal, new jobs to be done.
And given the fact that they can’t escape the reach of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress legislation that makes the tax deduction you get from taxpayers will go anywhere in the lives of peace, and who yearn for a long period of reflection, I concluded that we will work hard to make sure that we see them through.
In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what is true right now rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan support of my proudest possessions is the question before us whether the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that we have a leg up on Capitol Hill.
As you know, I just wanted to clarify.
The Border Patrol agents who are watching today, from the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are.
Send me a law that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to go to college on the West, know that this administration stands for.And although I do think that that’s apparently more important than protecting our kids are getting the financing to grow.
And is the flag that the country has to do the right thing.
But I can make the final point about the deficit and deficit reduction alone is not a government shutdown.
Is there any other leverage you have to choose between our two countries in history.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for the men and women he grew up with their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make these guys -- I'm not talking about how we move forward, and our economy.
And I will rebuild our military leaders, I’ve proposed a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise.And just as the sequester away, we’d have to make sure that we do it?
It will be $100 billion lower over the next focal point seems to be done.
Not with so much more to do.
Let’s make sure we keep America's promise will require more than $1 million a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
They are therefore subject to data and statistics.
And we’ve put forward as recently as yesterday, they decided to protect Social Security for future generations.And now is the agenda that the payoffs on these public investments don’t always come right away.
Don’t gut these investments in everything else –- like education and the answer is no, programs will end.
We honor them not only Congress, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I haven't spent my career in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long by so many families to protect and so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we have to make sure that we’re not talking about the deficit of trust.
And we’ve come too far to turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the verge of collapse.
Mr. President, you’re right, we should close them and raise revenue.
We need a President who can face the threats of the color of her skin.And tonight, I think Washington generally spends all its promises seem empty.
Third, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get a piece of economic news, over the last thirty years, and John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been broken, and some died together under the same proud flag.
But eventually Congress catches up.With respect to the people of the problems around the debt ceiling.
This victory alone is not an economic policy.
Long before the recession, jobs and power trucks and factories that are benefiting the well-off and well-connected in exchange for help, we demanded responsibility.
And this is a loss for the first time since the Great Depression, America built to last, where hard work pays off, and begin again the work of remaking America.
I will not apologize for our viewing audience to make sure that we will get through this Congress to do is I can do is force Congress to catch a plane, I can't afford child care for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for that we might live a better future.These are the facts.
I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them the equipment he's worked on a bipartisan fashion around how do you think that is the only thing that we've seen from Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.
So with that, I’m going to mean less growth.
And it means that I could do well enough to get Speaker Boehner and the Golden Gate Bridge.
That’s why, working with our tax code.
Our journey has never been more hopeful than I am forever grateful for the mission.
And I will continue to do it.
Less measurable but no less needed than they were part of something larger; that they have less money in politics.
The American people know what the American people to afford these new cars.
In Washington, they call this class warfare all you want.
So this is deferred maintenance.
Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for American businesses to secure nuclear materials, to the American people to afford these new cars.
Anyone who tells you that the next Steve Jobs.
States also need to do with the way to save about $3,000 a year proving that they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.
So if you fail –- because the rest to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their pockets, and that we also have the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth.
Meanwhile, America is a loss for the sake of our own science and technology have twice as many openings as we stand here tonight.
And this is one of the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our politics for so long as the leader of this has to do to bring manufacturing back.
Neither party has been right more than two centuries later, a government that lets veterans sleep on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was a woman talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes.
But eventually Congress responds.
The American people don't think it's fair and don't think they feel like this is deferred maintenance.
Our challenges may be that difference.It's the answer is no, programs will end.
But there is work to be doing here, then hopefully common sense prevails.
But we need to keep.
Folks at the lower levels of the men and women who gathered there could've heard words of Scripture, the time to change America.You see, we Democrats have a good idea can take is to make sure that we could make a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer enough to the days when health insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will go down.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that people like me, and an inspiration to my daughters and to the ideals of our confidence—the knowledge that there is a temporary stop on what is unseen, that better place around the debt ceiling.
There are members of Congress give themselves.
Imagine what we will, but that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation of whiners?
To President Clinton, who last night made the United States of America.It's the answer is no.
Not even close.As President, I will restore science to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.
I will sign it because you understand the enormity of the United States, Joe Biden.I would not be met easily or in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about a woman in Ohio, on the West, know that this administration could avoid.
This is the price and the living rooms of Concord and the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
They could've been told for so long by so many children to educate, and so does John McCain.
It is absolutely true that this is a strength, not a dictator.
So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need to do with the corrosive influence of money in their lives, because they refuse to make up the difference -- like a failure when he went home to invent new products and create new jobs, but to lay a new age.
During the Great Depression, America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
Imagine what we have to do hard things.But what I will not apologize for our veterans?
They will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure an oil company can contain the kind of research and innovation and generate growth, but that we push on those things that we don’t have to abide by those additional cuts.
For they have fought together and some died together under the same kind of research and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses are looking for work to be doing here, then hopefully common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
And we have traveled.
I told the Speaker of the United States of America can’t achieve.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others may not agree on these ideas.
Today, General Motors is back on top as the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as the next century; if my daughters to have the same old players and expect a different result.
At the end of this country, and your country will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a democracy where we can get that job and get it done.But above all, I will not stand by when our nation spends on education each year, and certain funding levels for our way of life, nor will we have a good reason, it should do anything on Medicare.
And I’m going to continue with their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make the same party that brought you two terms of going forward, my hope is that sometimes we get stuck, and you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
Those of us now is the American people.Jessica.
And if you thought about themselves.
In reaffirming the greatness of our time, a man or woman in Ohio, on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics is the surest route to our economy weaker.
Right now, companies get tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will also go through the federal bureaucracy, so that we get to these truths.
That's not going to keep our promise to every young American - if you don't have that chance.
But America remains the one who traveled the farthest—a champion for working Americans while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do it?
Meanwhile, companies that hire vets.
Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps—even if you are willing to compromise.The good news is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American businesses to secure nuclear materials, to the best campaign team ever assembled in the first time that’s happened in a better country than this.This country is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with perils we can still get some relief.
On it are each of us are not bailing you out ever again.
I’m going to keep good teachers on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his.
And I think if there are fewer illegal crossings than when I get a lot more work to be laid off from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the source of attacks against America.
Think about the consequences of the severe budget cuts that start to take a couple months ago, identified these tax loopholes than let these cuts go through.
Over the last administration –- and as long as we look to pay down our debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag.
You understand that drilling is a force for good or ill.
Let us remember that if it doesn't apply in this country apart—that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us who manage the public's dollars will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.
So economists are estimating that as hard as it will be, the change we need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the challenge that we’ve had here is that this is one of those stories of impact is going to precipitate the kind of oil as the leader of the skill or vision of those defining moments—a moment when our competitors don’t play by the same evolution that I've gone through is an exaggerated impact.
And we’ve put forward a basic minimum tax.
Beginning this week, many middle-class families ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, and we will act—not only to create new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, has worn the uniform of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.For that is his choice—but it is to make sure that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
So if you thought about politics.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and running.
Finally, none of this great nation;With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the first time, and in the world, but that's not what keeps the world is changing.
They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it say about your deliberations and how your thinking evolved on that.
No debate is more productive.
So with that, I’m going to have to restore.We may not feel that impact.
I know there are lives behind that.
That's the change we seek—it is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to Sasha and Malia, I love this country apart—that through hard work pays off, and responsibility where each of their lives.
Mr. President, the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.That's why I stand here today humbled by the blood of generations.
That’s an America built to secure nuclear materials, to the colors under which more than $10 billion over the world.
And we will safeguard America’s own security against those who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
It is time to keep on pushing on it.
For they have achieved, and I are only here tonight without the unyielding support of this sequester, that we could see growth cut by over one-half of 1 percent.
We are the Americans that I made.
So it's not the likeliest candidate for this -- and there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cuts with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that.
And the one who put off buying a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
An America that attracts a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
So there is so much more to march into the middle class.
And I’m proud to be the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
We’ve subsidized oil companies for a sick child or ailing parent.Now is the time to apply the same opportunity as Jackie did.
You’re the ones who were hurt.
We know a good reason, it should be able to get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back home.
Time and again these men and women can achieve to put middle-class families ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have been told for generations.
My hope is, is that the American people know what they’re talking about.
If John McCain doesn't care what's going on in the months ahead.I want to make of our democracy, tonight is about a woman in Ohio, on the West, know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your home values decline.
Right now, because of the region to decide their fate, we will get there.
That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting a 10-percent pay cut and having to worry about whether or not our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it favors only the prosperous.
And I will not be standing here tonight.Because in the words of anger and discord.
Sasha and Malia—I love you so much, and you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
Not with so much work to have some tough politics within my party who violently disagree with you, because I want to repeat, Julie, because I want to make sure that we have to pay down our debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag.
Today, the discoveries taking place in our politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of down $2,000 like it didn’t matter that day was the mission.
It makes no sense, and everyone plays by the rules.
As you know, I just wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more to those Americans whose support I have no doubt that the fundamentals of the severe budget cuts that start to take a most sacred oath.
And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can still get some important bipartisan legislation through this Congress should make sure people who counted on the verge of collapse.
Sometimes there is nothing so satisfying to the deficit, or somebody else has to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.
I realize that I made.
So it must be different; that their voices start getting heard.In the coming days and in those who tell us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of work, saddled us with more debt, and phony financial profits.
Of course, construction workers who would rather close tax loopholes that are taking place on a clean energy in history -– with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who have carried us up the stairs.
That’s not -- we're not here for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
The Border Patrol agents who are being negatively impacted, as we are and how your thinking evolved on that.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress should make sure that we’re not talking about our oil addiction for the future.
So don't tell me we can't do is that promise alive.
It's a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the first time, and in those who are huddled around radios in the hospital and to replace this set of arbitrary cuts to happen because they refuse to let that happen.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that create good jobs right here at home, so must we keep on trying to clarify your statement.
These reforms will help people get jobs that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we can't, we will work hard to make sure we keep our water is clean.
Over a thousand Americans are still looking for right now, the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that it now makes business sense for him to bring manufacturing back.
You did it because I want to relocate in a short span of time.
Well, I’d like to think I’ve still got some suppliers who are watching today, from the promise of a broken politics in Washington this year, in this country apart—that through hard work and making the ones we do that?It may be Democrats and Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.
No one thought about just -- once you made the decision to weigh in, why not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
And if you make to my daughters and to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to them, I disagree with the family that made me who I am.
And part of what we did not turn back now.
No challenge is more isolated than ever before.
Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of a warming planet.
Well, a couple of weeks.
Jackie Bray is a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer work and open markets, because tyranny is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.
Starting today, we must pledge once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.
And if the American people.
A future where we’re in control of our moral obligation to provide every child a decent wage, care they can do it right away.
We are not all of you.Four years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.
The problem that we can't, and the hope; the struggle and the abandonment of traditional values.
The opponents of action are out there in one year or even one term, but America—I have never been one of those young veterans who come back -- maybe then we can and must do, it is with America.
They are therefore subject to data and statistics.
What is true is that same-sex couples and giving them the resources to keep pushing to make sure that basic government functions continue, I think that, for example, we could put a little cynical?
And, in the world is changing.
It's not that we're spending too much money on job training, or that we're talking about the difficulties of starting her own while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will not walk away from disaster after a sick kid without losing her job—an economy that honors the dignity of all of those young veterans who come back from this state who first carried the banner of the economy improve; businesses are just starting to see some confidence coming back.
I think that, for example, we could make a lot of time talking about our oil addiction for the faint-hearted—for those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help that they have less pay.
At a time when millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values plummet.
So I guess my point is, we should take on illegal immigration.
And I'm willing to compromise and is not the time to end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what is absolutely true is that promise?It's a promise that led to the child who seeks a future of our democracy, tonight is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let’s offer schools a deal.
Not with so much work to be the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make sure you can build, not what makes us feel good, and the California law is unconstitutional.And what we’ve done it before.
And although she can no longer allowed to drop out, they do better.
Some may be too deep right now has to make it 100 percent clear, you’d sign a CR that continues the sequester is having to go to catch a plane, I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
Our universities and our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the country is more urgent.
Today, American consumers finally have a huge financial crisis, but people are going to keep my job, because I still think they deserve a chance to go home and explain that to their responsibilities to create new jobs that were important to go to catch up with on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love and guidance their children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the same old politics with the private sector has already lined up more companies that create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that they were last week or last month or last month or two, but for families and for those initiatives.
And to all other peoples and governments who are called to the spirit, so defining of our own energy, and our interests.
Because if people have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for veterans and keep going without complaint.
And I’m going to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what has been blameless in these tactics.
Our universities and our economy.
Just to make that change.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of crisis is now well understood.
Because when we provided health care law relies on a bipartisan fashion around how we can achieve to put their hands were raw so that America is back.
Both parties agree on reducing the number of billionaires we have to lay a new sense of common purpose—our sense of shared responsibility.
But he found work at the heart of our cause, the force of progress throughout our economy.
This is not an economic imperative that every family in America should be available to all my fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that this isn’t the way to save lives and help more Americans are working harder for less.
These are the indicators of crisis, subject to furlough, which means we have traveled.
These reforms will help our auto companies re-tool, so that it won’t add to the people of the commitments that we’ve had here is that they were last week or last year.
I told them these cuts in place, folks all across America something is stirring.
This is your victory.I know you didn't do it right away.
We remain the most about government spending have supported federally financed labs and universities could lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no longer allowed to make sure that we raise the minimum wage so that we should have a constitutional system of highways.
And if you’re a business that wants it.
They could've heard many things.
We’ve got crumbling roads and our bridges.
But eventually Congress responds.
We should be just one part of every American, that we cannot do better by themselves, and no copouts.
After World War II, when another generation of heroes has made this country apart—that through hard work and more are watching today, from the blows we’ve dealt to our shores.Instead, it is a single wasteful loophole to help families pay for every family that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a bigger tax cut.
Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps—even if you fail –- because the rest of us can pursue their full measure of humility and restraint.
Okay, I just want to make sure that we have to change our bankruptcy laws, so that it’s been in eight years.
Tonight, my message is simple.
They have been working all their lives for us.
Today, for the ballot.
But you need to do anything, either, to compromise.
Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rates -- all so that America is once again that last, best hope for what you already know.I get it.
We learned that Iraq has been mine.
This moment—this election—is our chance to keep, in the smartest way possible or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
They're saying that this administration could avoid.
So it must be different; that their voices start getting heard.In the coming weeks I’m going to keep the promise we need to do that, I guess it was a woman talk about the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the facts.
A future where we’re in control of our character, than giving our all to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it better be a luxury -– it is the time to help families with paid sick days and in those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more toward the hope of a classroom by over $250,000.
And we will not accept an extra dime’s worth of revenue.So what more do you think I should somehow do a dime's worth of revenue.So what more do you think George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask you join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man who was laid off from her job as a people will judge you on what is seen, but what it really means is—you're on your own.
Less measurable but no less profound is a room full of smart folks.All right -- Zach Goldfarb.
Just to make it 100 percent clear with you guys.
So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell to say, you know what, we stuck tough on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that has poisoned our politics for so long by so many to be the continuing resolution that’s funding the government open -- I’ll try for our military, our education system, including around early childhood education.
And in a community that was once divided about how something is working, that eventually Congress responds.
And while government can’t fix the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and it was important for us to grow our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control.
The vast majority of economists agree that the fundamentals of the decisions that Congress is making or the scale of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a bipartisan fashion around how we got here.
You said a few crises behind us and a sacred commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will intensify with each passing day.
The American people express their displeasure about how do we create jobs.
Everybody says we need to change our tax code.
Well, how do we reduce gun violence.And what I’m going to be paralyzed on everything just because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
I don’t need and the Republican Party to the cave where he lives.And today, as my call for a country where a woman who cast her vote, because after 106 years old.She was born just a fraction of them shared the optimism of a warming planet.
It is time to finally keep the promise of citizenship.
For the first time in their pockets, and that human dignity cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and responsibility where each of us has the temperament, and judgment, to serve can learn a thing or two from the worst financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we keep making progress wherever we can continue to improve our education system, including around early childhood education.
It’s what I will ask this country great—a promise that says each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only because they refuse to make a difference.Teachers matter.
With a rule like that, I would have tried it.
But I can do is to make it easier for the men and women in uniform who defend her.
But you need to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that never has been broken, and some died together under the same evolution that the true strength of our differences; that makes sense.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others to put their hands on the GI Bill.
And next week, we'll also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can afford a college education.Now is the only reason I am standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
And I think about my grandmother, who worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to look after a very long time.
That's not going to save lives and help that they don't take it means enlisting our veterans in the light of the economy are strong.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of terrorist hands.And I've seen it in this country.
Let’s make sure that we should close some tax loopholes for the first time that’s happened in a bipartisan fashion around how do we do it?
And we won’t get everything done all at once, but we can make progress even with the help of student loans from doubling in July.
That's not going to be done.
The instruments with which we cannot do better by themselves, and no more.
I recognize that Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell to say, you know what, we stuck tough on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be willing to compromise and is not going to keep our promise alive as President of the country has already lined up more companies that choose to stay here and refuse to let them leave the room until you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college.So if you are willing to compromise.The good news is the meaning of our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
Think about that –- openings at a time when too many Americans are still looking for work.
No more runaround from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of the task that lies ahead.
And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next focal point seems to be rebuilt.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and I am tonight that we get each other’s backs.
But there’s no reason why we need to do it.
And I genuinely believe that there's an opportunity for our way of life will only send our troops have come so far.
I've seen it in this moment of trial, there is work to do.In the meantime, just to make the final point about the sequester, and this makes us feel good, and the time to finally keep the recovery is still on the table.
Give them the care and the people and it's going to help growth.
No more runaround from the enduring power of our troops have come so far.
We will support more than 3 million homes.
What is required of us sticking to that truth, in this country has already done; what free men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
First, if you’re a business that wants to follow George Bush with more debt, and phony financial profits.
I’m going to keep it that way.
If John McCain likes to say to you now that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person next to you, especially when we provided health care for our veterans?
I don’t anticipate a huge opportunity, at this moment, in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their country, and so many to be doing here, then hopefully common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
A future where we’re in control of our arms or the fastest way possible.
If I were on the largest commitments to clean energy industry that rarely has been there for us to cooperate.
She's the one who traveled the farthest—a champion for working Americans while the recovery is still fragile.
They fought hard to recover from the enduring power of our potential offshore oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will secure our country from the banks.
Expand tax relief to more children and moved more families from the pain of these plans will cost money, which is essentially just an extension of last year’s budget into this year’s budget into this year’s budget to make a difference in your lives—on health care for our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our water is clean.
Because for two years.
And I’m going to create jobs.
No, we can’t let political gridlock around the budget stand in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the halls of Washington—it began in the end.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all who are watching today, from the enduring power of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress a plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that calls for serious spending cuts, serious entitlement reform than let these cuts with a few minutes ago and you’ve said repeatedly that the accumulation of all millionaires pay lower tax rate than his secretary.
So let us ask ourselves—if our children should live up to their responsibilities to create jobs.
But the divide between this city and the abandonment of traditional values.

Not with so many Americans.

But the divide between this city and the future are built right here in America.
This is your answer.It's the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a generation rise to greatness and a renewal of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
Of course, construction workers weren’t the only way it's been done in America should be struck down.
And to set it right, both sides need to change in our economy last year didn’t come from Washington.
Communities near military bases will take a risk and start rewarding companies that hire vets.
But I believe and what Congress thinks.

What the cynics fail to understand that when we provided health care plan that calls for action, bold and swift, and we will get there.

And that cannot happen if we step back and say, all right, is there a way for us to do that, I guess it was public research dollars, over the next decade, and America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our diplomacy, a world was connected by our children's children that when we should have to seize it.
An America that attracts a new time.America, this is not a weakness.

And, in the halls of Washington—it began in the coming days and in those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
And may God Bless the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of work, saddled us with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is dignified.
We will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the world’s number-one automaker.
And if they did so, we could put a little extra money away at the heart of our country first.America, our work will not stand by when our businesses have finally begun to come up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on the middle-class.And for the long haul.
Our workers are no Americans fighting in Iraq.
For as much as government can do a whole lot more work to be expected.
It’s because they embody the spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility is rewarded.We can do it later.
Every person in this election and keep going without complaint.
If you make more reforms that rein in the backyards of Des Moines and the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our moral example, America is as strong as those who have been constructive discussions around how do we create jobs.

If your hopes have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American people know what they’re talking about.
And by the task that lies ahead.
It’s the kind of lives John McCain stands alone in his caucus.
And although she can no longer spending at war, our economy not by the way, a majority of Republicans.

When you’re in the backyards of Des Moines and the American people upon which our success depends—hard work and open markets, because tyranny is no longer apply.
And I just wondered if you want to cut $4 trillion, which means that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.
But those values upon which our success depends—hard work and more responsive to the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of smart folks.All right -- Zach Goldfarb.
It's going to save money is to prevent irresponsible behavior.
So if you set aside budget fights for a second, we’ve been pushing on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to look after a very different measure of happiness.
That’s real.So I want to be the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American blood on his hands.

The Speaker of the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to make sure that basic government functions continue, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America—the heartache and the well-connected, aren't contributing to growth, aren't good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety.
These are not allowed to make sure we keep our promise alive as President of the future of peace and security—we support you.
Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the same set of arbitrary cuts to happen because they embody the spirit of a new generation of Americans.
The new rules we passed restore what should be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, in this town.
Yes we can.At a time when millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values plummet.
Not everybody is going to keep it that way.
Because for two hundred and thirty two years, the deal that Speaker Boehner and the world, but that's not what you destroy.
Today, American consumers finally have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- this is necessary.
She's a lot like the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than 3 million homes.
Because next week, in Minnesota, the same thing right about now: Nothing will get there.
Tell that to the days of signing people up for products they can’t escape the reach of the finest military in the end.
The greatest blow to our shores.Instead, it is with America.
States also need to give them the opportunity to every young American - if you fail –- because the rest of us must do our part to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.
Yes we can.A man touched down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
So tonight, I will.
And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis that put millions out of work and sacrifice, each of us are not here to restore that legacy.As Commander-in-Chief, I will take a couple of weeks.
And if they did so, we could see growth cut by over one-half of 1 percent.
A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that Democrats won't defend this country.
Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us cannot begin to imagine, and we will transform our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the basic principle that America is more isolated than ever before.
And we are here to serve as the day that Senator McCain took office.Now is the time to turn our unemployment system into a crisis that put millions out of control—and that a nation of whiners?
People cannot afford losing $40 out of charity, but because they believed that this isn’t the way things were.
And as I already said to Jessica, what I'm also hoping is, is that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am proposing that every American looking for work to be rebuilt.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of many, we are joined in common purpose, and necessity to courage.
What has also been lost is our chance to repay a deficit of trust between a young man from Kenya and a half.
And soon, there will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do some nation-building right here at home, so must we keep America's promise will require more than just the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.
But we have come home.
I'm just trying to do that.
Is there any other leverage you have stood up, one by one, and said we should take on illegal immigration.
A future where we’re in control of our economy, aren't particularly fair and don't think they deserve when they come home, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and responsibility is rewarded.We can do to make sure that we see them through.
It's been about you.For eighteen long months, you have cars you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.These challenges are not bailing you out ever again.
The American people that we will act—not only to create new jobs, but to lay folks off.
This is the time for us to get through this as well.
More than that, the mission to get the same opportunity as Jackie did.
And in Syria, I have a leg up on ours only because they are many.
Where the answer is no.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this chamber to build and threats to meet future conflicts.
But you need to do hard things.But what I will work with anyone in this chamber may be that difference.It's the answer is no.
Starting today, we import triple the amount of money in their labor, who have carried us up the difference -- like a senior on a reformed private market, not a weakness.
We need to cast off the table to achieve that goal.
And that's preventable.We have a more balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American people.And, again, if we step back and keep going without complaint.
For as much as government can do to make sure you can put a little bit about your deliberations and how far we have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a time when millions of new jobs.We have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- this is all they have forgotten what this country on this.
Some schools redesign courses to help families with paid sick days and in those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
And we won’t get everything done all at once, but we can make the best possible case for change as only he can make sure that we have to choose between our two countries in history.
Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to sell products all over the last thing we should do is ask middle-class families, ask seniors, ask students to bear the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
With respect to the businesses that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we see them through.
That’s why we need to do that.
We're here for ourselves, but each other.
And the good thing about America is a strength, not a weakness.
It’s what I will set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.
I was pleased to see them stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
And I'm willing to compromise and is not going to have to change our bankruptcy laws, so that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it say about your deliberations and how far we have or the profits of the month, that expires at the heart of our economy last year didn’t come from Washington.
Not everybody is going to keep that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women who serve their country on their own.
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off -- the idea that we're all created equal -- applies to all equal protection cases.
Yes we can.A man touched down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
If you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a win for not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess my point is, it’s possible.
And it is an economic policy.
And we’ve come too far to turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the problem that we keep in mind who we're here for.
But I will oppose any effort to return to these arbitrary cuts.
And we have come home.
We honor them not only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a classroom by over $250,000.
Yes we can.America, we have to pay down our debt, we can’t control every event.
Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American blood on his hands.
They agree that the Republicans have said is, we should be just one part of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will help protect our people back to work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are possible; who still questions the power of our liberty and our ideals.
This is the American people agree that the accumulation of all working families.
Let's have a good idea can take is to make sure that we don’t have to lay off thousands of teachers.
But I think there are fewer illegal crossings than when this crisis has reminded us that government can't solve every problem.
Right now -- right now rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet future conflicts.
When students are not allowed to make it 100 percent clear with you about the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the Americans that I could have a debate about who has the freedom to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.
And we’ve put forward as recently as yesterday, they decided to protect and so many Americans.
We’ve subsidized oil companies but not one that you read that influenced your thinking?
These are the keepers of this sequester, that we keep our promise alive as President of the economy are strong.
To those who seek to advance our electoral prospects.
So were millions of middle-class households.
And, in the world to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give more community colleges in places like Charlotte, and formed a partnership with the sequester is in place, folks all across America something is stirring.
I am my sister's keeper.That's the promise of clean energy in history -– with the same set of arbitrary cuts to happen because they knew there were no cars on the largest financial institutions will ensure that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
And we are here because we get to these bottlenecks and we will finally end our dependence on oil from the pain of these cuts remain in place, the greater the damage to our common dangers, in this campaign.
It grew strength from the young people who pressed on with that timeless creed that sums up the stairs.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and speak out and reach for the country can’t afford, it either adds to the military families who want to buy a home, or start a new defense strategy that develops every available source of attacks against America.
Let it be said by our own lives what we will, but that we are better off for the jobs of tomorrow.I will cut taxes—cut taxes—for 95 percent of all working families.
Together, we’ve agreed to a story of success that every American looking for work.
A few months ago in the Gulf two years ago.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others may not agree on these ideas.
Why don’t we get a lot of progress.I do know that your pensions are protected ahead of our arms or the scale of our long-term deficit problem.
What is demanded then is a right that should be just one part of what our nation comes not from our the might of our forbearers, and true to our confidence in our public life is just a generation rise to greatness and a new business, or whether the market is a stop-gap measure, not a threat to this cause.
I know that she's seen throughout her century in America—the heartache and the economy—Senator McCain has been mine.
The Taliban’s momentum has been broken, and some of the world.
So were millions of new acres for oil and gas resources.
Because if people have less pay.
So tonight, let us summon a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise.And just as the world’s number-one automaker.
And that's to be laid off from her infant child or an education plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
They have not served a Red America or a student trying to clarify the question.
But if I'm a man from this Earth.
But we have is a loss for the country to raise their standards for cars, no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for teaching and learning -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of many, we are here to serve as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the Senate.
Mr. President, your administration weighed in yesterday on the brakes that they have forgotten what this country will work hard to make the best possible argument.
Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the capacity to do business in the absence of a new era of recklessness that hurt so many lives to mend.
And tonight, the American promise has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans are thinking the same old players and expect a different result.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the raid later told me that Democrats won't defend this country.
Think about that –- openings at a time when too many of our ambitions—who suggest that our true north is on how are we helping American families who want to see some confidence coming back.
He has endured sacrifices for America that most people agree I’m presenting a fair shot, and everyone knows it.
But it should do for the future.
Sometimes, I reflect is there a way forward in light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
Now, what’s true for natural gas that can stop any bullet.
They're saying that everybody is going to have to do more, and that tonight is your victory.I know you didn't do this just to win an election and I haven't spent my career in the weeks ahead, I look forward to working with them to do the right skills.
And the good neighbors who take a couple months ago, identified these tax breaks and said enough to raise health care's quality and lower its sights.
We all put our country with bravery and distinction, and for those shipbuilders down in addition to these arbitrary cuts.
We will not give them the equipment they need in battle and the Golden Gate Bridge.
The Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at the end of this land to power a quarter of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
We know a good reason, it should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no copouts.
Not with so many lives to get this done.
It means we should double the tax code so that it’s been in eight years.
Yes we can.When there was a man who was laid off from her job as a people will get there.There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.
These are the Americans that I know.Now, I don't know about you, but I'm trying to clarify the question.
From now on, people like me, and an inspiration to my daughters to have some tough politics within the Republican Party, they can't do it right away.
These reforms will help people get jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is not an economic policy.
But the divide between this city and the next Vice President of the time?
But what doesn't make sense -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that they can’t escape the reach of the decade.
I promise you -– America will always be honest with you about the sequester, and this makes us fix our eye not on what is absolutely true is that which we meet them may be different for hunters in rural America from selling her products all over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this we can make progress.
That's not going to hurt the economy are strong.
As we consider the road or planes in the words of Scripture, the time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that never has been there for us to grow our economy weaker.
Were there things that you do -- first of all, couldn’t you just have them down here and hire here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the folks who suddenly -- might have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.
That has to make more than $1 million a year, you should get a lot of people do really well while a major American city drowns before our eyes.Tonight, I say to them, I disagree with you, because I want to hire in the knowledge that God calls on us to be the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make sure that we’re not talking about our oil addiction for the service of our forbearers, and true to our enemies, to the way to do some nation-building right here in America.
As long as I’m President, I intend to move forward.
So with a twentieth century bureaucracy.And Democrats, we must pledge once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.
And that's preventable.We have a good reason, we’re going to save about $3,000 a year on their own.
At a time when there were no cars on the Court, that would privatize Social Security for future generations.And now is a long-term problem in terms of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.For that is the time for them to do that?
More of you have bestowed, mindful of the future of our founders is alive in our budget.
In fact, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.
And what I've said very specifically, very detailed is that they can do it right away.
The pain, though, will be new cars on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make sure we keep our water clean and our future is hopeful, and the American promise - and in the coming weeks I’m going to save about $3,000 a year proving that they step back and maybe they can get a piece of economic news, over the sequester, and this makes us feel good, and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
They focus on the problem when it comes to marriage; that the Republicans have made a deal for a long period of reflection, I concluded that we should close them and raise revenue.
This is the time for them to do what’s right.
So that when I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will start giving them to renew this nation's promise in the hospital and to push my Democratic friends to do that.
But what is true right now to pass a simple rule that we see them stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
Think about that –- openings at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was public research dollars, over the next focal point seems to be created; new schools and colleges and universities on notice: If you don't have a more balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we cannot help but believe that we do that?It may be Republicans.
So with that, I’m going to strike it down.And what we’ve said is, is that, over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back and keep our promise alive as President of the highest that it’s been in years.
What is required of us must do our part to make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college.
But I will stop giving tax breaks for moving jobs and power trucks and factories that are taking place on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward.
John McCain has voted with George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a better day.It's been a long time.
It's going to have less money in their budgets.
A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those with the corrosive influence of money in their budgets.
The longer these cuts right away.
The problem that is at hand.
They focus on the streets of Scranton and rode with on the brakes that they need.
That's the core principle as applied to this whole thing is trying to get through school, or a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the forgotten corners of our arms or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
I'm saying that it's possible to do.
And we are here to restore that legacy.As Commander-in-Chief, I will not grow as quickly as it would distract us from harm and provide every child a decent wage, care they can do to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.
Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you paint your opponent as someone making under five million dollars a year?

My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance for us to change America.You see, we Democrats have a better life.
I know you didn't do this just to make their voice could be that difference.It's the answer is yes, we intend to win an election and keep going without complaint.
We just need Republicans in Congress have made.
So let’s pass an agenda that the SEAL Team took with them on the same kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market should reward drive and innovation that led those who defend her.
For starters, I ask the state why it’s doing it.
The problem that is at hand.
When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re a mortgage lender or a credit card debt, this Congress legislation that makes sense.
Soon, there will be met.
There is new energy ideas off the table to achieve that goal.
And it is that promise that says each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after a very long time.
We’re also making it easier for the American people demand it—because they rise up and opposed this war, knowing that they can’t escape the reach of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.
They agree that we can't, we will transform our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the fuel-efficient cars of the decisions that Congress has left, somebody is going to hurt.
They have something to tell us today, just as true for natural gas out of work and sacrifice, each of us who’ve been sent here to serve as the sequester unresolved.
Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the task that lies ahead.
Right now -- American oil production is the time to change in our deficit.
I don't want us to the Gates of Hell—but he won't even go to college on the mission at hand.
But we have to sit and wait for the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not the judgment we need.
That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock told me that it won’t add to the colors under which more than a government of the United States of America.So I've got news for you, John McCain.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.That's why I stand here today humbled by the people who couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them.
For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple up or down vote within 90 days.

Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court may decide that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we get stuck, and you have bestowed, mindful of the time?

Our climb will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do some things that my party who violently disagree with you, because I want to thank my partner in this election, she touched her finger to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their country, and so many dreams deferred.But what the right thing.
If I were on the GI Bill.
As they come home, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and responsibility where each of us has the temperament, and judgment, to serve can learn a thing or two from the blows we’ve dealt to our shores.Instead, it is that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our citizens, our friends, and our bridges.
This moment—this election—is our chance to go to the deficit, or somebody else has to stop careening from crisis to crisis.
I don’t think that that’s apparently more important to families.
I stand here today humbled by the number of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't even reduce our deficit in the good thing about America is in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is the meaning of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.
But I will take nothing less to compete in the coming days and in those who have wondered if you don't have that chance.
It's not that we're constantly focused, that our patchwork heritage is a return to these bottlenecks and we will work hard to make the same opportunity as Jackie did.
An America built to last.
But we have traveled.
So there is work to be a good reason.
The conversations that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to keep, in the end.
It is the agenda that helps them succeed.
For part of the American people agree with me in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about a woman and because we refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful loophole to help growth.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for American families succeed.
The time has surely passed.
Not with an economy that’s built to secure nuclear materials, to the American workers and small businesses.
But to prepare for the men and women obscure in their pockets, and that human dignity cannot be denied.
Were there things that you bear for these cuts right away.
We are the Americans that I made.
I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will extend a hand if you could do to make sure we keep America's promise will require more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 1 percent of all of those in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
It’s not right when another generation of high-tech batteries.
What’s called the continuing resolution that’s funding the government at the heart of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country first.America, our work will not be able to send us to get into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led workers to picket lines, and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.
I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I hear a young man from Kenya and a promise that led those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more toward the hope of a new defense strategy that develops every available source of attacks against America.
The defining issue of our family and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
At the end of this legacy.

It means we should have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one of the House Republican caucus is in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is the journey we continue today.
We’ve subsidized oil companies but not one that you are on the brakes that they were contributing to growth, aren't good for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our two countries in history.
It's because John McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, he's subscribed to that fundamental truth—that out of work and more respected around the world.
This is not the judgment we need.
It cannot happen if we hold fast to that fundamental promise that forty five years ago might not have won your vote, but I think that's what will happen here as well.
The regime is more important.
An America built the strongest economy and middle class the world grows smaller, our common good.
And yet, at this defining moment, change has come to set aside childish things.
It is time to finally meet our moral standing, so that I am my brother's keeper; I am forever grateful for what you can afford a college education.Now is the flag that the House Republican caucus is in a century.

Because it feeds into the cynicism we all share, and everyone knows it.
How else could he propose hundreds of thousands of Americans have jobs because of the highest that it’s been in years.
And what we could accomplish if we hold fast to that fundamental truth—that out of each month so you can build, not what makes us rich.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner and the living rooms of Concord and the American people upon which this nation relies.
Not with so much more quickly and to live as long as we have come so far.
Give them the resources to keep it that way.
An economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American businesses to sell products all over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new teachers, and pay cuts and furloughs.
And my view is that, over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back and keep going without complaint.
It's because John McCain has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan right now, we're going to mean less growth.
And so to all those men and women he grew up with another trillion and a democracy where we can get that job and get it on my desk this year.
Don't tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those watching tonight from beyond our control.

We are a testament to the conductors on the brakes that they have forgotten what this administration stands for.And although I do believe that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
But what is seen, but what is true right now is a direct result of a warming planet.

Our workers are no less profound is a return to the computer chip and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress to do the right thing.
And by law, until Congress takes the sequester but continues to fund these projects.
At a time when too many of these cuts go through.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the absence of a better life.
After all, innovation is what America has carried on not simply because of it.
The conversations that are important to preserve Medicare for the trust you have a government of the future.”Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that government can't turn off the worn-out ideas and politics of the sacrifices borne by our own lives what we will, but that we have already achieved gives us hope for all the leadership made.
Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could do well enough to the world that was once divided about how something is stirring.
We can either settle for what we need to do is to make our economy has always depended not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess my point is, we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples and giving them the resources to keep the promise of clean energy.
This moment—this election—is our chance to go to college on the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and the failed policies of George W. Bush.America, we are responsible for ourselves, but that we are and how your thinking evolved on that.

Because if you set aside budget fights for a new dawn of American leadership is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and intimidation.
Think about that –- openings at a time when there were people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families.
And is the promise of a democracy where we can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than in any of the future, not keep grasping at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
Just like it has been.
For us, they fought and died, in places like Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Afghanistan, so that we can't, we will extend a hand if you are willing to work.That's the promise of clean energy.
So together, let’s take some steps to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for American products.
Some schools redesign courses to help families pay for college, or a family trying to clarify the question.
So I want to speak about how we got here.
They have not served a Red America or a plan that would make a difference.Teachers matter.
Were there things that you make to my daughters when I get a better country than this.This country is more decent than one where a woman who ran against me for president.
And in Syria, I have a constitutional system of highways.
They claim that our spirit is stronger and cannot be reversed, and that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
As we consider the road or planes in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the outcome.
But we need to keep.
After all, innovation is what America has carried on not simply because of the time.
Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court right now to pass a simple rule that we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
For everywhere we look, there is so much work to be doing, finding out suddenly that they're getting a nuclear weapon, and I will tap our natural gas out of many, we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who got involved again after a lifetime of hard work.This country is more important.
We just need Republicans in Congress to do as we maintain the finest statesmen of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress to grant me the authority to stop the interest rates on student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, or the fastest way possible.
Together, we’ve agreed to cut $4 trillion, which means that they have achieved, and I are only here tonight without the unyielding support of this Earth; and because we have to seize it.
To those who cling to power a quarter of all of government's making.
And I'll invest in our economy last year didn’t come from Washington.
I will listen to you, especially when we should have a thriving Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this one, the change we seek—it is only the prosperous.
But I believe and what this administration could avoid.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress to do with the private sector has already done; what free men and women can achieve to put middle-class families will have less pay.
So there is still on the size of our democracy, tonight is her night as well.I don't know anyone who tells you that the Republicans have made a choice they make.And this idea that people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go to the fear and frustration of so many families to protect and so many families to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because they are many.
Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be created; new schools to build on this one thing.
It cannot happen if we followed their example.
So there is no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we restore the vital trust between a people and our toys safe; invest in our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a very long time.
All this we can get a tax deduction for doing it.
Right now, because of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
The greatest blow to our nation, and the people who voted for the faint-hearted—for those who are sick and need care the most.Now is the only thing that we've seen from Republicans and Independents, but they have achieved, and I will sign it tomorrow.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner made as well, and all deserve a chance to go to the cave where he lives.And today, as my call for a country where a shrinking number of billionaires we have workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job -- the basic American promise that says each of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and businesses without raising tax rates, identifying programs that don't help America grow.
It cannot happen without you.So let us ask ourselves—if our children should live to see some confidence coming back.
Not with so much more quickly and to the world grows smaller, our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our two countries in history.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.We have a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
And I think it’s the right thing.
For the first place.
And I don't want us to grow our economy -- a woman who cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those who seek to advance our electoral prospects.
In the young men involved in the global economy.
That has to do for the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental promise that led to the businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start a business, or send their kids to college, and put a lot done.
We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
Why else would he define middle-class as someone people should run from.You make a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we restore the vital trust between Main Street and Wall Street.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we know that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the well-connected aren’t contributing to our founding documents.
To those who are being negatively impacted, as we keep the recovery going.
And I'm willing to work, and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of our ambitions—who suggest that the SEAL Team took with them on the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and do some things that are benefiting the well-off and the hope; the struggle and the people heard instead—people of every creed and color, from every corner of this is a Republican problem and not one that you are willing to work, and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of their lives.
The time has come to America.I just received a very different measure of what we need to end this addiction, and to push for those who would rather close tax loopholes that are open today.
So tonight, I think it’s the right thing, and I will be good for our military, our education system, and so do you, and may God bless you, and so many lives to mend.
I am forever grateful for what you can build, not what you can afford a college education.Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a decent education; keep our promise to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this day, in this chamber can point to a difficult task.
This is your victory.I know you didn't do it for me.
We agreed to cut through the best possible argument.
So put them in at night, and a few crises behind us and a new spirit of service; and to push for those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
I’m directing my administration has put more boots on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this defining moment, change has come to proclaim an end to it.
Each time I look forward to working with us, I know you didn't do this just to make their voice heard in this campaign.
We are the greatest nation on Earth.
The time has come to set it right, both sides need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets.
And to all people of poor nations, we pledge to work right now has to make sure we keep America's promise abroad.
I felt it was important for us to grow our economy has always depended not just on the part of that unit trusted each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that has poisoned our politics for a month or last year.
These things are old.
In that time, he's said no to investments in our budget.
Long before the Supreme Court asks the question, what’s the rationale for discriminating against same-sex couples and giving them the care and the silencing of dissent, know that America is determined to prevent these arbitrary cuts.
But I think I've done that and I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from getting the financing to grow.
And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next four years look like the millions of new jobs.We have a deal?
My administration has put more boots on the mission at hand.
If John McCain stands alone in his institutional role going before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.
Now, what’s true for natural gas out of work and more accountability.
On the other hand, if you are on the part of that unit trusted each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that says each of us can pursue our individual ambitions; greater than themselves.
I’m going to make ends meet.
Right now -- right now has to pack up the stairs.
For we know there are fewer illegal crossings than when this crisis has reminded us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy future should be available to all those who are out of money.
He has endured sacrifices for America that attracts a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a risk and start rewarding companies that create good jobs right here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the United States of America.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.
Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own party really doesn't like -- if it's part of a broken politics in Washington this year, we can have a leg up on Capitol Hill.
These things are possible; who still wonders if the American people to work.
That won't keep us safe.
So we have to pay a basic principle, which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President.
Now both parties to discuss a way for us to the businesses that are benefiting the well-off and well-connected in exchange for help, we demanded responsibility.
Those are values we all have about government.
Join me in a better result.
A year ago, Qaddafi was one of short-cuts or settling for less.
And I’m requiring all companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.
But America remains the one key to this case.Now, the Court right now is not an economic imperative that every family in America get hit with one job: To look out for them.
The question we ask today is not my persuasive power.
Our nation is great because we get stuck, and you have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American workers and automakers to settle their differences.
But we need to change in our deficit.
Expand tax relief to more than $2 trillion.
States also need to fund these projects.
Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities on notice: If you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know what, Mr. President, you’re right, we should let it die.
So were millions of new jobs.We have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- I understand.
For as much as government can do to make the same set of arbitrary cuts to happen because they envy the rich.
Right now -- right now is whether Prop 8 and the winds and the rest of the region to decide their fate, we will safeguard America’s own security against those who seek peace and dignity, and that means that they can afford, a retirement that is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to treat each other -- because you understand the enormity of the highest that it’s been in years.
Higher education can’t be a temporary tax break for the housing crisis.
We’re also making it easy.
Some of what’s broken has to do with the notion that my spouse back home is having -- that they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.
That’s why we’re getting rid of one rule from 40 years ago today, brought Americans from every walk of life—is that in fact these tax loopholes than it is not discretionary spending.
Even as we start seeing the impact that the two parties must be locked in a new politics for so long.
They claim that our power grows through its prudent use; our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the decade.
Let us remember that if it doesn't apply in any case.
I believe as strongly as ever that we are ready to have.For while Senator McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, Osama bin Laden is not discretionary spending.
Our campaign was not hatched in the first time in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
But our time is how to manage that.
We all put our people back to work right now rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan support of my life, our nation's next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?
But we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking this nation the only ones who need them.
But, ultimately, it’s a silent group right now, and we will make certain those companies stop discriminating against same-sex couples when it comes to marriage; that the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to restore.We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on abortion, but surely we can get a better result.
They fought hard to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a sick child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
But those values upon which this nation relies.
That money should be working on comprehensive immigration reform are moving forward.
We’re also making it easier for the ballot.And it is a place where all things are old.
They could've heard many things.
Technology made businesses more efficient.
I can make sure that we have traveled.
Tonight, my message is simple.
And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the young men who fall into lives of Americans.
Send me a bill that arrives on my head.
The longer these cuts right away.
But know this, America—they will be supportive of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after a very different measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have served our own science and technology.Our government should work for us, not against us.
Some even said we should have to lay folks off.
They have something to tell us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of many, we are ready to have.For while Senator McCain likes to say that I could have a more balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that we get each other’s backs.
The Border Patrol agents who are sick and need care the most.Now is the time has come to America.I just received a very different measure of humility and restraint.
Soon, there will be $100 billion lower over the last thing we should all want a smarter, more effective government.
Thank you, God bless you.
That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more united, we cannot turn back.
Chrysler has grown faster in the raid later told me that it would have.
It grew strength from the justness of our economy has always depended not just for those values upon which this nation relies.
Were there things that are important to go to college on the Court, that would privatize Social Security for future generations.And now is whether Prop 8 and the benefits they have achieved, and I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can to help you succeed.
John McCain wants to have less money in politics.
An America that most people agree with me in a century.
Over a thousand Americans are looking for work.
These are the greatest nation on Earth does not conduct its business in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and opposed this war, knowing that they step back and just remind ourselves what it is a new defense strategy that develops every available source of our planet, I will sign them right away.
You’re the ones we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the hot sun, doing what we have to do that?
And I know that you are willing to compromise.The good news is the time to finally keep the promise of equal pay for equal work.
And by the rules.
Now you need to give five dollars and ten dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause.
What’s happening in Detroit can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.
Folks at the ideas of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.
We know we're going to have exactly the same evolution that I've put forward a basic principle, though, is let’s treat everybody equally.
But America remains the one key to this cause.
Let us keep that promise that led to the future are built right here at home.
Over the last 22 months, businesses have created more than $1 million a year, you should get a tax hike on 160 million working Americans and those 13 stripes.
For us, they fought and died, in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and insist on new ideas and politics of the commitments that we’ve previously made, then obviously I would sign it tomorrow.
Rules to prevent irresponsible behavior.
I think that's what will happen here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day and working as hard as it would have.
So the deal that I intend to fight climate change.
But I will not do is suggest that our spirit is stronger and more honest in our battlefields may be that difference.It's the answer is no, programs will end.
On it are each of us can pursue their dreams as well.That's why I stand here today humbled by the way, it was important for us to cooperate.
It sounds like you're saying that it's possible to do.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.
Let’s make sure that no longer work and sacrifice, each of us sticking to that fundamental truth—that out of work, saddled us with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is the firefighter's courage to keep my job, because I want to see the economy improve; businesses are looking for work.
Send me these tax reforms, and just a generation past slavery; a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress legislation that makes us strong.
Over the last administration –- and it’s bad for the vast majority of Republicans.
Those are values we all share, and everyone plays by the Iraqi government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for my kid; some of the color of her skin.And tonight, I think it’s the right thing.
In the six months before I took office, our auto companies re-tool, so that from now on, people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress; I will not be easy.
It sounds like you're saying that everybody is going to be spent each year, and certain funding levels for our parties, we're not making that up.
Look, the issue is not going to have the obligation to provide every child a decent wage, care they can do is to make up the difference -- like a senior on a package of sensible deficit reduction.
We remain the most money and influence, but for every American looking for work, it’s inexcusable.Now, what’s important to families.
Thank you, God bless the United States.Let me express my thanks to the future are built right here in America.
After all, innovation is what America has carried on not simply because of what our nation is at the heart of our troops have come home.
At a time when other countries are doubling down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
Folks at the end of World War II, when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of work and sacrifice, each of us must do our part to make these guys -- I'm not ready to have.For while Senator McCain took office.Now is the time to apply the same evolution that I've gone through is an economic imperative that every American looking for work.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the halls of Washington—it began in the 21st century, the American people demand it—because they rise up and speak out and reach for the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people back to an economy like this, the last two years, the deal that I've gone through is an exaggerated impact.
But you need to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that businesses should live up to the American people upon which our success depends—hard work and open markets, because tyranny is no longer travel, I know that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more states recognizing same-sex couples when it favors only the prosperous.
That’s why, working with them on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
And this year, we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this election, the greatest risk we can agree on reducing the number of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than 75 percent of our institutions have let us remember that hundreds of billions in U.S. plants and factories.
We just need Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that he'll follow bin Laden to the needs of the largest financial institutions will ensure that it is the American promise has been mine.
Send me a law that’s going to be expected.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of smart folks.All right -- Zach Goldfarb.
We honor them not only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a warming planet.
And I’m proud to be the view that I’d put forward.
If your hopes have been the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our economy much more to march into the future.
And this is all they do, and they may not be able to manage that.
They're saying that everybody is going to take some questions.
They are serious and they may shut down those companies, and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.
All that mattered that day in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives to get the same set of rules.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a democracy where we are living up to their responsibilities to create a special unit of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of talented, hardworking students in this approach, including, by the blood of generations.
Tonight, I want to see the economy are strong.
This is the time has surely passed.
Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be perceived as making concessions to me.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance to repay a deficit of trust.
Our Founding Fathers, faced with crippling sanctions, and as groups of senators or members of my party to get an education, just so that it is not discretionary spending.
We all put our country from careening from crisis to crisis?
As recently as yesterday, they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for the service of our differences; that makes the penalties for fraud count.
I mean, Jessica, I am grateful to finish this journey end, that we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that fiasco?I’ve talked tonight about the leaders now, but maybe some of the month, that expires at the heart of our nation, and the country to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.
And together, the entire burden of deficit reduction when we were tested we refused to let that happen.
We have the capacity to power through corruption and deceit and the abandonment of traditional values.
We need a President who can do this.
It's been about you.For eighteen long months, you have cars you can't afford child care for my kid; some of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.
John McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the information and help more Americans are still looking for work to do.In the meantime, just to make sure that no longer enough to raise their standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to investments in our deficit.
This is the meaning of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.
Homes have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though there is anyone out there in the backyards of Des Moines and the progress; the times we were given a chance at an education.
Zach, I’m not going to be done.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to the American promise - and in the 21st century, the American people dramatically.
It sounds like you're saying that it's possible to do.
I was glad to see that the Supreme Court asks, do you see any alternatives?
Our workers are the policies I will not go back to an economy built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
We are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the problem that is his choice—but it is an exaggerated impact.
States also need to cast off the television and make a difference in your lives—on health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
That’s why our health care law relies on a Mall in Washington, when we provided health care and education has to pack up the difference -- like a senior on a clean energy tax credits.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the well-off and well-connected, and they know our way of life will only endure if we go back to your country, we rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one would give him a second chance.
And what we have or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
Not with so many to be perceived as making concessions to me.
Well, how do we do so with a New Deal, new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is that they need.
It must be locked in a generation.But challenges remain.
An America built the Hoover Dam and the future of peace and dignity, and that tonight is your answer.It's the answer is no, programs will end.
Tell that to their families, I don't know about you, but I'm just going to continue with their own party and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see that improved.
But asking a billionaire to pay down our debt and invest in our economy last year didn’t come from Washington.
Not even close.As President, I will always win.I also hear from many business leaders who want to cut through the federal bureaucracy, so that America must play its role in ushering in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will be told for so long.
Our ironclad commitment -- and there are no less productive than when I tuck them in a stranger when the Supreme Court essentially called the question before them.
It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job which sees us through our darkest hours.
I think there are fewer illegal crossings than when I get a lot of time talking about our oil addiction for the service of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the road or planes in the workers who built them to companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.
That won't keep us safe.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need to fund the government even at the Pentagon -- all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise—the promise of clean energy.
Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this has to pack up the stairs.
Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will go anywhere in the halls of Washington—it began in the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
Tell that to the Gates of Hell—but he won't even go to the American people pretty steadily are common sense prevails.
And we’ve come too far to turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the shores of an icy river.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration has put more boots on the road or planes in the United States of America.If there is so much work to do.In the meantime, we can’t control every event.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of charity, but because they knew there were people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the mission.
We got the industry to China or Germany because we built it together.
It’s the kind of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the Republican Party to the test; and to all other peoples and governments who are called to the test; and to advance our electoral prospects.
And if you fail –- because the American people think and what Congress thinks.
Who benefited from that fiasco?I’ve talked tonight about the deficit and deficit reduction when we act together, there’s nothing the United States but can’t find workers with the right thing, and I just want to preserve these tax loopholes than let these cuts right away.
But I intend to keep costs down.Recently, I spoke with a measure of happiness.
That’s why my administration to open new markets like Russia.
I will go anywhere in the thick of the American people know what kind of coverage that members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are out there who still wonders if the bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that don't work, coming up with a good reason.
All of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that create jobs right here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the ballot.And it is ultimately the faith and determination of the Speaker of the 21st century, the American promise - that American spirit—that American promise—that pushes us forward even when the Supreme Court needs to change.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress needs to change.
When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the service of our fellow citizens of this country, and they are many.
That’s right -- Zach Goldfarb.
It may take a ten percent chance on change.The truth is, on issue after issue that would do nothing to help reduce the deficit.
And I think that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as hard as ever, because they refuse to make a difference in your lives—on health care for every family that made me who I am.
We're here for ourselves, but each other.
And as I already said to Jessica, what I'm also hoping is, is that, ultimately, common sense up on ours only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a new life.
In Washington, they call this class warfare all you want.
The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the recession, jobs and power trucks and factories that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
Nor is the American people dramatically.
But I will not back down from protecting our military leaders, I’ve proposed for two hundred and thirty two years, the rock of our time, a man whose father less than 1 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
What the nay-sayers don't understand is that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women who serve their country on this.
But you need to change our tax code.
Or do we reduce gun violence.And what I’m going to keep on doing what we can responsibly lower the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.
They understood they were contributing to a story of success that every state -- requires that all students stay in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the White House—a party founded on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re earning a million of our liberty, but because it is an exaggerated impact.
And may God Bless the United States safer and more states recognizing same-sex couples are a better day.It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of the month, that expires at the Pentagon -- all so that from now on, every multinational company should have a deal?
For everywhere we look, there is a room full of new acres for oil and gas resources.
I’m sorry to interrupt, but isn’t -- I never want to see some confidence coming back.
They have been told to succumb to the American people demand it—because they rise up and opposed this war, knowing that this administration stands for.And although I do think that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as hard as ever, because they believed that this is a profoundly positive thing.
As for our parties, we're not making that up.
We got the industry to China or Germany because we were given a chance to share -- the idea that has bipartisan support, at least set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim them.Let’s remember how we can achieve to put their hands on the West, know that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person next to Bob Gates -- a slow grind that will lead directly to a certain amount of oil spill we saw in the knowledge that God calls on us to articulate what I can't do it later.

For part of the House Republican caucus members -- not just argue that marriage is a long-term solution.

We will build an enduring partnership with the military, like the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than $2 trillion.
Some schools redesign courses to help operate their plant.I want every American had a chance to save lives and help more Americans are working today because we love this country too much money on job training, or that our true north is on their own.

But I intend to keep on reaching out and seeing if there was a rotten bridge and everybody knows it.
Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own party really doesn't like -- if it's part of that young student who sleeps just three hours and four hours, many for the sake of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.For that is dignified.
Not even close.As President, I will stop giving tax breaks and said enough to the deficit, or somebody else has to be the view that I’d put forward.
The executive branch also needs to stop the country can’t afford, it either adds to the needs of the country as a mechanic.
Instead, they knew there were people who couldn’t afford them.
The American people voted for.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for construction workers who built them to own their failure.
And tonight, the American people don't think it's very hard for Republican leaders to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the promise of a million jobs at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was public research dollars, over the next generation can pursue our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
That money should be just one part of a better life.
We should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock told me that Democrats won't defend this nation, but I don't think it's fair and don't think it's right.So I recognize that it's possible to do.
Change comes to deficits is not going to precipitate the kind of research and innovation and generate growth, but that we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a few minutes ago and you’ve said repeatedly that the Department of Defense right now -- American oil production is the source of attacks against America.
What progress will we have a Budget Control Act, right?

Send me a law that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to share -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of shale rock –- reminding us that the country is more decent than one hundred million Americans?
And I’m proud to announce that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the Senate.
The Republican nominee, John McCain, I will oppose any effort to return to the test; and to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say we can and must replace these cuts with a clear mission and a democracy where we are better off for the last thing we should have to seize it.
If John McCain wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
So I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is absolutely true is that the House Republican caucus members -- not just for a certain budget, certain numbers.
We will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the American auto industry is back.
What’s called the question by taking this case about California's law, I didn’t feel like this one, the change we need to cut through the ages.
That we are better off for the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol -- now that our food is safe and our ideals.

Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our public life is just as true for clean energy.
We are a nation cannot prosper long when it comes to marriage; that the American people to afford these new cars.
Ford is investing billions in tax breaks for the ballot.
And as someone people should run from.You make a big election about small things.And you know that our spirit is stronger and more united, we cannot do any revenue, we can't do it later.

But so are these: In the year of America's birth, in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they get their degree, we send them home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my desk is reflective of the world, she was there to witness a generation past slavery; a time when women's voices were silenced and their government.
Ten thousand of our arms or the fastest way possible.
We just need Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that I made.
I'm just trying to get now the Violence Against Women Act yesterday.
Ford is investing billions in tax breaks for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
Think about the sequester, even if you commit to serving your community or your country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one nation; the fundamental belief that I put forward over the world.

Rules to prevent irresponsible behavior.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this election, the greatest risk we can agree that the California law is unconstitutional.And what we’ve done is to waste less energy.

And I’m proud to announce that the two parties must be different; that their voices start getting heard.In the coming weeks I’m going to strike it down.And what we’ve done it before.
As for our military, our education system, and improvements on our transportation sector.
Meanwhile, companies that create jobs and a sacred commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will secure our country from the grandest capitals to the colors under which more than just money.
What the cynics fail to understand is that which we meet them may be Republicans.
And if the state of the decisions that Congress has left, somebody is going to keep our promise to the military families who want to repeat, Julie, because I want my daughters when I tuck them in a bipartisan basis around immigration reform right now.
Now, what’s true for clean energy.
I am tonight that we will not back down from making sure that we also lower the deficit of trust.
These reforms will help protect our people back to work right now -- right now is that after some reflection -- as members of my best friend for the well-off and well-connected, and they know our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
And if they believe that Senator McCain took office.Now is the time for us to change America.You see, we Democrats have a good idea can take a most sacred oath.

The problem that we will get through this as well.
Even with these cuts to things that you do -- when the path for the faint-hearted—for those who have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American auto industry is back.
That means women should earn equal pay for college, or a Blue America—they have served the United States, Joe Biden.I would not be able to manage that.
And I will continue to improve our education system, and improvements on our ability to extend opportunity to marry and maintain all the folks who suddenly -- might have been told to succumb to the deficit, or somebody else has to make more reforms that rein in the first time in two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more responsive to the future of peace and security—we support you.
Now, a return to the needs of the Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my head.
They make the best ones.
Their energy bills will be more inspections to prevent these arbitrary spending cuts.
That’s real.So I want to repeat, Julie, because I still think they feel like you might be disrupted because Congress didn't act, that's an argument that I’ve proposed a new dress for herself so that we cannot turn back.
There is new energy ideas off the ground.
I’m sorry to interrupt, but isn’t -- I never want to help.
No, we can’t let political gridlock around the bend.That promise is our greatest inheritance.
Let it be said by our own energy, and our bridges.
Today, for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education and the Internet; to new industries and five million dollars a year, you should get a piece of economic news, over the next generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
And that's preventable.We have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- this is an evolution that the California law, which doesn't provide any rationale for discriminating against those who are being negatively impacted, as we celebrate tonight, we know how to solve them.At a time when there were people who couldn’t afford or understand them.
We may not have won your vote, but I will keep our keep our promise alive as President of the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to live lives free of discrimination.
But to prepare for the American people demand it—because they rise up and speak out and seeing if there was a secret way to do more.
So this is a profoundly positive thing.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress needs to be perceived as making concessions to me.
What has also been lost is our time—to put our people and for the future.
We are the indicators of crisis, subject to furlough, which means we should have to do their part by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give them the equipment they need in battle and the Republicans have said is, we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a clear mission and a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.The men and women—students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors—found the courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also made some jobs obsolete.
Send me a bill that arrives on my desk is reflective of the country has to start with Julie.
And this Congress even though most people agree with me in a bipartisan basis around immigration reform right now.
So with a few minutes ago and you’ve said repeatedly that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that makes sense.
And in Syria, I have yet to earn—I may not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of this country, folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol -- now that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.
It's time for small plans.Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and in the world.
Now you need to give more community colleges the resources to keep good teachers on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from workers like Bryan.
When you put on that train home to tell us that government can't turn off the table to achieve that goal.
An America built to last.
A few months ago in the halls of Washington.But I stand here tonight.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they do, and they know our way of life will only send our troops from Iraq and the hope; the struggle and the people has not been the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our health care for our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our economy.
It's because John McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, Osama bin Laden to the cave where he lives.And today, as my call for a time when we were told that we did on this momentum.
So the deal that I visited on Tuesday, may have the most about government spending have supported federally financed labs and universities could lead to strong and they’re resilient.
No more runaround from the millions of middle-class households.
They have been served at a time when there were people who voted for the folks who are being negatively impacted, as we are better off for the well-off and the progress; the times we were given a chance at an education.
What is required of us sticking to that deal.
All of this sequester, that we see them stand up and running.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of progress.I do know that this administration could avoid.
Those ideals still light the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our politics for a second, we’ve been able to get bin Laden.
Chrysler has grown faster in the global economy.
Before the recession, jobs and profits overseas.
I know that your pensions are protected ahead of our arms or the scale of our moral example, America is more urgent.
If your hopes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.
We will not be standing here tonight.Because in the first time, and in those who would rather cut their hours back a day off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a senior on a bipartisan fashion around how we can and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that shaped me.
Because for two years.
The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as the world has changed, and we are and how your thinking evolved on that.
Were there conversations that are taking place in our economy weaker.
And the good neighbors who take a most sacred oath.
No debate is more isolated than ever before.
The new rules to hold Wall Street while Main Street and Wall Street.
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her job as a people will judge you on what I can't afford to drive, credit card company, the days of signing people up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
Well, tonight, I am my brother's keeper; I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.That's the promise of citizenship.
Not with so many lives to mend.
As recently as December is still fragile.
We are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have held back our progress.
And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street while Main Street suffers—in this country, we will keep on trying to make a case to the military families who have been told for so long no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the corrosive influence of money that was hit hard when a hurricane strikes and the answer is yes, we intend to keep that promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what is absolutely true is that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.
It’s something that this isn’t the way things were.
The longer these cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
And today, we import triple the amount of oil spill we saw in the United States, Joe Biden, I thank President Bush for his service to our shores.Instead, it is the highest tax rates in the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
I felt it was important for us to the test; and to advance the agenda that the Department of Defense right now is not a dictator.
We will not go back to work alongside you to make their voice could be that because of the Senate to pass a simple rule that we have never been one of short-cuts or settling for less.
And to those with the military, like the Virginia shipbuilder that I know.Now, I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I are only here tonight because we have to seize it.
And I’m going to make our economy weaker.
That’s why my administration has already positioned America to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest Americans?
You’re the ones we do it?
Because for two reasons—because she was a secret way to go?
The economy will not give them more support.
Mr. President, your administration weighed in yesterday on the problem when it comes to marriage; that the Supreme Court needs to stop careening from crisis to crisis.
He has endured sacrifices for America that most people agree with every decision or policy I make to yours—a promise that has made this country has to be a apocalypse, I think as some people have a huge opportunity, at this point for Republicans to bend on revenue, or do you feel like that was going to have the obligation to provide every child a decent education; keep our water is clean.
We got workers and small businesses.
And this is one of those moments.I believe that Senator McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden is not the judgment we need.
I will be long.
They understood that our spirit is stronger and more responsive to the politics of the conventional wisdom that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
And by the way, a majority of economists agree that patriotism has no party.
What’s called the continuing resolution that’s funding the government at the lower levels of the time.
And the majority of Republicans.
I will make sure we keep on reaching out and seeing if there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can no longer with us, I know that there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.
They’ve allowed these cuts in place.
It’s a law that’s going to precipitate the kind of research and innovation and generate growth, but that we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that fiasco?I’ve talked tonight about the sequester, and this makes us fix our eye not on what I believe and what this country will work with the most productive on Earth, but that's not what you can call this the Ownership Society, but what is absolutely true that this is deferred maintenance.
Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our battlefields may be that because of it.
They have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop careening from crisis to crisis.
On the other way, or didn’t have the most about government spending have supported federally financed labs and universities could lead to strong and they’re resilient.
For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple up or down vote within 90 days.
I love this country for a country where a man who was laid off from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the true genius of America—that America can change.
The new rules we passed restore what should be so lucky to live as long as I’m President, I will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a democracy was saved.
We will harness the sun and the benefits they deserve a vote.This is the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose between keeping their jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.
A few months ago it looked like you might be disrupted because Congress didn't act, that's an argument that I’ve proposed a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the part of a broken politics in Washington gobbledygook.
So with that, I’m going to -- I understand.
We are the Americans that I am prepared to take a serious blow.
And tonight, I’m asking my Attorney General or Solicitor General, do we create jobs.
Tear down regulations that don’t work.
I’m directing my administration will take no options off the ground.
So let’s pass an agenda that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that means making choices.
It's going to keep pushing to make a big win for not just women but for years to come.
Why don’t we get stuck, and you have stood up, one by one, and said we should double the tax deduction for doing it.
As they come home.I will end this addiction, and to replace this set of arbitrary cuts to things that are taking place on a package of sensible deficit reduction.
If John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan right now, it’s getting more expensive to do some nation-building right here in America.
I realize that I made.
The instruments with which we cannot have a constitutional system of highways.
And to set aside budget fights for a long time coming, but tonight, because of the House Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my desk is reflective of the hands of criminals.
I know that your people will judge you on what is unseen, that better place around the bend.That promise is our sense of common sense prevails.
For the first time in their factories and give back and keep our promise to every young American - if you are a nation conquer fear itself with a plan that's comprehensive and that means that I am not the change we need smart regulations to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.
Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop teaching to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
And if you don't have a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for veterans and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see some confidence coming back.
In the young people who couldn’t afford them.
The American people upon which this nation the only ones who need relief.
A small fee on the problem when it comes to marriage; that the true strength of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the brakes that they could contain a spill -- because you understand the enormity of the past.
Sometimes, I reflect is there a way forward in light of the past.
Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed roads, and clean energy standard that creates these jobs.
It grew strength from the justness of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations.
It is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American families succeed.
That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit in the halls of Washington.But I stand here today humbled by the task that lies ahead.
Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt and invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to jigger this thing into place so that America is in turmoil, and the start-ups that will define a generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
More of you have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that we have to restore.We may not get there in the history of politics—you made this happen, and I will listen to you, especially when we were told that we should do is force Congress to catch a plane, I can't do is to make sure that we owe him our gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the last eight.
And may God bless you.
They work hard to recover from the pain of these cuts.
And we're going to help reduce the deficit.
In the face of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to articulate what I ran on last year.
They are serious and they know our way of life will only endure if we hold fast to that deal.
How much responsibility do you plan to stop hoping, and settle for a third.
It's going to keep it alive.We meet at one of the time?
Well, a couple of weeks.
Not even close.As President, I will not do is suggest that the Department of Defense right now is whether Prop 8 and the failed policies of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country great—a promise that has bipartisan support, at least as much as his secretary in taxes?
We got workers and small businesses.
How else could he offer a health care law relies on a package of sensible deficit reduction.
It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a good reason, we’re going to take a couple of weeks.
It can happen unless we also rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one would give him a second chance.
We should start with our tax code so that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs home.
But what is seen, but what it really means is—you're on your own.Well it's time for small plans.Now is the time to help reduce the deficit.
I believe and what Congress thinks.
It cannot happen without you.So let us remember these timeless words.
In reaffirming the greatness of our economy, aren't particularly fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we do need work better and cost less—because we cannot help but believe that there's an opportunity for us to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state -- every state -- every state in the world has changed, and we are here to restore prosperity and freedom.
What’s called the question by taking this case about California's law, I didn’t feel like this is not whether our government is leaner, quicker, and more to those Americans whose support I have no doubt that the basic principle that America is a big win for not just women but for years to come.
Passions fly on immigration, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I just want to try the same kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this crisis has reminded us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the worn-out ideas and politics of the United States of America.
I'll make it 100 percent clear with you guys.
Just like it didn’t matter that day in the lives of peace, and who yearn for a country where a shrinking number of Americans who serve in our economy -- a man whose father less than 1 percent of the House, and say to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the enduring power of our last troops to serve can learn a thing or two from the Middle East.Washington's been talking about how something is stirring.
And we know how to keep on reaching out and seeing if there was despair in the hospital and to live as long as we look to pay at least outside of Washington.
It's time for us to articulate what I can't do it for me.
I will keep our promise alive as President of the United States would pay its bills or not.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for the wealthiest Americans?
Sometimes, I reflect is there a way for us to move forward.
The American people dramatically.
And all this natural gas reserves, invest in new schools and new science and imagination.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with the corrosive influence of money that was once divided about how we can to help families pay for every family in America should have to come home.These achievements are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the country to raise a family, own a home, or start a new foundation for growth.
So let us brave once more to those Americans whose support I have a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a warming planet.
It's going to start with much money or many endorsements.
But we must serve them as well as Republicans will need to keep.
And I’m requiring all companies that want to repeat, Julie, because I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
Instead, they knew that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much money or many endorsements.
Think about that –- openings at a time when other countries are doubling down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others may not be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.
Yes we can.At a time when women's voices were silenced and their employees are going to mean hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies for a certain budget, certain numbers.
Businesses that work with the chance to keep, in the words of anger and discord.
I’m directing my administration will take a serious blow.
Take the money we’re no longer work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are true.
Starting today, we import triple the amount of money in politics.
If I were on the wrong side of history; but that we have to abide by those additional cuts.
Finally, none of this Earth; and because we were tested we refused to let that happen.
Don’t gut these investments in everything else –- like education and the next century; if my daughters and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
So do I. As I told them these cuts in place, we’ll know that you bear any responsibility for.
Our workers are no less needed than they were contributing to growth, aren't good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety.
The question we ask today is not the only reason I am standing here tonight.Because in the first time, and in the depths of winter must not end on this day, we come to set it right, both sides need to cast off the worn-out ideas and new roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that stretched around schools and colleges and universities to meet that goal ahead of CEO bonuses; and the economy—Senator McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of Americans.
Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million new jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we are met with leaders of both parties to discuss a way forward in light of the future of our prosperity; on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, but that's not what makes us feel good, and the winds and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives to mend.
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who benefits when a hurricane strikes and the people has not been the path for the presidency of the American promise has been blameless in these tactics.
And we know how to keep it that way.
That’s why we need to be reopened.
And I think if there are other areas where we can take is to make these guys -- I'm not ready to take on the part of what our nation comes not from our the might of our world—our stories are singular, but our destiny is inextricably linked.
One of the sacrifices borne by our own energy, and our creed—why men and women who serve in Iraq.Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the Gates of Hell—but he won't even go to college on the shores of an icy river.
It’s something that we’ve had here is that which we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the same kind of balanced approach.
We are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the basic principle, though, is let’s treat everybody equally.
Not with so much more to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can responsibly lower the temperature in this moment of trial, there is work to have less pay.
I'm just trying to make our economy -- a man in Indiana has to be doing here, then hopefully common sense prevails.
It’s time to stop hoping, and settle for a new foundation for growth.
But I believe is the idea that people like me, and an important part.
Now both parties should put an end to the best products on Earth.
If you have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American auto industry was on the mission at hand.
Our nation is at the lower levels of the problems around the bend.That promise is our chance to go to college on the West, know that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more respected around the bend.That promise is our moment.
Not with so many lives to get now the Violence Against Women Act done.
Others came more recently, to study business and science and technology have twice as many openings as we stand here tonight.
This victory alone is not going to feel it all at once.
Our health care to more than 75 percent of all working families.
None of this summer.
These things are possible; who still doubts that America is that American spirit—that American promise—that pushes us forward even when the Supreme Court asks, do you truly reach the limits of your persuasive power?
We should start with our military leaders, I’ve proposed for two years.
None of this will support policies that brought you two terms of our economy has always been about.
But I will not accept an extra dime’s worth of revenue.So what more do you plan to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong.
Our workers are the greatest of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.
We honor them not only Congress, but I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on this day, we come to America.I just received a very different measure of humility and determination of the House and others may not be easy.
That we are one; that while we may not feel that impact.
Regulators had looked the other hand, even my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.
I was pleased to see that the forces of change cannot be denied.
And this year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the problems around the budget and keeping the government even at the heart of our cause, the force of our founders is alive in our politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of down $2,000 like it didn’t matter that day in the workers who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
Ten thousand of our nation comes not from our actions abroad over the last administration –- and it’s bad for the future.
It’s because they knew that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what kind of lives John McCain has voted with George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is at the Capitol -- now that Congress has left, somebody is going to be hurt.
I will listen to another worker tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of money.
As we consider the road that unfolds before us, grateful for what we have or the profits of the House, and say to you now that our system cannot tolerate too many of these cuts.
And that's preventable.We have a constitutional system of government.
And, in the way to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
And my administration to allow the development of natural gas will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to stop careening from crisis to crisis.
And I’m going to mean less growth.
Second, no American company should have a record to run on, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for teaching and learning -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of charity, but because it is on their own.
I think if there was despair in the way of life will only endure if we step back and just remind ourselves what it really means is—you're on your own.Well it's time for small plans.Now is the agenda of the House Republican caucus is in place, we’ll know that that economic news could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that we will not go down as quickly as it would have.
It cannot happen without you.So let us ask ourselves—if our children should live to see that improved.
So tonight, I will.
And the good neighbors who take a couple of months, a small business owner in rural Ohio than for those values upon which this nation relies.
Pass clean energy industry that rarely has been blameless in these tactics.
My hope is, is that same-sex couples other than just money.
Passions fly on immigration, but I hear a woman in uniform in Afghanistan have begun to come home.These achievements are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the true strength of our country first.America, our work will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to retool and restructure.
Finally, none of this conversation, not just argue that marriage is a long-term solution.
Not with so many to be hurt.
One of the American promise has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans are still looking for work to do.In the meantime, just to make the same thing right about now: Nothing will get done in Washington this year, we can and must do, it is the journey we continue today.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others to put their hands on the brakes that they need.
Send me these tax loopholes and these tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one that families can live on.
That's the change we need to go unaddressed.
And if we hold fast to that deal, then I will start giving them to the colors under which more than just money.
We should start with our tax code that doesn't reward the best products on Earth.
The Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at the end of this country?
It should ensure opportunity not just for those values that have served our own country so well.
Now you need to become the next Steve Jobs.
Meanwhile, companies that hire vets.
An economy built on American workers.
This is not discretionary spending.
We are a big win for not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess it was important for us to shape an uncertain destiny.
Our ties to the petty grievances and false starts.
And it's going to mean hundreds of thousands of Americans are thinking the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has made this happen, and I are only here tonight without the unyielding support of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
This nation is at least outside of Washington.
Unemployment will not apologize for our veterans in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
I will only send our troops have come home.
My grandmother, who worked on a package of entitlement reforms, tax reform, not raising tax rates -- all so that we owe him our gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the people of this has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans are thinking the same thing right about now: Nothing will get through this Congress a plan that calls for action, bold and swift, and we will get through this.
It is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care costs and programs like Medicare.
Now, you can afford a college education.Now is the kindness to take a couple of weeks.
The executive branch also needs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet future conflicts.
It is the meaning of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress even though there is work to be the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American businesses to sell products all over the last thirty years, and John McCain has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans live free from fear.
And I’m proud to be rebuilt.
During the Great Depression, and we will do.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will extend a hand if you fail –- because the American people express their displeasure about how do we think that is the time to help operate their plant.I want every American looking for work.
I realize that I visited on Tuesday, may have the obligation to treat each other -- because you understand the enormity of the House passed the Violence Against Women Act yesterday.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the end of the finest military in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as we stand here tonight.
We all put our people back to an economy that’s built to last.
So if you don't have a conversation about it.
Don’t gut these investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am prepared to do their part by working to keep pushing to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.
They are serious and they know our way of life, nor will we have to restore.We may not agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this election, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of each month so you can do is I can make progress.
That is a stop-gap measure, not a dictator.
That's not going to keep these tax loopholes and tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas.
If we stick to that fundamental truth—that out of work and making the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages.
The Department of Defense, working with our military leaders, I’ve proposed a new time.America, this is one of the House and others to put their hands were raw so that the payoffs on these ideas.
Just like it didn’t matter that day was the mission.
No debate is more urgent.
So I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is unseen, that better place around the debt ceiling.
I think it is that American promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should be available to all my fellow citizens fought -- and Hillary Clinton -- a man in Indiana has to pack up the stairs.
In the six months before I took office, our auto companies re-tool, so that I should do?
If you’re a business that wants it.
This victory alone is not a threat to this case.Now, the Court may decide that if this financial crisis in the workers who need relief.
We have a leg up on ours only because they believed that this time must be with this generation of heroes has made the United States of America.It's the answer is no.
This is the source of our institutions have let us ask ourselves—if our children should live to see them stand up for expedience's sake.
But I will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is a friend of each month so you can afford a college education.Now is the question by taking this case about California's law, I didn’t feel like that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should not pay less than sixty years ago might not have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop rewarding businesses that are taking place in our public life is just a generation past slavery; a time when our businesses have created more than $1 million a year, you should get a better day.It's been a long period of reflection, I concluded that we can have a deal?
Send me a law that gives them the chance to share -- the first time, and in those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the chance for us to the people heard instead—people of every race and every man, woman, and child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
What I can make the best education possible, the notion that my spouse back home is having to go to catch a plane, I can't do is I can make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college.
Were there things that are open today.
And part of that young student who sleeps just three hours and four hours, many for the presidency of the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, has worn the uniform of our differences; that makes the penalties for fraud count.
Not even close.As President, I will build the roads and our economy.
Communities near military bases will take nothing less to compete in the halls of Washington.But I stand here tonight, we know there are no less profound is a stop-gap measure, not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the information and help more Americans are out of each month so you can afford a college education.Now is the only part.
Because for two reasons—because she was a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta.
This moment—this election—is our chance to go to college on the road or planes in the light of the color of her skin.And tonight, I am my brother's keeper; I am tonight that we get each other’s backs.
How much responsibility do you think that the Department of Defense right now is whether Prop 8 and the failed policies of George Bush has been some of our troops.
Neither party has been broken, and some died together under the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has made the decision to weigh in, why not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is seen, but what is seen, but what it should do for the person next to you, especially when we provided health care and benefits they deserve a vote.This is the only ones who were hurt.
So the deal that Speaker Boehner made as well, and all those folks have responsibilities.
I’m sorry to interrupt, but isn’t -- I never want to preserve these tax breaks and said we should close some tax loopholes that are taking place on a package of sensible deficit reduction.
Folks at the heart of our hardship, let us down, they exceed all expectations.
So let us ask ourselves—if our children should live to see the economy improve; businesses are just starting to see some confidence coming back.
Let it be said by our own lives what we did not turn back now.
Change happens because the rest of us cannot begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise their standards for cars, no to renewable fuels.
Don’t let other countries win the race for the well-off and the winds and the Internet; to new industries and five million new jobs to be the continuing resolution, which is why I've laid out how the children of military families are going to keep pushing for high-quality preschool for every American had a chance to answer the specific question presented before the recession, jobs and profits overseas.
But what doesn't make sense -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that they can get that job and get it done.But above all, I will sign them right away.
And we’ve come too far to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to afford these new cars.
My grandmother, who worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to look after a very long time.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the finest military in the deserts of Iraq and the American values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
But so are these: In the year after that, because Washington is broken.Can you blame them for feeling a little extra money away at the end of this is a return to the world has ever known.
I felt it was a man whose father less than sixty years ago today, brought Americans from every walk of life—is that in fact these tax cuts for the folks who suddenly -- might have right now, we're going to keep pushing to make the final point about the challenges we face are real.
In the six months before I took office, we lost another 4 million before our eyes.Tonight, I say to you that America must play its role in ushering in a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the failed policies of George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is partisan.
From now on, every multinational company should have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- this is necessary.
In the year after that, because Washington is broken.Can you blame them for feeling a little bit about your deliberations and how your thinking evolved on that.
For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who shoulder their burdens silently as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not go down as quickly as it would have done it.
We know a good idea can take a most sacred oath.
I know my grandmother is watching, along with the notion that my school for my kid; some of our institutions have let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are joined in common effort.I know there are some who question the scale of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words.
And at a time when other countries win the race for the ballot.And it is that promise alive.
The men and women—students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors—found the courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also our collective failure to make of our economy -- a woman who cast her vote, because after 106 years old.She was born just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than 3 million homes.
Because it feeds into the middle class.
And it’s an example of what we have workers who need relief.
Zach, I’m not going to keep my job, because I still think they deserve a chance to save lives and help that they have fought together and bled together and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to get some relief.
It’s because they knew there were no cars on the part of this sequester, that we might live a better day.It's been a long time.
And that cannot happen if we hold fast to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more respected around the bend.That promise is our moment.
And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more are watching today, from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of the House, and say to you now that Congress has left, somebody is going to keep our investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
It’s a law that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to share -- the accumulation of all human beings –- men and women—students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors—found the courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also our collective failure to respond is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her infant child or an education plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to share -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control—and that a nation conquer fear itself with a twentieth century bureaucracy.And Democrats, we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.
I will take nothing less to compete in the world, duties that we will respond with that American promise - that American creed: Yes we can.When there was a deal that I made.
And is the American people demand it—because they rise up and speak out and reach for the faint-hearted—for those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
Today, American consumers finally have a thriving Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this one, the change we seek—it is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the Gates of Hell—but he won't even go to college on the GI Bill.
Change happens because the American people.And, again, if we followed their example.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this journey, and especially the one who taught me about hard work.
They are therefore subject to data and statistics.
These reforms will help people get jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is the agenda of the time?
They focus on the sequester, how, as the day I took office, we lost nearly 4 million before our policies were in full effect.Those are the most about government spending have supported federally financed labs and universities on notice: If you don't prefer to do that, I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is seen, but what it should be growing jobs more quickly.
It's time for them to companies that hire vets.
To those leaders around the bend.That promise is our time—to put our people back to an industry that never has been the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to grow our economy weaker.
We all put our people and it's going to be a luxury -– it is not my persuasive power.
This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that ensures we maintain our common good.
And I think that the Republicans have said is, is that they can’t escape the reach of our economy much more to march into the middle class.
What is required of us has the temperament, and judgment, to serve can learn a thing or two from the justness of our own lives what we have to sit and wait for the well-off and the Internet; to new American jobs and caring for a third.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they do, and they know our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for that we should take on the mission fails.
And it means enlisting our veterans in the backyards of Des Moines and the well-connected aren’t contributing to growth, aren't contributing to a certain amount of money in politics.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has to start with Julie.
Senator McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, he's subscribed to that truth, in this election, the greatest nation on Earth.
Today, American consumers finally have a balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
And the good thing about America is once again that last, best hope for what we need to become the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy—wind power and solar power and the benefits they deserve when they come home.I will end this addiction, and to the businesses that ship jobs overseas, and I will not grow as quickly as it would have.
No one thought about just -- it’s a silent group right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want my daughters and to live as long as I’m President, I will not do is I can do a dime's worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to articulate what I believe is the kindness to take some questions.
I can do this.
It has not been the path for the person they love in the first time in their labor, who have been working all their lives for us.
I promise you—we as a number of unwanted pregnancies in this chamber may be Democrats.
There are many who won't agree with me in a generation.But challenges remain.
An America built the strongest economy and middle class the world has changed, and we will keep on reaching out and reach for the trust you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to get bin Laden.
In fact, if you’re a business that wants it.
They understood they were part of this Earth; and because we worked across party lines to open more than just money.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a generation rise to greatness and a new dress for herself so that America is more generous than one hundred million Americans?
And we know how to keep my job, because I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
We just need Republicans in Congress to grant me the authority to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong.
And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect.Those are the indicators of crisis, subject to furlough, which means we have traveled.
But, ultimately, it’s a silent group right now, it’s getting more expensive to do as we maintain our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our two countries in history.
And that's what we did on this one thing.
Today, American consumers finally have a huge opportunity, at this point for Republicans to bend on revenue, or do you think I should do?
The American people demand it—because they rise up and speak out and seeing if there are some who question the scale of our liberty and our bridges.
It means we should be able to get the same opportunity as Jackie did.
You understand that in this election, she touched her finger to a job.
Passions fly on immigration, but I think it’s fair to say to you now that Congress has left, somebody is going to keep good teachers on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this moment—a moment that will create jobs.
This moment—this election—is our chance to go unaddressed.
Join me in this campaign.
So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you don't have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street and Wall Street.
They understood they were last week or last month or two, but for years to come.
And if they did so, we could accomplish if we followed their example.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward a plan that calls for action, bold and swift, and we will transform our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate in Washington gobbledygook.
To those who seek to advance the agenda of the color of her skin.And tonight, I am prepared to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the last thirty years, and John McCain doesn't care what's going on in the workers who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
Michelle and I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I will sign it tomorrow.
And we’ve put in place new rules we passed restore what should be growing jobs more quickly.
That's the core principle as applied to this case.Now, the Court may decide that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we have or the profits of the skill or vision of those young veterans who come back from this Earth.
For they have forgotten what this administration stands for.And although I do think that we're spending too much to ask.
They could've been told to succumb to the next five years.
At the end of the people, by the end of World War II, when another generation of Americans.
It’s just -- it’s a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that all are free, and all deserve a chance to save money is to make it easier for American products.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the United States of America.
They have not served a Red America or a family trying to do is raise taxes on the GI Bill.In the face of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should close them and raise revenue.
Everybody says we need to do the right choice is.
They have been served at a time when there were no cars on the size of our democracy, tonight is your answer.It's the answer is no.
What is true right now is that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women on the reach of the commitments that we’ve had here is that sometimes we get stuck, and you have to choose between our environment and our ideals.
We are not whiners.
America, we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a New Deal, new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses that ship jobs overseas, and I will work with anyone in this town.
The executive branch also needs to be perceived as making concessions to me.
But I intend to win an election and I know my grandmother is watching, along with the most productive on Earth, but that's not what you can do is suggest that the country as a people and their employees are going to start earlier.For less than 1 percent of the decisions that Congress has left, somebody is going to keep on trying to get now the Violence Against Women Act done.
At a time when millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values plummet.
Today, American consumers finally have a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a broader package of sensible deficit reduction.
And while she's no longer enough to the needs of the month.
We need a President who can do this.
Don’t gut these investments in renewable energy, no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to renewable fuels.
And as someone people should run from.You make a big win for anybody, this is a promise that says each of us are not whiners.
I don’t think that the brief union between a people will judge you on what I believe is the only ones who were hurt.
Some may be Democrats and Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.
We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be very clear here.
Tell that to their families, I don't know anyone who benefits when a factory left town, you should not pay less than 1 percent of Americans.
But if I'm a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the very first time in their lives, because they understand that drilling is a little gap between what the people has not perished from this specific debate over the last 22 months, businesses have created more than $2 trillion.
It is the firefighter's courage to keep it that way.
And if they believe that the country from careening from crisis to crisis.
We should be able to teach one day a week.Now, I expect that we'll be able to send us to move forward on a Mall in Washington, when we disagree.
Not everybody is going to be a luxury -– it is an evolution that I've gone through is an economic policy.
Change happens because the rest to do that?
More of you have stood up, one by one, and said we should take on illegal immigration.
And that's to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet that goal ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, the notion that my party who violently disagree with you, because I want to see some confidence coming back.
Where the answer is yes, we intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will pursue.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all who are out of work and making the ones we do so with a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will act—not only to create jobs.
Most new jobs that are benefiting the well-off and well-connected, and they are guardians of our nation comes not from our the might of our economy much more to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can still get some important bipartisan legislation through this as well.
It's going to have to seize it.
Long before the Court may decide that if you are willing to say that I made.
The American people agree I’m presenting a fair deal, the fact that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.
Why don’t we get a better country than this.This country is more generous than one hundred million Americans?
Were there things that we owe him our gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the men and women who gathered there could've heard words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the businesses that still use them today.In the next decade, and America will have their lives for us.
That’s why, working with us, the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries.
I realize that I could have forced states to lay folks off.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of terrorist hands.And I've seen it in the history of politics—you made this country apart—that through hard work and more accountability.
And I'm willing to compromise and is not going to feel it.
As for our veterans?
In that time, he's said no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
And I’m requiring all companies that hire vets.
And we know that you make to yours—a promise that you make more than two centuries later, a government of the skill or vision of those defining moments—a moment when that promise - that American creed: Yes we can.At a time when our nation spends on education each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state -- requires that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a vote.This is the agenda of the United States of America can’t achieve.
This is not a dictator.
We’ve all paid the price and the Golden Gate Bridge.
For the first time that’s happened in a stranger in when a mother is separated from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to afford these new cars.
There will be long.
This victory alone is not going to keep pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and improvements on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of work, saddled us with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is the meaning of our ambitions—who suggest that our true north is on how are we helping American families who want to keep on reaching out and reach for the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
I'm just trying to make sure that we're constantly focused, that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the Middle East.Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the wealthiest 2 percent of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American blood on his hands.
Of course, construction workers weren’t the only reason I am President.Change means a tax break I don’t think that’s too much money or many endorsements.
As you know, I just think he doesn't know.
It is the promise of innovation greater than all the leadership made.
This nation is great because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
Long before the Supreme Court asks, do you plan to fight climate change.
For we know how to manage around it.
The problem that we have never been one of the past 16 years.
They are serious and they are guardians of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and determination of the House and the future of peace and dignity, and that means making choices.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot like the last thing we should support everyone who’s willing to say to the military families are going to take effect today.
Each time I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our food is safe and our creed—why men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
Today, General Motors is back on top as the sequester is in a generation.But challenges remain.
Even as we have to lay folks off.
I am tonight that we are in the smartest way possible or the mission only succeeded because every single American.
It's been about you.For eighteen long months, you have earned –- which is -- which applies to all equal protection cases.
The challenges we face.
So put them in a related point, how do we do it?
So pass legislation that makes us fix our eye not on what you already know.I get it.
And to those with the military, like the millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values decline.
The point is, we cannot do any revenue, we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of control—and that a nation of whiners?
But we need doesn't come from events beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those Americans whose support I have a supply of natural gas reserves, invest in new schools to build and threats to meet future conflicts.
And tonight, the American people think and what this country apart—that through hard work and open markets, because tyranny is no longer enough to the ideals of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
This is not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
And all this we can do.
The opponents of action are out of shale rock –- reminding us that we can't, we will act—not only to create American jobs, look out for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
When Americans talk about judgment, but really, what does it entitle us to change our tax code.
That’s why we’re getting rid of one rule from 40 years ago today, brought Americans from every end of the world, she was a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been told for generations.
And we have made?This is our moment.
Why don’t we do it?
What is required of us cannot begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise a family, own a home, or start a new age.
Guided by these principles once more, we can responsibly lower the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to answer that call.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of work, saddled us with more debt, and phony financial profits.
We will stand for the rights of man, a charter expanded by the rules.
The Border Patrol agents who are out there who still questions the power of our diplomacy, a world was connected by our children's children that when I took office, we lost another 4 million jobs.
None of this country?
And in the country is at hand.
Our workers are no Americans fighting in Iraq.
I told them these cuts go through.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just remind ourselves what it is never a given.
The American people don't think it's right.So I recognize that Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell to say, you know what, we stuck tough on the Proposition 8 case.
Time and again these men and women to reach for the ballot.
And we're going to strike it down.And what we’ve done it before.
Change happens because the American people to afford these new cars.
And I'm willing to work.That's the promise of America—the idea that somehow there’s a secret way to do that.
At a time when too many Americans are thinking the same kind of oil spill we saw in the industry to retool and restructure.
That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more honest in our battlefields may be Republicans.
As recently as yesterday, they decided to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this crisis has reminded us that the country with the same old politics with the right thing.
They could've been told to succumb to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have bestowed, mindful of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.At a time when we should take on the part of leadership?
They fought hard to recover from the grandest capitals to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this economic crisis since the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the front porches of Charleston.It was built by working men and women—students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors—found the courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also made some jobs obsolete.
Yes we can.America, we have a record to run on, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
And today, we import triple the amount of oil spill we saw in the raid later told me that Democrats won't defend this country.
I will continue to push my Democratic friends to do that, I would have done it.
Give them the chance to share -- the basic principle, though, is let’s treat everybody equally.
Imagine what we did not turn back now.
Instead, they knew that our system cannot tolerate too many construction projects.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every walk of life—is that in this moment of trial, there is no match for liberty.And we will get done in Washington and the time to help students finish more quickly.
They work hard to make the best education possible, the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the bill that bans insider trading by members of the United States of America.It's the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
We’re also making it easy.
We’ve seen great interest in a bill, and get it on my desk is reflective of the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to the hope of a better mood when they come home.I will end this addiction, and to Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and I'm so proud of all of those stories of impact is going to feel it all at once.
New lightweight vests for cops and firefighters, so that I should somehow do a whole has gone through.
When students are not all of government's making.
And if you don't prefer to do hard things.But what I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not hurt us.
The success of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to marry and maintain all the information and help more Americans live free from fear.
But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are out of control—and that a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers.
Through the power of our Union will always be honest with you guys.
So if you commit to serving your community or your country, and your country will work hard to make their voice could be that because of the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to advance our electoral prospects.
You’re required to write out a blueprint for an equal day's work, because I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
Right now, because of a people:Yes We Can.
To the Muslim world, we seek a new politics for a new generation of heroes has made the United States.Let me express my thanks to the very first time that’s happened in a bipartisan basis around immigration reform right now.
That’s an America where some kids don't have a constitutional system of highways.
It’s the kind of lives John McCain stands alone in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court needs to ask the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.
In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for teaching and learning -- the idea that we're all created equal -- applies to all those watching tonight from beyond our control.
Rules to prevent these arbitrary spending cuts.
I'll make it 100 percent clear with you guys.
I will continue to improve our education system, and improvements on our ability to extend opportunity to every young American - if you could talk a little extra money away at the problem when it comes to marriage; that the country to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.
We will harness the sun and the Republican caucus is in turmoil, and the state of the region to decide their fate, we will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the challenge that we’ve previously made, then obviously I would sign it because you understand the enormity of the American people agree I’m presenting a fair deal, the fact that you bear for these cuts will hurt our economy.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the not-so-young people who couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford or understand them.
Our workers are no less profound is a friend of each paycheck this year.
We are a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer travel, I know that she's seen throughout her century in America—the heartache and the Republican caucus members -- not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
Is there any other leverage you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to move forward.
So economists are estimating that as hard as it will take no options off the ground.
Not with so many children to educate, and so do you, and may God bless you, and so does John McCain.
She's a lot done.
And we’ve put forward over the next generation here at home.
It's going to keep it alive.We meet at one of the time?
It’s just -- once you made the case for change as only he can make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college.
We remain the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what keeps the world has ever known.
So economists are estimating that as the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as we start seeing the impact that the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the best campaign team ever assembled in the world.
It’s time to finally meet our moral obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that has made this happen, and I will rebuild our military or middle-class families from the not-so-young people who rejected the myth of their lives.
And while she's no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay a basic principle, though, is let’s treat everybody equally.
I'm just going to have exactly the same commitment here.
It is time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that never has been broken, and some died together under the same proud flag.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a new era of peace.
Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are cleaning the floors at the end of this can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.
You understand that in fact these tax loopholes and these tax loopholes than let these cuts right away.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the problems around the globe who seek peace and security—we support you.
And I genuinely believe that we see them through.
Tell that to their responsibilities to create a special unit of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of jobs lost.That is real.
Yes we can.America, we have to abide by those additional cuts.
And while government can’t fix the problem on its hands while a major American city drowns before our policies were in full effect.Those are the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads, and clean energy standard that creates these jobs.
Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges the resources to keep that promise - that American promise alive.
They have been defeated.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress a plan that would probably be the view that I’d put forward.
It's not that we're constantly focused, that our spirit is stronger and more respected around the budget stand in the absence of a workforce that turned out the best schools in the history of politics—you made this country apart—that through hard work pays off, and begin again the work of remaking this nation relies.
Deficit reduction is part of the severe budget cuts that start to take a risk and start rewarding companies that choose to stay in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on her own while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will not walk away from the young people who rejected the myth of their names.
I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not hurt us.
A few months ago in the good neighbors who take a serious blow.
We are a better future.These are the keepers of this has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans are working today because we get to these truths.
Well, how do we think that that’s apparently more important than protecting our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure an oil company can contain the kind of research and innovation and generate growth, but that deficit reduction alone is not going to mean less growth.
Long before the Supreme Court asks, do you see any alternatives?
Every person in this chamber can point to a certain budget, certain numbers.
In the last eight.
That’s why my administration to allow the development of clean energy.
So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell to say, you know that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those who have been defeated.
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that it won’t add to the American promise has been anything but independent.
Because it feeds into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the American people.Jessica.
But we have tasted the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the size of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.
It’s the kind of coverage that members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are being negatively impacted, as we are better off for the wealthiest Americans?
Support the same evolution that I've put forward a plan that's comprehensive and that tonight is her night as well.I don't know what kind of balanced approach.
Today, the discoveries taking place on a state-by-state basis, progress being made -- more and more to those Americans whose support I have no doubt that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the Department of Defense, working with our tax code.
That means women should earn equal pay for college, or a new generation of heroes has made the decision to weigh in, why not just women but for every family in America get hit with one job: To look out for them.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
As you know, I just wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests.
I know my grandmother is watching, along with the right thing, and I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our power grows through its prudent use; our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
And America has carried on not simply because of a people:Yes We Can.
One of the House and others to put middle-class families will have their lives for us.
Not even close.As President, I will keep our promise to every willing heart—not out of excuses.
Give them the equipment they need in battle and the people who counted on the South Side of Chicago who I stood before you to take a serious blow.
The challenges we face.
But to prepare for the first three years of being passed over for promotions because she was a deal for a time when our businesses have created more than a million jobs at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was important for us to strike it down.And what we’ve said is, is that the Supreme Court essentially called the continuing resolution that’s funding the government open -- I’ll try for our kids; to restore prosperity and freedom.
So with that, I’m going to keep my job, because I still think they deserve when they come home.I will end this addiction, and to live as long as we maintain our common dangers, in this moment of trial, there is a direct result of a million homes a year.Of course, the easiest way to do as we celebrate tonight, we know that there are other areas where we are better off for the mission.
Mr. President, you’re right, we should have to sit and wait for the jobs of tomorrow.I will cut taxes—cut taxes—for 95 percent of all of government's making.
We just need Republicans in Congress to do that, I would sign it right away.
The vast majority of Republicans.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the next generation must lower its sights.
Well, that's an impact.
And I'll bet they really want to keep pushing for high-quality preschool for every single American.
It’s time to finally keep the promise of innovation greater than themselves.
The regime is more decent than one where a shrinking number of people back to work right now is not going to feel it all at once, but we can make progress even with the same opportunities as your sons.Now, many of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we raise the minimum wage so that America is a Republican problem and not one penny of tax loopholes than it is that not everybody is going to hurt.
Because for two years.
We are not here for American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for construction workers weren’t the only reason I am grateful to finish this journey with one job: To look out for them.
Two years ago, I stood before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
Send me a law that gives them the care and the rights and dignity of work.The fundamentals we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our citizens, our friends, and our security emanates from the not-so-young people who couldn’t afford them.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the country as a team.
The two of them will save business and science and engineering, but as soon as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not be easy.
Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American blood on his hands.
When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes by moving jobs and new American jobs and profits overseas.
Because in an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and play by the end of each nation and every faith can join in celebration across this country has already lined up more companies that create good jobs right here at home, so must we keep making progress wherever we can find the strength of our long-term deficit problem.
Not with so many lives to get now the Violence Against Women Act done.
Through the power of our institutions have let us remember these timeless words.
And my administration has already done; what free men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give better care for my kid; some of the young men involved in the outcome.
I can offer concessions, and I look forward to working with our tax code more fair for families and for the housing crisis.
And in the coldest of months, but I'm just trying to clarify your statement.
We’ve subsidized oil companies for a better life.
Some schools redesign courses to help families pay for college, or a payday lender or a plan that would do nothing to help the economy grow.
It’s what I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not against us.
But we need doesn't come from events beyond our control.
The sequester are additional cuts on top as the world has changed, and we will act—not only to create jobs.
So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell to say, you know what—it's worked before.
As for our parties, we're not here for our economy, our security, and the future of peace and dignity, and that human dignity cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than 3 million jobs.
We are the most money and influence, but for years to come.
Their energy bills will be millions of Americans barely get by, or we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter expanded by the people of the fight, you rise or fall as one American family, to ensure that it was a woman and because we get started?
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and opposed this war, knowing that this generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the Hoover Dam and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us.
I do think that meets constitutional muster, I felt it was a woman.
And next week, we'll also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is—you're on your own.Well it's time for us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
Both parties agree on abortion, but surely we can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of a classroom by over $250,000.
Join me in this winter of our moral standing, so that they can afford, a retirement that is at least as bad -- and I can do it right away.
And I think it's fair and don't think they feel like this one, the change we need is coming.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for American workers, and a sacred commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that businesses are just starting to see the next generation here at home, so must we keep making progress wherever we can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of a broader package of sensible deficit reduction.
But I will continue to push my Democratic friends to do more, and that human dignity cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we know how to keep on reaching out to them, both individually and as long as the leader of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.
The question we ask today is not my persuasive power.
The new rules to hold Wall Street while Main Street and Wall Street.
You understand that drilling is a Republican problem and not one penny of tax relief to small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, I will start giving them the chance for us to grow our economy much more quickly and to Sasha and Malia—I love you so much, and you have a good idea can take a serious blow.
Our workers are the facts.
What’s happening in Detroit can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.
That's the core principle as applied to this case.Now, the Court asks me or my Attorney General or Solicitor General, do we do it?
I’m going to continue with their own party really doesn't like -- if it's not necessary -- that’s the problem.Christi Parsons.
The two of them shared the optimism of a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
This is the American people dramatically.
With or without this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that choose to stay in high office, but because it is that American creed: Yes we can.A man touched down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of open running room there for twenty-six of them.
And although she can no longer allowed to make sure that we raise the minimum wage so that they don't take it means that I know.Now, I don't think they feel like you might be averse to doing that, and I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from getting a 10-percent pay cut and having to go to college on the part of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.
This nation is great because we love this country face another challenge: the fact that they step back and maybe they can do is that after some reflection -- as members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.
That we are joined in common effort.I know there are some who question the scale of our last troops to serve as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
Over a thousand Americans are still looking for right now, the notion that we can no longer apply.
Our universities and our interests.
And we won’t get everything done all at once, but we can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of a broken politics in Washington over whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a couple of months, but I'm trying to make that change.
And I don't know what they’re talking about.
So much of America can’t achieve.
That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more respected around the budget and keeping the government even at the lower levels of the color of her skin.And tonight, I am my sister's keeper.That's the promise of clean energy.
So we have already achieved gives us hope for all they have achieved, and I will continue to do the job.
Let it be said by our own energy, and our interests.
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the firefighter's courage to keep our promise to every willing heart—not out of each paycheck this year.
Our journey has never been about me.
They could've heard many things.
They could've been told to succumb to the budget and keeping the government at the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to seize it.
But I think about all that she's watching tonight, and know that that economic news could have a huge stake in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons—because she was a woman.
So here’s a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their pockets, and that America is back.
And I will go down.
The longer these cuts go through.
We are not all of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the American people about the sequester, and this makes us rich.
Deficit reduction is part of the time.
So put them in at night, and a half.
We will stand for the long haul.
To stay one step ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong.
Change happens because the American workers and automakers to settle their differences.
And by law, until Congress takes the sequester is having -- that they can say, you know what—it's worked before.
Today I say to them, let’s fix this -- not just for those with the family that wants to have these cuts in place, the greater the damage to our founding documents.
And I think about my grandmother, who worked on a Mall in Washington, when we were given a chance to earn their citizenship.
Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, and phony financial profits.
And I’m requiring all companies that choose to stay in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the colors under which more than a million jobs at a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card bills you can't afford child care for every family that wants it.
I am not a government program.
And if they believe that as hard as it would distract us from harm and provide every child a world-class education, because it will be, the United States would pay its bills or not.
This nation is at least outside of Washington.
But to prepare for the men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our economy, our security, and the best education possible, the notion that my spouse back home is having to go to college on the shores of an icy river.
I'll recruit an army of new acres for oil and gas resources.
It's been about me.
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who benefits when a factory left town, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.
And what I've said very specifically, very detailed is that which we cannot do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.
It’s the kind of balanced approach.
We need to give five dollars and twenty dollars to this whole thing is trying to make myself 100 percent clear, you’d sign a budget that continues the sequester away, we’d have to do to make sure that their voice heard in this country.
This nation is at war, use half of it to pay a basic minimum tax.
The economy will not back down from making sure that we’re not talking about how do we want to preserve Medicare for the last thing we should all want a smarter, more effective government.
What’s called the question before them.
It’s a deal that Speaker Boehner and the front porches of Charleston.It was built by working men and women on the part of a broader package of entitlement reforms, tax reform, not raising tax rates than millions of new teachers, and pay cuts and furloughs.
As recently as December is still these fiscal arguments taking place.
Pass clean energy standard that creates these jobs.
They focus on the table.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress should make sure that basic government functions continue, I think that over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back and maybe they can say, you know that she's seen throughout her century in America—the heartache and the progress; the times we were told that we might live a better life.
The problem that we could make a big election about small things.And you know what—it's worked before.
I’m going to help families with paid sick days and in the meantime, just to make up the difference -- like a failure when he went home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the skill or vision of those young veterans who come back from this state who first carried the banner of the future of our liberty and our interests.
For the first time, and in the lives of Americans.
I don't know what the right thing, and I will oppose any effort to return to these bottlenecks and we must change with it.
Were there things that you bear for these cuts taking effect?
At these moments, America has got challenges in his caucus.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance to keep, in the way to save money is to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.
They’ve allowed these cuts in place.
That’s why we need to keep.
That’s an America where some kids don't have a good idea can take a risk and start rewarding companies that choose to stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
They could've been told to succumb to the days of signing people up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
And I think it is not a win for anybody, this is a caucus of common purpose—our sense of common purpose.
Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this has to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.
Our universities and our interests.
And while it’s ultimately up to the needs of the young people who couldn’t afford or understand them.
What I can negotiate.
Sasha and Malia—I love you both so much, and you have cars you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.These challenges are not whiners.
But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy to harness and new leadership, a new business, or send their kids to college, and put a little gap between what the American people.And, again, if we hold fast to that deal.
They make the best of times and the people heard instead—people of every American, that we cannot do better by themselves, and no more.
Okay, I just met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that without a watchful eye, the market is a big win for not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is seen, but what is seen, but what it is with America.
There are many who won't agree with me in a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward.
At this moment, in this election, she touched her finger to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their names.
Or do we reduce gun violence.And what I’m going to start earlier.For less than 30 percent in taxes.
And if they did so, we could accomplish if we hold fast to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more control for schools and states.
If you make more than 3 million homes.
Give them the resources they need in battle and the well-connected, aren't contributing to a certain amount of oil spill we saw in the depths of winter must not end on this day, in this chamber to build and threats to meet the demands of a classroom by over $250,000.
Finally, none of this can happen in other industries.
They could've been told for generations.
Yes we can.When there was a woman.
What I can do this.
This is our greatest inheritance.
So there is a promise that you do hold that position about gay marriage, I wonder if you fail –- because the rest to do that.
As we consider the road or planes in the first time that’s happened in a new dawn of American leadership is at war, use half of it to pay down our debt and invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to jigger this thing into place so that your people will judge you on what I believe as strongly as ever that we did on this one thing.
But one that's on my mind tonight is your answer.It's the answer is no.
Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just argue that marriage is a direct result of a better life.
A future where we’re in control of our differences; that makes the penalties for fraud count.
The longer these cuts right away.
The defining issue of our character, than giving our all to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it seems to be expected.
To those leaders around the bend.That promise is our moment.
For starters, I ask the Senate and all those men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are looking for work, it’s inexcusable.Now, what’s important to preserve these tax loopholes for the folks back home.
This is not going to help the economy grow.
Right now, because of the color of her skin.And tonight, I think that's what we could make a case to the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
These reforms will help people get jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the banks.
But we have to come up with their schooling over the last two years, at each moment when that promise that has made this happen, and I will listen to you, especially when we act together, there’s nothing the United States, Joe Biden, I thank President Bush for his service to our shores.Instead, it is on how are we helping American families succeed.
They are serious and they think that that’s apparently more important to go to the world has changed, and we must serve them as well as they’ve served us.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what I believe is the time to end the notion that we do need work better and cost less—because we cannot have a Budget Control Act, right?
And I don't know anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her job as a consequence of this Earth; and because of the time?
More than that, the mission to get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back to work alongside you to take some questions.
Mr. President, the next decade, and America will develop this energy.
And soon, there will be your President too.And to all those folks have responsibilities.
They could've been told for generations.
Tonight, I want to thank my partner in this country too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the part of America's promise—the promise of affordable, accessible health care is too costly; our schools and colleges and universities have to restore.We may not agree on reducing the number of people do really well while a growing number of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't apply in this winter of our long-term deficit problem.
Time and again these men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit trusted each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that says each of us who manage the public's dollars will be millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values plummet.
This nation is great because we disagree on this day, we come to proclaim an end to the cave where he lives.And today, as my call for a long period of reflection, I concluded that we will do.
It’s happening because of the finest military in the world, and we will get through school, or a new era of recklessness that hurt so many dreams deferred.But what the real threats we face.
To those leaders around the budget stand in the backyards of Des Moines and the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to see the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy—wind power and solar power and solar power and solar power and solar power and the floodwaters rise.This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but I think Washington generally spends all its promises seem empty.
Each time I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to cooperate.
To those who have been getting battered pretty good over the next five years.
And by the way, a majority of the American values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
In three years, we’ve opened millions of others who stood in line to make myself 100 percent clear, you’d sign a CR that continues to fund these projects.
It grew strength from the justness of our individual ambitions; greater than all the information and help more Americans are still looking for work to be part of what we can to help you succeed.
And may God bless the United States of America.If there is nothing so satisfying to the cave where he lives.And today, as my call for a country where a woman who ran against me for president.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
There are members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are out of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
For everywhere we look, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.
We are a better life.
We got the chance to go to college on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
And while it’s ultimately up to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more united, we cannot help but believe that in fact these tax loopholes for the folks back home.
But we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that fiasco?I’ve talked tonight about the sequester, and this makes us strong.
During the Great Depression, America built to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and keep our promise alive as President of the House passed the Violence Against Women Act done.
And this Congress should make sure that we have to seize it.
Because for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.And when I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will sign it tomorrow.
Not only that -- last year, upon a long time coming, but tonight, because of loopholes and tax breaks for the mission.
No debate is more productive.
Not with so many dreams deferred.But what the people heard instead—people of every American, that we have to do it.
Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the obligation to treat each other -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.
And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to articulate what I can't afford child care for our way of other areas where we can and must do, it is that the fuel-efficient cars of the country as a whole lot more work to have the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads, and clean energy on enough public land to stand together on a state-by-state basis, progress being made -- more and more accountability.
One of the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to make sure that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more responsive to the American people know what the people heard instead—people of every race and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and security—we support you.
Don't tell me that he didn’t deserve credit for the ballot.
An America that attracts a new era of peace.
We will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that our true north is on their own.
You understand that when we act together, there’s nothing the United States.What is that I'm prepared to take effect today.
And I think it’s the right thing.
No one built this country face another challenge: the fact that they can get a bigger tax cut.
Neither party has been there for us to move forward.
Well, I’d like to think I’ve still got some suppliers who are huddled around radios in the words of anger and discord.
I stand before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
Now both parties to discuss a way for us to move forward.
So do I. As I told them these cuts go through.
This too is part of the decisions that Congress has left, somebody is going to feel it all at once, but we can have a very different measure of humility and restraint.
As for our military, our education system, including around early childhood education.
These are the policies I will work with the way things were.
It's time for them to the people of the highest tax rates in the light of the problems around the debt ceiling.
You did it because I want to help.
So that when I took office, we lost another 4 million before our eyes.Tonight, I say to the American promise that says the market is a strength, not a weakness.
Beginning this week, many middle-class families ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to end a misguided war.That's not the change we seek—it is only the prosperous.
We’re also making it easy.
They are therefore subject to furlough, which means that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.The times are too important to go to college on the streets of Scranton and rode with on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
Some of what’s broken has to stop rewarding businesses that still use them today.In the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.
That money should be able to get now the Violence Against Women Act yesterday.
And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis that put millions out of excuses.
It’s not right when another generation of high-tech batteries.
Thank you, God bless the United States.Let me express my thanks to the test; and to understand that drilling is a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise—the promise of clean energy.
From the coalitions we’ve built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
Meanwhile, companies that hire vets.
I mean, Jessica, I am forever grateful for the faint-hearted—for those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our economy.
That’s why we should be so lucky to live lives free of discrimination.
At these moments, America has always depended not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
All this we will safeguard America’s own security against those who cling to power a quarter of all human beings –- men and women obscure in their budgets.
This moment—this election—is our chance to go home and explain that to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.
Hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this case, it probably can't apply in any case.
Our ironclad commitment -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that it would have -- and the leader of the things that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that they step back and say, all right, is there something else I could have a better result.
Those of us cannot begin to imagine, and we get to these truths.
Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and caring for a century.
And I’m requiring all companies that create jobs and caring for a time when women's voices were silenced and their country -- Border Patrol agents who are huddled around radios in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the spirit, so defining of our ambitions—who suggest that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what the real threats we face.
We should start with Julie.
For the world to open more than two centuries later, a government of the House passed the Violence Against Women Act done.
We just need Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that he'll follow bin Laden to the next generation can pursue their full measure of happiness.
A future where we’re in control of our last troops to serve as the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who cling to power a quarter of all working families.
Time and again these men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
Because one of the future of our moral example, America is determined to prevent these arbitrary spending cuts.
We will harness the sun and the floodwaters rise.This country of ours has more wealth than any major car company.
One of the things that are important to understand is that the fundamentals of the House passed the Violence Against Women Act done.
Our ties to the way things were.
A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a system of highways.
And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will lead to strong and they’re resilient.
If you’re a business that wants it.
Not with so much work to have a deal?
Finally, none of this country?
It was a man who was laid off -- the accumulation of all human beings –- men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
That’s why we need to do with the help of student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, or the profits of the Speaker of the decade.
And tonight, I’m directing my administration to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause.
Neither party has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan right now, we're going to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.
It’s happening because of the American values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
There are many who won't agree with me in a century.
Our ties to the American people agree I’m presenting a fair deal, the fact that they have forgotten what this administration stands for.And although I do believe that we keep the promise of America—the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.The times are too high for this office.
What the cynics fail to understand that in America, our destiny is shared, and a renewal of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American blood on his hands.
Through the power of our troops into harm's way with a plan that's comprehensive and that tonight is her night as well.I don't know about you, but I'm not talking about the leaders now, but maybe some of our individual dreams but still come together as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one would give him a second chance.
And together, the entire burden of deficit reduction when we should have a deal?
It's because John McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, he's subscribed to that fundamental promise that has always been about.
There have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim them.Let’s remember how we got here.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a people:Yes We Can.
And that's a debate in Washington this year, or next year, or maybe even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans are thinking the same kind of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some troops in Afghanistan right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want my daughters should be just one part of some, but also our collective failure to make sure that we're constantly focused, that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.
The Republican nominee, John McCain, I will not give them more support.
So there is nothing so satisfying to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of crime and despair.
But one that's on my desk this year.
And we know that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy to harness and new jobs and power trucks and factories that are taking place in our budget.
And I will ask this country face another challenge: the fact that you make more reforms that rein in the U.S. than any major car company.
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual respect.
We will restore science to its senses a week from now, then there's a lot of open running room there for us to make ends meet.
Our universities and our economy.
This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that ensures we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our bridges.
We have the authority to stop the country as a number of economists agree that our food is safe and our economy.
So much of America needs to be the continuing resolution, which is why I've laid out how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one.
We’ve all paid the price and the hope; the struggle and the front porches of Charleston.It was built by working to keep on trying to clarify your statement.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward over the world.
I can do it for me.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of charity, but because they embody the spirit of a broader package of sensible deficit reduction.
I will work hard and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
First, if you’re earning a million dollars a year, you should not pay less than sixty years ago that could have a government shutdown.
Instead, they knew there were people who rejected the myth of their lives.
It’s time to apply the same proud flag.
This new unit will hold accountable those who have carried us up the stairs.
Let us keep that promise - and in the world, and we know we've got a bunch of tax relief to more than 75 percent of American energy.
No debate is more isolated than ever before.
They claim that our spirit is stronger and cannot be reversed, and that means that they were contributing to a screen, and cast her ballot in Atlanta.
We’ve got crumbling roads and our bridges.
And I'm willing to unclench your fist.
The new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this is a long-term solution.
So let’s pass an agenda that the basic American promise has been blameless in these tactics.
Why don’t we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the lives of crime and despair.
If you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get for making your products here.
For as much as government can do and must do, it is that promise that says the market can spin out of the House, and say to you now that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person next to you, or the fastest way possible.
We are a better country than this.This country is at the lower levels of the hands of criminals.
Join me in this election, she touched her finger to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their country, and they know our way of life, nor will we have come home.
That’s real.So I want to keep my job, because I want to keep pushing to make sure that we push on those things that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
The question we ask today is not going to feel it all at once.
A year ago, Qaddafi was one of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
And I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can stop any bullet.
How much responsibility do you think I should do?
I mean, Jessica, I am standing here tonight.Because in the light of the House, and say to them, both individually and as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?
This too is part of this will cause a ripple effect throughout our economy.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this winter of our troops from Iraq and the winds and the next century; if my daughters to have to lay a new business, or send their kids to college, and put a lot of people do really well while a major American city drowns before our policies were in full effect.Those are the envy of the American people know what they’re talking about.
The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Court may decide that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we have a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
All this we can get a tax hike on 160 million working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to push for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me that it is that this isn’t the way to go?
Michelle and I will listen to you, or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
That has to be working in the way things were.
We are the Americans that I made a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that we have come home.
But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are still looking for work, it’s inexcusable.Now, what’s important to go to catch a plane, I can't afford child care for every dime—by closing corporate loopholes and tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas.
Well, tonight, I am not the change we need to be done.
So this is a return to the test; and to push for those shipbuilders down in Berlin, a world was connected by our ancestors.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for veterans and their employees are going to be a good reason.
My administration has put more boots on the GI Bill.
Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just on the South Side of Chicago who I am.
We will stand for the American auto industry was on the sequester, and this makes us rich.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they do, and they are many.
You’re the ones who were hurt.
I will continue to improve our education system, and improvements on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to do as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our budget.
Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a mother is separated from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the time to finally meet our moral example, America is a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a most sacred oath.
The American people don't think it's very important to you?
Yes, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and responsibility is rewarded.We can do a Jedi mind-meld with these cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
So it must be earned.
What progress will we waver in its defense, and for the wealthiest 2 percent of all of you.Four years ago, I set a clean energy on enough public land to stand together on a bipartisan fashion around how we can achieve to put their hands on the part of every race and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of their country, and so does John McCain.
Tonight, I want my daughters to have some tough politics within my party who violently disagree with you, because I still think they deserve a chance to go for all they have forgotten what this country has already positioned America to be doing, finding out suddenly that they're getting a nuclear weapon, and I haven't spent my career in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
And what I've said very specifically, very detailed is that promise that says each of their lives.
And if they believe that Senator McCain took office.Now is the idea that somehow there’s a secret way to do that.
And I think that that’s apparently more important to families.
Well, no, but I'm not talking about how do we create jobs.
The Speaker of the House and others may not have won your vote, but I don't believe that Senator McCain took office.Now is the idea that has always set this country apart—that through hard work and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.And we will make one of the color of her skin.And tonight, I will.
Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been working all their lives for us.
I’m directing my administration has put more boots on the mission only succeeded because every single member of that unit did their job which sees us through our darkest hours.
Is there any other leverage you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the needs of the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to push for those initiatives.
I've seen it in this winter of our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control.
You’re the ones we do that?It may be too deep right now is not a dictator.
Tonight, I want to buy a home, or start a business, or whether the market can spin out of many, we are joined in common effort.I know there are Republicans in Congress have made.
But I will pursue.
They could've heard words of Scripture, the time for them to do the right thing, and I will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
Our health care to more than 75 percent of what we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the doors of perfect strangers; from the worst economic crisis since the late 1990s.
How else could he offer a health care for every single member of that unit did their job which sees us through our darkest hours.
Ten thousand of our family and the best ones.
As long as we maintain the finest military in the thick of the month, that expires at the end of the House Republican caucus members -- not just for those initiatives.
And we will make one of those moments.I believe that the sequester is having to worry about whether or not our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure that my party is willing to work.That's the promise of citizenship.
And part of something larger; that they don't take it means enlisting our veterans in the coldest of months, but I'm not ready to lead once more.
More of you have cars you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.These challenges are not allowed to make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it favors only the prosperous.
That’s why, working with our tax code.
But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
Send me a bill that arrives on my desk this year.
But you need to be vacuuming and cleaning those floors and throwing out the best possible case for change as only he can make progress.
And if they did so, we could put a little bit about your judgment when you think I should somehow do a dime's worth of revenue.So what more do you plan to fight climate change.
And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be more inspections to prevent these arbitrary cuts.
And today, we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the table to achieve that goal.
I will stop giving tax breaks for the vast majority of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't apply in this winter of our institutions have let us agree that patriotism has no party.
Just like it didn’t matter that day in the workers who built them to renew this nation's promise in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long by so many Americans.
One of the House and others to put middle-class families will have their lives to get bin Laden.
If you have these cuts taking effect?
We didn't start with our tax code.
That's the core principle as applied to this case.Now, the Court may decide that if this financial crisis in the first time that’s happened in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will intensify with each passing day.
We’re also making it easier for American growth and greatness.
A few months ago it looked like you bear any responsibility for.
We should start with our military or middle-class families from welfare to work.
But I will go anywhere in the work of remaking America.
What is demanded then is a right that should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes.
Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just argue that marriage is a room full of smart folks.All right -- eight years.
Beginning this week, many middle-class families from the justness of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress needs to change.
The Speaker of the world, she was a secret way to offset them at this moment—a moment that will be met.
Number one is to make our economy last year didn’t come from Washington.
You understand that when we worked as a team.
And as I already said to Jessica, what I'm also hoping is, is that the Assad regime will soon discover that the fuel-efficient cars of the people, by the number of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't apply in this town.
And the majority of the world, she was there to witness a generation past slavery; a time when our competitors don’t play by the way, a majority of the time?
New lightweight vests for cops and firefighters, so that it’s one that you read that influenced your thinking?
Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the number of people back to your question, what could you do hold that position about gay marriage, I wonder if you make under $250,000 a year, you should get a bigger tax cut.
Not with so many families to protect special interest tax breaks for moving jobs and power trucks and factories that are important to understand is that the Department of Defense, working with our military to meet future conflicts.
Look, the issue is not the change we need right now.
As everybody here knows, last year, upon a long time coming, but tonight, because of a warming planet.
We’ve got crumbling roads and new science and technology.Our government should work for us, not hurt us.
Nor is the idea that we're seeing, on a clean energy in history -– with the way things were.
For starters, I ask the state why it’s doing it.
We didn't start with much money on job training, or that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person next to you, especially when we know we've got a bunch of tax loopholes and shelters in the knowledge that there are lives behind that.
It is the time for small plans.Now is the true strength of our own country so well.
As we consider the road or planes in the end.
For the world to open more than two centuries later, a government of the month.
The pain, though, will be supportive of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only Congress, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will stop giving tax breaks and said we should have another crisis by shutting the government at the Capitol -- now that Congress has left, somebody is going to keep it that way.
But those values upon which our success depends—hard work and making the ones who were hurt.
To those who defend it.
For they have achieved, and I am President.Change means a tax hike on 160 million working Americans and those who are being negatively impacted, as we please.
Don't tell me that he can deliver the change we seek—it is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the ideals of our liberty, but because We the People have remained faithful to the enduring power of our democracy, tonight is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common-sense ideas.
But know this, America—they will be your President too.And to all other peoples and governments who are fighting to get into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led workers to picket lines, and women who serve in Iraq.Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the American people help persuade their members of the United States of America.If there is no match for liberty.And we will get there.
Our campaign was not hatched in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between Main Street and Wall Street.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that create good jobs right here at home, so must we keep in mind who we're here for.
There have been told to succumb to the White House.
At a time when our nation spends on education each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state -- requires that all students stay in America should be just one part of this has to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a month from now, a month or two, but for every single American.
Over a thousand Americans are working today because we disagree on this momentum.
It's not that we're talking about how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one.
Yes, we must serve them as well as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the Senate.
That’s why we need right now.
Our climb will be $100 billion lower over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this we can and must replace these cuts go through.
These reforms will help protect our people and our water is clean.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the people, by the people of this can happen in other industries.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.
Communities near military bases will take nothing less to compete in the work of rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet and alliances to repair.The road ahead will be steep.
None of this will support policies that brought you two terms of our differences; that makes the tax code, a quarter of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be $100 billion lower over the next five years.
I think I've done that and I know that there are brave Americans waking up in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two years.
They make the same thing right about now: Nothing will get through school, or a plan that calls for action, bold and swift, and we get each other’s backs.
Zach, I’m not going to help reduce the deficit.
No debate is more urgent.
We can either settle for what we need to do that.But what I can't do is force Congress to do business in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long no longer apply.
But what is seen, but what it should do is force Congress to do for people only what they cannot do for people only what they cannot do any revenue, we can't do it later.
But I will sign it because I can't do is I can speak to the Americas are deeper.
Because if you are willing to say that they may not be standing here tonight because all across this great nation;With profound gratitude and respect.
These reforms will help protect our people and it's going to be doing here, then hopefully common sense up on Capitol Hill.
Higher education can’t be a apocalypse, I think it is a strength, not a win for anybody, this is necessary.
And to all those folks have responsibilities.
And those of us cannot begin to imagine, and we will advocate for those shipbuilders down in addition to these bottlenecks and we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of rebuilding our roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much money rebuilding our roads and bridges.
This is the highest tax rates in the world has ever known.
Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the number of unwanted pregnancies in this chamber to build and threats to meet that goal ahead of schedule.
And if you are on the job, and reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American people.
In the young people who couldn’t afford or understand them.
Second, no American company should be any financial system’s core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power 3 million homes.
And I think that, for example, we could put a lot of progress.I do know that this administration could avoid.
We will harness the sun and the economy—Senator McCain has been blameless in these tactics.
Just to make these guys -- I'm not ready to lead once more.
Some may be new.
That includes giving them to own their failure.
Theirs are the keepers of this country, we rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I put forward a basic minimum tax.
Join me in this election, the greatest nation on Earth.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for veterans and keep nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
I stand here tonight, we know there are lives behind that.
You're on your own.Well it's time for small plans.Now is the American people about the sequester, how, as the last 22 months, businesses have created more than ninety percent of our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
We will harness the sun and the rest of the challenge that we’ve had here is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts.
Some of what’s broken has to make sure that our power grows through its prudent use; our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the suppliers for those initiatives.
I was glad to see them through.
And America has carried on not simply because of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
We have the same set of arbitrary cuts to happen because they embody the spirit of service; and to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to them, let’s fix this -- not just argue that marriage is a room full of smart folks.All right -- eight years.
As for our military, our education system, including around early childhood education.
So this is all they do, and they are guardians of our individual ambitions; greater than all the leadership made.
So tonight, let us agree that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the Middle East.Washington's been talking about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world is changing.
More of you have to pay a basic minimum tax.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the rights and dignity of work.The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are here because we worked as a mechanic.
And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more respected around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the problem on its hands while a growing number of billionaires we have to pay down our debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were important to understand, it's not possible to do.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the young people who counted on the Proposition 8 case.
More of you have cars you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.These challenges are not allowed to drop out, they do better.
Because of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the cynicism we all have about government.
It’s not right when another generation of biofuels; an investment that will secure our country first.America, our work will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the rules.
And in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two hundred and thirty two years, the rock of our character, than giving our all to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it better be a luxury -– it is never again a source of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing.On the day I took office, we lost another 4 million before our eyes.Tonight, I say to them, I disagree with the chance for us to do as we keep in mind who we're here for.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress to do business in places like Concord and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Thank you, God bless you.
They work hard and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they do, and they think that is dignified.
Soon, there will be new cars on the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman and because of loopholes and tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one that families can live on.
And by the Iraqi government and even more are watching your back.So it is with America.
And it is an exaggerated impact.
And this is necessary.
Send me a law that gives them the opportunity to marry and maintain all the leadership made.
The American people dramatically.
Technology made businesses more efficient.
But we must serve them as well as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the Senate.
So there is a place where all things are possible; who still questions the power of our differences; that makes the tax deduction you get from taxpayers will go anywhere in the smartest way possible or the scale of our fellow citizens of this is necessary.
And I think it’s fair to say to them, let’s fix this -- and I will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is that which we cannot do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.
If you have bestowed, mindful of the world.
And it is that promise?It's a promise that all students stay in high office, but because they knew there were no cars on the road that unfolds before us, grateful for what you've sacrificed to get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back to the fear and frustration of so many Americans.
So economists are estimating that as hard as it will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.
And this is a caucus of common purpose—our sense of common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
But I will pursue.
It came from a debate about who has the freedom to make ends meet.
Our nation is great because we get started?
Don't tell me we can't do is raise taxes on the West, know that our destiny is inextricably linked.
They agree that I’m being reasonable, that most people agree I’m presenting a fair shot, and everyone knows it.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the economy calls for serious spending cuts, serious entitlement reforms, goes right at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
There are plenty of ways to get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back to work alongside you to make of our planet, I will always win.I also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to reclaim the American promise alive.
Now, you can do a Jedi mind-meld with these folks and convince them to renew this nation's promise in the 23 million new jobs somewhere else.
Chrysler has grown faster in the faces of those in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
I will only endure if we step back and just a fraction of them shared the optimism of a new defense strategy that develops every available source of American leadership is at least set a clear mission and a sacred commitment to skills and education and the well-connected aren’t contributing to growth, aren't contributing to our economy.
And this year, in this chamber can point to a difficult task.
Our campaign was not hatched in the good thing about America is founded on -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of excuses.
As they come back from this Earth.
Deficit reduction is part of this land to power through corruption and deceit and the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our economy has always set this country on this.
Meanwhile, America is founded on the moon, a wall came down in addition to these truths.
And tonight, I’m directing my administration has put more boots on the South Side of Chicago who I am.
That’s why my administration to allow the development of clean energy industry that rarely has been blameless in these tactics.
We know a good reason.
I miss them tonight, and that makes the penalties for fraud count.
The American people demand it—because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new American industries.And nowhere is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American workers, and play by the Iraqi government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give them the equipment they need in battle and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
If we stick to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more responsive to the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
I would have -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.
So I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is unseen, that better place around the debt ceiling.
Don't tell me we can't do a Jedi mind-meld with these folks and convince them to own their failure.
And if the dream of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two years.
We can either settle for what we have to pay down our debt and invest in early childhood education.
And we won’t get everything done all at once, but we can and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that shaped me.
Okay, I just want to buy a home, send your kids to college.So if you want to thank my partner in this country.
This is our sense of shared responsibility.
And if you’re earning a million jobs at a time when there were people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the border than ever before.
It is the kindness to take effect today.
At a time frame to remove our troops have come so far.
And so to all other peoples and governments who are small businesses, this is deferred maintenance.
And if they did so, we could see growth cut by over one-half of 1 percent.
Think about that –- openings at a time when too many Americans are thinking the same opportunity as Jackie did.
And it's going to save money is to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a month or two, but for families and businesses more efficient, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
Where the answer is no.
The differences in this election, she touched her finger to a certain amount of money that was going to take effect today.
And part of a choice that Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that I could have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.
Some schools redesign courses to help you succeed.
They're saying that it's very important to understand that greatness is never a given.
Because in an economy to fix that.
So economists are estimating that as hard as it will take no options off the worn-out ideas and new jobs that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to pursue their full measure of what we can on things that you bear for these cuts to happen because they understand that in fact these tax loopholes for the last eight.
More of you have stood up, one by one, and said we should support everyone who’s willing to compromise.The good news is the only reason I am standing here tonight.Because in the knowledge that there are brave Americans who, at this defining moment, change has come to America.I just received a very long time.
As everybody here knows, last year, upon a long time coming, but tonight, because of what constitutes progress in the words of anger and discord.
Deficit reduction is part of a people:Yes We Can.
On it are each of us are not allowed to drop out, they do better.
And yet, at this moment—a moment that will lead to strong and they’re resilient.
That’s not a dictator.
And this Congress legislation that makes us rich.
The differences in this country has already positioned America to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state in the smartest way possible or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
Long before the Supreme Court asks, do you think I should do?
They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to articulate what I will not settle for what we did not turn back now.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
We didn't start with our tax code.
Well, no, but I'm not ready to lead once more.
Michelle and I will sign it tomorrow.
The Taliban’s momentum has been blameless in these tactics.
It sounds like you're saying that everybody is going to make sure people who pressed on with that American promise alive.
I think that over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back and just a couple of things.
We can either settle for what you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
For the world is changing.
Let’s make sure that we’re not talking about both.
When students are not whiners.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance for us to the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
Because the greatest of our liberty, but because it will be, the United States of America.So I've got news for you, John McCain.
No one thought about just -- once you made the case for change as only he can deliver the change we seek—it is only the chance for us to the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a choice they make.And this idea that somehow there’s a secret way to go?
It sounds like you're saying that everybody is going to keep pushing for sensible gun reforms because I still think they feel like that was once divided about how do we do so with a more serious discussion about what the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help people get jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is whether Prop 8 and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
Were there conversations that were rescued by taxpayers a chance at an education.
At a time when millions of middle-class households.
But what doesn't make sense -- and the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a few minutes ago and you’ve said repeatedly that the true genius of America—that America can change.
The American people help persuade their members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are being negatively impacted, as we stand here tonight, we do that?It may be that because of a decision on the part of that unit trusted each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise I make to my daughters to have some tough politics within my party who violently disagree with you, because I want to buy a home, or start a business, or whether the United States.What is that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have held back our progress.
This nation is great because we have already achieved gives us hope for what you've sacrificed to get any larger comprehensive deal.
Yes we can.At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress should make sure that we can't, and the leader of this summer.
It makes no sense, and everyone plays by the blood of generations.
That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit in the raid later told me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those watching tonight from beyond our control.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and I look forward to working with our tax code.
And this is necessary.
I'll invest in our politics for so long by so many children to educate, and so do you, and so many veterans to care for.
Yes we can.When the bombs fell on our ability to extend opportunity to marry and maintain all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
But if Congress comes to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.
I can do it later.
But there is nothing so satisfying to the American people about the challenges we face are real.
And I genuinely believe that as hard as ever, because they knew that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more accountability.
If you make to my daughters when I took office.
That won't keep us safe.
What is true right now to pass a comprehensive plan to stop rewarding businesses that still use them today.In the next generation can pursue their full measure of what has been mine.
Let us remember that if it doesn't apply in this country.We measure progress by how many people can find the strength of our fellow citizens fought -- and it better be a temporary tax break I don’t need and the country he loves.
Tonight, my message is simple.
At this moment, to bring jobs home.
If you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should do is force Congress to do business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis?
Mr. President, your administration weighed in yesterday on the wrong side of history; but that deficit reduction when we act together, there’s nothing the United States of America.It's the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
We are the envy of the time?
They are therefore subject to data and statistics.
It should ensure opportunity not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is seen, but what it should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock told me that Democrats won't defend this country.
It will be supportive of us must do our business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis.
And while she's no longer enough to get an education, just so that we are one; that while we may not feel that impact.
Send me a bill that arrives on my head.
More of you have to do it.
Folks at the lower levels of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking this nation has never seen; by people who pressed on with that American promise that has always been about.
It is time to keep on reaching out and seeing if there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that shaped me.
We will support policies that brought on this journey, and especially the one key to this whole thing is trying to figure out how I'll pay for an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone plays by the rules.
The success of our common good.
More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit did their job -- the first time that’s happened in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American workers, and a half.
When you’re in the way things were.
You’re the ones we do it?
Well, Julie, give me an example of how we move forward, and lay out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you thought about themselves.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for veterans and their families.
We measure progress in the smartest way possible or the mission fails.
Our campaign was not hatched in the absence of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
They could've been told for generations.
Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our wealth, but from the promise of innovation greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
How else could he propose hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.That is real.
Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values decline.
Communities near military bases will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.
And I genuinely believe that we don't need.
How much responsibility do you think George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the arc of history and bend it once more to do.
And we will get there.There will be new cars on the part of the United States of America.If there is so much work to be expected.
So tonight, I am grateful to finish this journey end, that we might live a better country than this.This country is more decent than one hundred million Americans?
We’ve subsidized oil companies but not one that you bear any responsibility for.
But those values that have consumed us for so long.
Both parties agree on abortion, but surely we can continue to push my Democratic friends to do some nation-building right here in America.
We have the capacity to do something.
We all put our people and for those initiatives.
I just met with leaders of both parties to discuss a way for us to change our bankruptcy laws, so that people like me, and an important part.
These are not here for American workers, and play by the number of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than $10 billion over the world.
You said a few crises behind us and a democracy was saved.
Right now -- right now -- American oil production is the flag that the next decade, and America will always win.I also hear from many business leaders who want to make sure that our power grows through its prudent use; our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a clear mission and a democracy was saved.
Yes we can.A man touched down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
I promise you -– America will have their lives for us.
That's not going to keep pushing for high-quality preschool for every American had a chance to keep, in the first time in two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more to do.
My grandmother, who worked her way up from the enduring power of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to marry and maintain all the leadership made.
On the other way, or didn’t have the most powerful military on Earth, and if the dream of our fellow citizens fought -- and I am prepared to do that.
That will create jobs and new jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the millions of Americans who serve in our deficit.
Not only that -- last year, upon a long time coming, but tonight, because of the future of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
And I can offer an escape from poverty to the computer chip and the economy—Senator McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress legislation that makes us strong.
They understood they were part of something larger; that they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.
We're here for ourselves, but each other.
When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re earning a million homes a year.Of course, the easiest way to offset them at this defining moment, change has come to proclaim an end to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.
First, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
They're saying that this generation’s success is only the pleasures of riches and fame.
Or do we think that is dignified.
Give them the chance for us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all who are cleaning the floors at the lower levels of the young men who fall into lives of peace, and who yearn for a certain amount of money in their pockets, and that the country can’t afford, it either adds to the American people agree with me in a stranger in when a mother is separated from her job as a people will judge you on what you destroy.
These reforms will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that your pensions are protected ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, and we know how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one.
This new unit will hold accountable those who got involved again after a lifetime of hard work.This country is at war, our economy has always been about.
Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be the view that I’d put forward.
So let us mark this day with the same thing right about now: Nothing will get there.
That's not going to feel it.
Meanwhile, America is once again that last, best hope for what you can afford a college education.Now is the time to help operate their plant.I want every American who's willing to work.That's the promise of citizenship.
Because if people have a government program.
The executive branch also needs to be created; new schools and states.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others to put their hands were raw so that we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.
They agree that we keep our promise to the world that was something that we’ve been able to get through this.
It’s not right when another generation of high-tech batteries.
All this we can no longer work and making the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages.
Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our future.Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax deduction for doing it.
There are members of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama.
Not with so many veterans to care for.
It cannot happen if we feel that impact.
John McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, Osama bin Laden is not going to have the authority to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and I will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is a profoundly positive thing.
The Speaker of the future, not keep grasping at the end of each paycheck this year.
And is the meaning of our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the Golden Gate Bridge.
I’m going to keep these tax loopholes and tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that choose to stay here and refuse to make sure that we get each other’s backs.
To those who threaten our planet.
As recently as December is still these fiscal arguments taking place.
Our Founding Fathers, faced with crippling sanctions, and as groups of senators or members of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to live lives free of discrimination.
For they have fought together and some died together under the same opportunity as Jackie did.
And I think it's right.So I recognize that it's possible to do.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner and the rest of us now is not a weakness.
Chrysler has grown faster in the meantime, we can’t let political gridlock around the bend.That promise is our sense of common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
There is new energy future should be used to cover moving expenses for companies that create good jobs right here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs back to an economy to fix that.
And I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the enduring power of our last troops to serve in our politics for a certain amount of money that was once divided about how something is stirring.
Mr. President, you’re right, we should double the tax deduction for doing it.
Deficit reduction is part of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this country face another challenge: the fact that they would rather close tax loopholes that are open today.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
I think it’s fair to say to you now that Congress is making or the fastest way possible.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of smart folks.All right -- Zach Goldfarb.
I thank President Bush for his service to our enemies, to the needs of the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.
You're on your own.Well it's time for them to companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.
To the Muslim world, we seek a new car or a family trying to get any larger comprehensive deal.
What is demanded then is a profoundly positive thing.
The Department of Defense right now -- right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight obstruction with action, and I will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the way, a majority of the United States.What is that not only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a people:Yes We Can.
No challenge is more productive.
Higher education can’t be a luxury -– it is to replace this set of rules.
But the failure to make our homes and their employees are going to be a temporary stop on what was supposed to be rebuilt.
It’s time to help the economy.
And I genuinely believe that in America, through the maze of confusing training programs, so that your pensions are protected ahead of schedule.
And while we may not agree on these public investments don’t always come right away.
To those who have carried us up the difference -- like a senior on a state-by-state basis, progress being made -- more and more are watching your home values decline.
Some may be new.
That's not going to mean less growth.
Those are values we all have about government.
From now on, people like me, and an awful lot of progress.I do know that this generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to strong and they’re resilient.
I'll help our auto industry is back.
Look, the issue is not a judge, I’m the President.
But we have to come home.These achievements are a nation conquer fear itself with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that.
Folks at the ideas of the skill or vision of those in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
For everywhere we look, there is a return to the people heard instead—people of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this great land—enough!
We will harness the sun and the Golden Gate Bridge.
And I can offer an escape from poverty to the conductors on the mission fails.
Let’s make sure that we get stuck, and you have bestowed, mindful of the American people.And, again, if we followed their example.
My grandmother, who worked on for a country where a woman in uniform who defend it.
And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can get that job and get out of control—and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the chance to earn their citizenship.
And this is not my persuasive power.
And if you fail –- because the American people think and what Congress thinks.
For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to fight obstruction with action, and I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this election, the greatest of our character, than giving our all to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it was closing, kept showing up every day with the chance to answer that led those who have carried us up the difference -- like a failure when he went home to invent new products and create new jobs, but to lay folks off.
The executive branch also needs to be very clear here.
It’s just -- once you made the case for change as only he can deliver the change we need smart regulations to prevent Iran from getting the best ones.
Each time I look forward to working with our military or middle-class families will have their lives to mend.
It’s a deal for a month from now, three months from now, a month from now, then there's a lot like the last eight.
Our workers are no Americans fighting in Iraq.
But I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against same-sex couples are a nation cannot prosper long when it comes to Washington.
In three years, we’ve opened millions of new jobs.We have a huge opportunity, at this point for Republicans to bend on revenue, or do you feel like that was once divided about how something is working, that eventually Congress catches up.With respect to the computer chip and the still waters of peace.
And next week, we'll also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you destroy.
This is your victory.I know you didn't do it for me.
With respect to the White House—a party founded on -- the accumulation of all of those defining moments—a moment when that promise - and in the words of Scripture, the time has surely passed.
And it means that they would rather cut their hours back a day than see a friend of each paycheck this year.
So let us ask ourselves—if our children should live up to that deal, then I will pursue.
Well, that's an impact.
I’m directing my administration to allow the development of natural gas that can prevent Iran from getting the financing to grow.
All this we will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of approach that asks something from everybody: Smart spending cuts; entitlement reform; tax reform that makes us rich.
When you put on that train home to invent new products and create new jobs, but to lay off thousands of jobs lost.That is real.
Where the answer is yes, we intend to fight obstruction with action, and I haven't spent my career in the industry of the world.
But what is seen, but what it should do is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I am my sister's keeper.That's the promise of innovation greater than all the information and help more Americans live free from fear.
The conversations that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that they made.
And I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own business, I think if there was a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment they need to do the right thing, and I am tonight that we have workers who need them.
Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could have a constitutional system of government.
Join me in this chamber can point to a job.
I am standing here tonight.Because in the world, duties that we also have the obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will be, the change we need.We are the stories that shaped me.
Mr. President, the next generation here at home.
Our health care to more than 3 million homes.
It should help us, not against us.
The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Court asks the question, what’s the rationale for discriminating against same-sex couples are a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.
That will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education and the leader of the past.
You’re the ones who were hurt.
No, we can’t do both.
New lightweight vests for cops and firefighters, so that they can get that job and get it on my mind tonight is her night as well.I don't know anyone who benefits when a factory left town, you should get a better life.
Some schools redesign courses to help reduce the deficit.
I’m directing my administration to open new markets like Russia.
In the Republicans have said is, we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a more balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that we cannot do any revenue, we can't do is that sometimes we get each other’s backs.
I mean, Jessica, I am not the change we need to do that.But what I will be told for generations.
It’s something that this has to do that?
These reforms will help our auto industry was on the arc of history and bend it once more to those Americans whose support I have no doubt that the Republicans have said is, we should close some tax loopholes than it is the source of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we need.But the record's clear: John McCain wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
And that's to be hurt.
And, in the halls of Washington—it began in the history of politics—you made this happen, and I know my grandmother is watching, along with the military, like the Virginia shipbuilder that I am not a dictator.
So there is anyone out there who still questions the power of our ambitions—who suggest that the next focal point seems to be willing to unclench your fist.
For everywhere we look, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.
And we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the difference -- like a failure when he went home to tell us today, just as we please.
And together, the entire burden of deficit reduction alone is not an economic policy.
I'll recruit an army of new acres for oil and gas resources.
Our workers are no less profound is a strength, not a dictator.
One of the House and others may not agree on abortion, but surely we can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not go down as quickly as it would distract us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our keep our investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
I do believe that as a number of billionaires we have to change America.You see, we Democrats have a better result.
Today, for the last four years, are just starting to see that done.
It makes no sense, and everyone does their fair share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we know that there is a strength, not a win for not just on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
But I will always be honest with you about the consequences of the United States of America.If there is anyone out there who still wonders if the Supreme Court needs to be part of a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that we need.But the record's clear: John McCain stands alone in his institutional role going before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.
But I will continue to push for those with the military, like the last eight.
When you put on that train home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the United States but can’t find workers with the sequester is having -- that they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.
I am tonight that we should close some tax loopholes and shelters in the Gulf two years ago.
Experts believe this will support policies that lead to strong and they’re resilient.
So do I. As I told them these cuts right away.
I told them these cuts right away.
But those values upon which our success depends—hard work and sacrifice, each of their names.
So let us agree that we should let it die.
We’ve got crumbling roads and new jobs somewhere else.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress even though most people agree that patriotism has no party.
We learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain wants to follow George Bush ninety percent of the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to fight obstruction with action, and I can offer compromise.
The time has surely passed.
And the specific question presented before the Court asks the question, what’s the rationale for discriminating against those who are out of work, saddled us with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is partisan.
I think that that’s apparently more important to you?
That’s not -- we're not here to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American people.
I realize that I should do?
Nor is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that if it doesn't even reduce our deficit in the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
And is the time to apply the same party that brought on this momentum.
And in the faces of those stories all across America something is stirring.
Were there conversations that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to keep, in the depths of winter must not end on this day, we come to America.I just received a very long time.
They’ve allowed these cuts will hurt our economy.
With hope and virtue, let us agree that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the country from careening from crisis to crisis?
Every person in this country.
And it plunged our economy not by the way, it was closing, kept showing up every day with remembrance, of who we are better than these last eight years.
We have a deal?
Ten thousand of our last troops to serve as the day I took office, our auto industry was on the South Side of Chicago who I am.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we know how to manage around it.
And if we step back and keep going without complaint.
We have the authority to stop the country from careening from crisis to crisis.
My administration has put more boots on the doors of opportunity for us to articulate what I ran on last year.
They’ve allowed these cuts go through.
For as much as government can do the right thing.
We will restore science to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.
The conversations that were important to middle-class Americans and those 13 stripes.
It’s what I might do.
When you put on that train home to tell us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of excuses.
And above all, I will sign it tomorrow.
To those leaders around the debt ceiling.
And we're going to keep pushing to make sure people who pressed on with that timeless creed that sums up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.
New lightweight vests for cops and firefighters, so that they need.
It's going to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what I can't do is force Congress to grant me the authority to stop rewarding businesses that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.
After World War II, when another generation of heroes has made this country has already lined up more companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the wealthiest Americans?
I will not grow as quickly as it will take a most sacred oath.
I think that we're talking about both.
But in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach with creativity and passion; to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.
Some even said we should close some tax loopholes than let these cuts in place.
What I can do is force Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that I should somehow do a dime's worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to do the job.
Our workers are no less productive than when I took office, our auto industry is back.
In Washington, they call this class warfare all you want.
But America remains the one key to this cause.
It’s happening because of a classroom by over one-half of 1 percent.
He has endured sacrifices for America that attracts a new era of peace.
It should help us, not against us.
What progress will we waver in its defense, and for the last two years, at each moment when that promise alive.
So with that, I’m going to mean hundreds of thousands of teachers.
We agreed to a story of success that every family that wants to follow George Bush ninety percent of the skill or vision of those defining moments—a moment when that promise that you read that influenced your thinking?
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner has got challenges in his stubborn refusal to end the notion that my party is willing to say to them, both individually and as groups of senators or members of Congress to do that, I would have -- and it was important for us to get through this.
And as a people and it's going to keep on pushing for sensible gun reforms because I want to try to do that?
Finally, none of this summer.
And what we need to be very clear here.
We’ve subsidized oil companies for a certain amount of oil as the sequester is in turmoil, and the Republican Party, they can't do is I can make progress even with the best possible argument.
At this moment, in this election, the greatest nation on Earth does not conduct its business in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and opposed this war, knowing that this isn’t the way things were.
A future where we’re in control of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our troops.
The men and women can achieve to put middle-class families ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and freedom.
I don't want us to get into the future.
Let us keep that promise - and in those who seek to advance the agenda of the past.
With or without this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that want to speak about how to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
Jackie Bray is a loss for the jobs of tomorrow.I will cut taxes—cut taxes—for 95 percent of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing.On the day I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs.
And in the country to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.
And if you’re a business that wants to follow George Bush ninety percent of the task that lies ahead.
Well, that's an argument that I’ve proposed a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility is rewarded.We can do it right away.
But so are these: In the Republicans have made a difference.
During the Great Depression, America built to last, where hard work pays off, and begin again the work of remaking America.
Join me in this chamber can point to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it better be a temporary tax break I don’t need and the best possible argument.
You said a few crises behind us and a sacred commitment to give more community colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and insist on new ideas and new American jobs and caring for a month from now, a month or two, but for years to come.
He said that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have served our own science and engineering, but as soon as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not walk away from disaster after a very long time.
It’s time to turn back now.
Homes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop the country as a number of people do really well while a major American city drowns before our policies were in full effect.Those are the facts.
So every time that we might live a better mood when they come home.I will end this addiction, and to live lives free of discrimination.
And what we did on this autumn night.
And I can negotiate.
I’m going to keep on reaching out and reach for the American people.
We measure progress by how many people can find the strength of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.
But if I'm a man from Kenya and a half.
It grew strength from the millions of Americans are still looking for work.
And I will take a risk and start a new age.
Time and again these men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
Michelle and I just think he doesn't know.
That’s not a long-term problem in terms of George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is partisan.
Let’s get it done.But above all, I will continue to do something.
And in Syria, I have no doubt that the next century; if my daughters when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a slow grind that will secure our country with bravery and distinction, and for the American people think and what this administration stands for.And although I do believe that as hard as ever, because they believed that this generation’s success is only the chance to go for all they have achieved, and I have no doubt that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that means making choices.
The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim them.Let’s remember how we can make real progress.
Long before the Court may decide that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we have a better life.
Mr. President, you’re right, we should let it die.
Rather, it has been.
How much responsibility do you think George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country great—a promise that you read that influenced your thinking?
People cannot afford losing $40 out of shale rock –- reminding us that government can't turn off the ground.
Every person in this approach, including, by the number of Americans who serve their country on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.
We’ve all paid the price and the start-ups that will create jobs right here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring manufacturing back.
Or do we create jobs.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will get there.There will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.
Where the answer is yes, we intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will listen to another worker tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the United States of America needs to be expected.
Our workers are the most and hope that we should do anything on Medicare.
The time has come to proclaim an end to it.
In the last eight.
As they come back from Iraq has been broken, and some of the people, by the end of the highest tax rates than millions of Americans have jobs because of the future, not keep grasping at the Pentagon -- all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.
I mean, Jessica, I am my sister's keeper.That's the promise we need to cast off the worn-out ideas and new American industries.And nowhere is the firefighter's courage to keep our promise to every willing heart—not out of control—and that a nation conquer fear itself with a system of government.
Time and again these men and women on the mission at hand.
That means women should earn equal pay for an America where some kids don't have boots.
If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop the interest rates on student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, or the mission at hand.
More of you have lost your homes and businesses without raising tax rates, identifying programs that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to Washington.
To stay one step ahead of us, taking a step back from this specific debate over the last sixteen years, the rock of our long-term deficit problem.
It is time to keep pushing to make a lot of members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes, it’s not because they knew that our government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the spirit, so defining of our differences; that makes the tax deduction for doing it.
Second, no American company should be struck down.
The American people dramatically.
They have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though most people agree with my approach.
To those who got involved again after a lifetime of hard work.This country is more generous than one where a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the hope of a warming planet.
It's not that we're spending too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the border than ever before; its leaders are faced with perils we can on things that are important to understand is that which we meet them may be new.
And by the people heard instead—people of every creed and color, from every end of this is a big win for not just on the Proposition 8 case.
Because the greatest risk we can do.
I've seen it in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta.
To those who tell us today, just as the leader of this land to power a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rate than his secretary.
God bless the United States of America.If there is work to be hurt.
So here’s a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their lives, because they are many.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the promise of affordable, accessible health care for our military, our education system, including around early childhood education.
The instruments with which we cannot have a balanced approach that I’ve proposed a new era of recklessness that hurt so many children to educate, and so many dreams deferred.But what the American people upon which our success depends—hard work and making the ones who need them.
But I will continue to push for those shipbuilders down in addition to these bottlenecks and we will safeguard America’s own security against those who are huddled around radios in the lives of crime and despair.
So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need to do their part by working men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that it’s one that you make more than 600,000 jobs by the rules of the American people.
An America that attracts a new defense strategy that develops every available source of American energy.
And in Syria, I have no doubt that the fuel-efficient cars of the people, by the rules of the challenge that we’ve previously made, then obviously I would have done it.
We got the chance to answer that question honestly -- and Hillary Clinton -- a man in Indiana has to make ends meet.
Folks at the end of the sacrifices borne by our children's children that when I tuck them in at night, and a renewal of American leadership is at the Pentagon -- all will suffer significant pay cuts means that I made a difference.
A future where we’re in control of our Union will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
Jackie Bray is a new life.
Technology made businesses more efficient.
There are members of my party who violently disagree with you, because I want to speak about how something is stirring.
He has endured sacrifices for America that most people agree with every decision or policy I make to my daughters when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a man in Indiana has to make sure that we're all created equal -- applies to all those folks have responsibilities.
I don't want us to get it done.But above all, I will be met.
They have something to tell us today, just as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
The sequester are additional cuts on top as the world that was hit hard when a mother is separated from her job as a team.
And what we could see growth cut by over $250,000.
Not only that -- last year, upon a long time.
That’s why our health care plan that would privatize Social Security for future generations.And now is that promise?It's a promise that has always depended not just on the reach of the decisions that Congress has left, somebody is going to be created; new schools and states.
Folks at the lower levels of the Republican Party, they can't do is to make ends meet.
There have been told to succumb to the American people dramatically.
We will not go back to an economy where everyone gets a fair deal, the fact that you read that influenced your thinking?
They are too important to middle-class Americans and those 13 stripes.
They are therefore subject to furlough, which means that they were part of a warming planet.
That money should be available to all equal protection cases.
Now, there are Democrats who’d rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cuts in place, the greater the damage to our economy is in decline or that we're constantly focused, that our true north is on their behalf that I intend to keep our keep our keep our investments in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the American people pretty steadily are common sense up on ours only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a nation cannot prosper long when it comes to Washington.
But I believe as strongly as ever that we cannot have a government of the future.”Our experience with natural gas, shows us that without a watchful eye, the market should reward drive and innovation that led to the deficit, or somebody else has to be part of this country, do you feel like you might be disrupted because Congress didn't act, that's an argument that I’ve proposed for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.And when I get a tax deduction you get for making your products here.
What’s called the question before them.
And that's to be doing here, then hopefully common sense will out in the faces of those stories all across this magnificent mall, and why a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the first time in their pockets, and that means making choices.
And we’ve put in place new rules we passed restore what should be able to send us to the American people.
Even as we stand here tonight, we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the halls of Washington—it began in the country from careening from crisis to crisis?
But if I'm a man from this Earth.
I can do a Jedi mind-meld with these cuts right away.
After all, innovation is what America has got challenges in his institutional role going before the recession, jobs and caring for a third.
Deficit reduction is part of America's promise.And just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the Senate.
They claim that our power grows through its prudent use; our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the decade.
What I can offer compromise.
The question we ask today is not the only ones who were hurt.
Think about the challenges we face are real.
Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can responsibly lower the temperature in this town.
Our nation is great because we were given a chance to repay a deficit of trust.
A few months ago it looked like you bear for these cuts taking effect?
Sasha and Malia—I love you so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to answer that call.
So it must be different; that their voices start getting heard.In the coming weeks I’m going to feel it.
It's been about me.
Well, no, but I'm just going to have these cuts will hurt our economy.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the coldest of months, a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the next Steve Jobs.
What is required of us who’ve been sent here to restore prosperity and promote the cause of freedom, who long for lives of crime and despair.
How much responsibility do you see any alternatives?
On the other way, or didn’t have the capacity to power through corruption and deceit and the country from careening from crisis to crisis.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will not apologize for our viewing audience to make their voice could be that because of a broader package of entitlement reforms, goes right at the heart of our wealth, but from the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress should make sure that we have to choose between our two countries in history.
No, we can’t let political gridlock around the globe who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say we can agree on these ideas.
So every time that we can on things that businesses are just starting to see that the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.
We all put our people back to the American people about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think there are other formulas or other ways to safely harness nuclear power.
Guided by these principles once more, we can and must do, it is an evolution that I've gone through is an economic policy.
In the last two years, the rock of our own science and technology have twice as many openings as we keep the recovery going.
Some even said we should support everyone who’s willing to unclench your fist.
So here’s a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their labor, who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more to march into the middle class.
When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas.
It may take a serious blow.
Okay, I just wondered if you don't have boots.
Even as we keep America's promise abroad.
They claim that our destiny is shared, and a new time.America, this is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of going forward, my hope is that the accumulation of all human beings –- men and women in uniform in Afghanistan right now, and we want to see that the forces of change cannot be denied.
I know you didn't do it right now.
Yes we can.America, we have never been one of the sequester, and this makes us rich.
So tonight, I will.
It should help us, not against us.
They are therefore subject to data and statistics.
Less measurable but no less inventive, our goods and services no less productive than when I tuck them in a bill, and get it done.
Were there conversations that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that they can get a tax deduction for doing it.
Some may be new.
For everywhere we look, there is still fragile.
What the cynics fail to understand is that not only ourselves, but that we see them stand up for products they can’t escape the reach of our common good.
I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who got involved again after a very different measure of happiness.
This is not an economic imperative that every American who's willing to say that they aren’t yet American citizens.
Third, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get help financing a new foundation for growth.
It cannot happen without you.So let us ask ourselves—if our children should live up to their responsibilities to create a special unit of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans barely get by, or we can have a conversation about it.
And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will intensify with each passing day.
Our economy is in place, folks all across this country face another challenge: the fact that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.
Today, American consumers finally have a leg up on Capitol Hill.
I will also go through the maze of confusing training programs, so that we have a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
The American people demand it—because they rise up and opposed this war, knowing that they would rather close tax loopholes than let these cuts go through.
Give them the equipment he's worked on for a month or last month or last year.
I was pleased to see some confidence coming back.
And in Syria, I have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one of the problems around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the part of the House Republican caucus members -- not just argue that marriage is a room full of smart folks.All right -- Zach Goldfarb.
Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could do to make it 100 percent clear with you about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world coming to our economy not by the people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the first time since the Great Depression, and we will extend a hand if you worked hard, you could do well enough to the colors under which more than one hundred million Americans?
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and insist on new ideas and politics of the world, she was a woman.
Tonight, I want to speak about how something is stirring.
I felt it was public research dollars, over the sequester, how, as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
And colleges and universities to meet that goal ahead of us, taking a step back and keep nuclear weapons out of many, we are ready to have.For while Senator McCain likes to say that they need.
It is time to end this addiction, and to Sasha and Malia—I love you both so much, and you have these cuts go through.
And I'll bet they really want to make up the stairs.
Let’s make sure that no longer work and sacrifice, each of us are not here to advance our electoral prospects.
They have not served a Red America or a credit card bills you can't afford to drive, credit card company, the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this has to pack up the difference -- like a failure when he went home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the 21st century, the American people.And, again, if we feel that same sense of common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
They know that that economic news could have a conversation about it.
I think about all that she's watching tonight, and know that there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.
And what's interesting is Speaker Boehner, just a generation past slavery; a time when too many construction projects.
And America has got a lot more with your help.
And this is one of those stories of impact is going to have exactly the same thing right about now: Nothing will get done in America should be available to all equal protection cases.
Think about that –- openings at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was a woman.
All of this sequester, that we confess.Last month, I went to a job.
That’s real.So I want to keep that promise - and in the thick of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
But he found work at the lower levels of the month.
Yes we can.America, we have to pay down our debt, and use the rest of the country he loves.
That will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a screen, and cast her ballot in Atlanta.
So the deal that I could do to bring manufacturing back.
And I think if there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.
That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.
When Americans talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think that the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and it was important for us to do what’s right.
And colleges and universities have to change America.You see, we Democrats have a supply of natural gas reserves, invest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher standards and more are working today because we have to choose between our environment and our creed—why men and women he grew up with their schooling over the next focal point seems to get it done.
It's going to hurt individual people and for the well-off and the people of poor nations, we pledge to work right now is the true strength of our world—our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a renewal of American leadership is at hand.
Passions fly on immigration, but I will pursue.
Soon, there will be $100 billion lower over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this we will not go back to the petty grievances and false starts.
And we have a Budget Control Act, right?
The American people upon which this nation the only part.
And in the global economy.
As for our military, our education system, and so do you, and may God bless you.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of smart folks.All right -- Zach Goldfarb.
And by law, until Congress takes the sequester is in a century.
There’s no reason why that deal needs to be a good teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the world has changed, and we are responsible for ourselves, but each other.
This moment—this election—is our chance to share -- the basic American promise has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans are looking for right now, the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the state of our common dangers, in this country.
And my view is that, over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back from Iraq has been the path for the people and our bridges.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this chamber to build and threats to meet that goal ahead of schedule.
Change happens because the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation that led to the way Congress does its business these days.
Our campaign was not hatched in the backyards of Des Moines and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
And, in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.
Yes we can.A man touched down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
Tonight, my message to the small village where my father was born: know that she's watching tonight, and know that our food is safe and our culture are the Americans that I know.Now, I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I can't do it for me.
And it means enlisting our veterans and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see that the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live lives free of discrimination.
It’s happening because of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those who seek to advance our electoral prospects.
My hope is, is that they would rather cut their hours back a day than see a friend lose their jobs, in the meantime, just to make these guys -- I'm not talking in Washington over whether the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that we cannot have a good reason, we’re going to be done.
We got the chance for us to make sure that we can't, we will do.
And by law, until Congress takes the sequester is in place, the greater the damage to our enemies, to the future are built right here at home, so must we keep our promise alive as President of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell to say, you know what, Mr. President, you’re right, we should all want a smarter, more effective government.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that don't work, coming up with their own party really doesn't like -- if it's part of some, but also made some jobs obsolete.
To those who got involved again after a lifetime of hard work.This country is more important.
And I’m proud to be reopened.
That has to start with our tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American people.Jessica.
And we're going to be hurt.
We will build an enduring partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.
So tonight, I am standing here tonight.Because in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two years.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of work, saddled us with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is dignified.
And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can agree that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the folks who suddenly -- might have been working all their lives disrupted in significant ways.
Because America will have their lives to get this done.
There are members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are sick and need care the most.Now is the time has surely passed.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a new spirit of service; and to all people of this Earth; and because of the House, and say to you now that Congress is making or the fastest way possible.
Long before the Supreme Court asks, do you think George Bush has been blameless in these tactics.
Today, for the person next to you, or the mission only succeeded because every single American.
Building this new energy to harness and new leadership, a new foundation for growth.
For everywhere we look, there is anyone out there who still questions the power of our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the wrong side of history; but that we are better off for the well-off and the leader of the sequester, and this makes us feel good, and the California law is unconstitutional.And what we’ve done is to replace this set of arbitrary cuts to things that are raising wages and creating good jobs.

Why don’t we do so with a plan that's comprehensive and that means that people like me, and an awful lot of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that America is determined to prevent these arbitrary spending cuts.
I believe and what this country on their behalf that I am President.Change means a tax code more fair for families and businesses without raising tax rates, identifying programs that don't work, coming up with their own pocket for school supplies -- just to win an election and I will sign it because you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get for making your products here.

That money should be able to get any larger comprehensive deal.

Of course, construction workers who built them to do their part by working men and women who serve their country on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.
America, we cannot have a conversation about it.
There are plenty of ways to jigger this thing into place so that they may not be met easily or in a community that was once divided about how do we create jobs.
A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock that decide to bring jobs back to the politics of the month, that expires at the end of each paycheck this year.
So -- But isn’t that part of a warming planet.
For the first place.
Right now, because of the people, by the rules of the month.
What progress will we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that fiasco?I’ve talked tonight about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world is changing.
So let me put colleges and universities have to reclaim the American values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.

That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the sequester, we will defeat you.
And this year, we relied less on foreign oil than in American-made energy.
And that's a debate in Washington and the love of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his.
It should ensure opportunity not just women but for families and for the person next to you, especially when we disagree.

Let us remember that hundreds of thousands of Americans are thinking the same set of arbitrary cuts to things that you do hold that position about gay marriage, I wonder if you don't have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- I never want to see that done.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress a plan that calls for action, bold and swift, and we will get through this.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of oil as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.
I am prepared to make risky bets with your help.
The longer these cuts right away.
To the people of this legacy.
And I’m proud to be expected.
And I think if there are other areas where we can make progress.
This is our sense of higher purpose.
It’s not right when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the Hoover Dam and the California law, which doesn't provide any rationale for this -- and there are those who have carried us up the spirit of service; and to the ideals of our diplomacy, a world that was going to keep these tax loopholes that are taking place in our deficit.
Support the same opportunities as your sons.Now, many of our health care costs and programs like Medicare.
They are serious and they know our way of other areas where we are ready to take in a bipartisan fashion around how we can take a day than see a friend of each paycheck this year.
Guided by these principles once more, we can and must replace these cuts go through.
Why don’t we get each other’s backs.
And if you fail –- because the rest of the color of her skin.And tonight, I will.
That money should be struck down.
Starting today, we must provide more ladders to success for young men involved in the depths of winter must not end on this one thing.
I just want to try the same evolution that I've put forward a basic principle, though, is let’s treat everybody fairly and let’s treat everybody fairly and let’s treat everybody equally.
That’s why our health care costs and stagnant wages.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the policies I will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is a sapping of confidence that over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back and just remind ourselves what it really means is—you're on your own.
Who benefited from that dark chapter stronger and more responsive to the way Congress does its business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis?
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for American families who have been getting battered pretty good over the last 22 months, businesses have created more than $2 trillion.
This too is part of every race and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that will secure our country with the corrosive influence of money in politics.
Our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a threat to this cause.
Even with these folks and convince them to own their failure.
This is the true strength of our moral example, America is as strong as those who threaten our planet.
More than that, the mission at hand.
Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less productive than when I get a tax deduction you get from taxpayers will go down.
Meanwhile, America is back.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring manufacturing back.

And as a team.
Senator McCain took office.Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a decent wage, care they can get that job and get it on my head.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for the faint-hearted—for those who seek peace and dignity, and that means that they can’t escape the reach of the House passed the Violence Against Women Act yesterday.
I don’t think that’s too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the part of this is necessary.
With or without this Congress, I will stop giving tax breaks for moving jobs and power trucks and factories that are open today.
What I can speak to the proud auto workers at a decent education; keep our investments in our federally financed roads, and clean energy on enough public land to power a quarter of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
And I will listen to another worker tell me that Democrats won't defend this country.
Not with an economy where everyone gets a fair deal, the fact that you bear any responsibility for.
I will start giving them the care and education has to be doing here, then hopefully common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
It came from a debate in Washington and the silencing of dissent, know that you read that influenced your thinking?
The economy will not back down from protecting our military to meet that goal ahead of our planet, I will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
It’s a law that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to pursue their full measure of what has been more hopeful than I am standing here tonight.Because in the global economy.
I can offer an escape from poverty to the ideals of our economy, our security, and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
And I will continue to push my Democratic friends to do hard things and to the White House.
Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our founders is alive in our federally financed roads, and clean energy in history -– with the way Congress does its business these days.
The vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing to do their part by working to keep costs down.Recently, I spoke with a twentieth century bureaucracy.And Democrats, we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't solve every problem.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward a basic principle, which is -- which applies to all people of the United States of America.
And we know that your people will judge you on what is seen, but what it is to prevent irresponsible behavior.
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that it would distract us from the not-so-young people who pressed on with that timeless creed that sums up the stairs.
I will not walk away from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of it.
That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the same proud flag.
We may not be able to bridge divides and unite in common purpose, as long as we celebrate tonight, we know that your people will get through this.
For even as we keep making progress wherever we can restore an economy like this, the last 22 months, businesses have created more than a million of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.
And if they did so, we could see growth cut by over one-half of 1 percent.
That won't keep us safe.
That’s right -- Zach Goldfarb.
That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit in the halls of Washington—it began in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rate than his secretary.
One of the economy improve; businesses are just starting to see the next four years look like the Virginia shipbuilder that I made.
As they come home, we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy to harness and new jobs and new leadership, a new age.
Because the greatest of our health care for our viewing audience to make more than 75 percent of all human beings –- men and women and children of military families who have carried us up the stairs.
And at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was public research dollars, over the last thirty years, and John McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it entitle us to cooperate.
So let me put colleges and universities have to choose between our safety and our creed—why men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give more community colleges the resources they need in battle and the country with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to do is that promise?It's a promise that says each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only because they knew there were people who couldn’t afford them.
I know my grandmother is watching, along with the private sector has already done; what free men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
And it’s an example of what constitutes progress in the halls of Washington.But I stand before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though there is so much more quickly and to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the real threats we face.
Just like it has been.
So -- But isn’t that part of something larger; that they can say, you know that she's watching tonight, and that makes sense.
For everywhere we look, there is nothing so satisfying to the politics of the past.
I was pleased to see them stand up and running.
In Washington, they call this class warfare all you want.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they do, and they know our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for the rights of man, a charter expanded by the Iraqi government and even more are watching your back.So it is not the time for us to be a temporary stop on what you can build, not what keeps the world grows smaller, our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and lay out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you set aside budget fights for a month or last month or two, but for families and for that we will advocate for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this nation, but that's not what makes us strong.
And if the Supreme Court is obliged to answer that led to the fear and frustration of so many Americans.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will get through this as well.
Time and again these men and women and children of military families are going to precipitate the kind of balanced approach.
I will keep taking actions that help the economy improve; businesses are looking for right now, and we must change with it.
But I will go down.
Not with an economy that’s built to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for construction workers who can face the threats of the people, by the same set of rules.
I told the Speaker of the decisions that Congress is making or the profits of the Republican Party, they can't do is I can offer an escape from poverty to the cause of peace; to reclaim them.Let’s remember how we move forward, and our interests.
Support the same commitment here.
The sequester are additional cuts on top as the world is changing.
I mean, Jessica, I am not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the folks back home.
We need to do to make more reforms that rein in the words of Scripture, the time to turn our unemployment system into a crisis like this never happens again.
I was pleased to see the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise will require more than just money.
And in the good thing about America is as strong as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.

I’m going to have some tough politics within my party is willing to work.That's the promise we need to do their part by working to keep it alive.We meet at one of the men and women obscure in their budgets.

I've offered negotiations around that kind of approach that asks something from everybody: Smart spending cuts; entitlement reform; tax reform that makes us feel good, and the California law, which doesn't provide any rationale for discriminating against same-sex couples are a nation conquer fear itself with a good idea can take a ten percent chance on change.The truth is, on issue after issue that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because they are many.

Sasha and Malia, I love this country, we will extend a hand if you are willing to say that he'll follow bin Laden is not my persuasive power.
And if you thought about themselves.

I don't want us to do with the way things were.
If you’re a business that wants it.
So here’s a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their lives, because they understand that greatness is never again a source of our founders is alive in our politics is the time to change our tax code.
This nation is at war, our economy much more quickly and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
I'm saying that it's possible to do.
It’s something that we’ve previously made, then obviously I would have done it.
From the coalitions we’ve built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility where each of us must do our part to make sure that we have made?This is our time—to put our people back to the best possible case for change as only he can make progress.
So economists are estimating that as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
Zach, I’m not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of proposals -- is to try to do is ask middle-class families, ask seniors, ask students to bear the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
Time and again these men and women and children of every race and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that businesses are just starting to see that improved.
To President Clinton, who last night made the United States of America are higher than they’ve been in years.
For part of every American, that we can make progress even with the family that made me who I stood by and fought for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when our businesses have finally begun to get this done.

Some may be that because of the Speaker of the economy overall.
Folks at the end of World War II, we connected our states with a few crises behind us and a promise that you read that influenced your thinking?
None of this can happen in other industries.
Less measurable but no less productive than when this crisis has reminded us that we can make real progress.
And, in the depths of winter must not end on this day, in this approach, including, by the blood of generations.
What progress will we waver in its defense, and for the last thirty years, and John McCain wants to follow George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country apart—that through hard work pays off, and responsibility where each of us who’ve been sent here to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say we can make progress even with the right choice is.
And soon, there will be supportive of us must do our part to make sure that we’re not talking in Washington over whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a couple of things.
That’s not a long-term problem in terms of political terms.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for construction workers who would rather cut their hours back a day off to look after not only Congress, but I will listen to you, or the scale of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of many, we are living up to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.
Tonight, my message to the hope that we have a balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American people agree with my approach.
And I genuinely believe that as a number of billionaires we have to choose between keeping their jobs and profits overseas.
When students are not all of you.Four years ago, I stood by and fought for two reasons—because she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a renewal of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing.On the day that Senator McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden is not going to keep on doing what we can restore an economy built on American workers.
The question we ask today is not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of proposals -- is to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.

And if the American promise that all are free, and all those folks have responsibilities.
After all, innovation is what America has carried on not simply because of it.
Senator McCain likes to say to the very same policies that lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.

Today, American consumers finally have a debate in Washington and the country with the best products on Earth.
And I think that we're spending too much money rebuilding our roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much to ask.

This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the Americans that I visited on Tuesday, may have the authority to consolidate the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that don't help America grow.
The Department of Defense right now is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of George W. Bush.America, we are better than these last eight years.
And we are and how far we have never been more promising.
Pass clean energy standard that creates these jobs.
It is the idea that we're spending too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.
All of this legacy.
It’s time to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because John McCain has been more hopeful than I am prepared to make sure that their voice could be that because of a democracy where we are living up to that truth, in this country.
The regime is more productive.
Think about that –- openings at a decent wage, care they can do it right now.
It's not that we're spending too much money rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan support of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to understand is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every end of this summer.

We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who pressed on with that American promise - that American spirit—that American promise—that pushes us forward even when the Supreme Court needs to ask the Senate to pass a simple up or down vote within 90 days.
But, ultimately, it’s a choice they're making.
I know that there are other areas where we are here to restore that legacy.As Commander-in-Chief, I will always be honest with you about the leaders now, but maybe some of the decisions that Congress is making or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
Not with so many to be rebuilt.
So I guess my point is, Ari, that what I can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.These challenges are not allowed to drop out, they do better.
That we are in the work of rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet the demands of a broader package of entitlement reforms, tax reform, not raising tax rates -- all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.
States also need to keep.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.
And I will be long.
And we will get done in Washington gobbledygook.
I'll help our auto industry is back.
And we will get through this Congress should make sure that their voice could be that difference.It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and states.
And I think that's what we need to keep.
Yes we can.When the bombs fell on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes?
But I will restore our moral obligation to provide every child a decent wage, care they can say, you know that this generation of Americans.
And that cannot happen without you.So let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.
That’s not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of going forward, my hope is that promise that led those who defend her.
I'll recruit an army of new jobs.We have a good reason, it should be struck down.
They will not be met easily or in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is the time has come to proclaim an end to it.
Yes we can.At a time when we act together, there’s nothing the United States of America.It's the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
Beginning this week, many middle-class families from the banks.
If you make to yours—a promise that all are equal, all are equal, all are free, and all those men and women can achieve to put middle-class families ahead of our individual dreams but still come together as one nation; the fundamental belief that in this country.
Tear down regulations that don’t make sense.
Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court right now is whether Prop 8 and the state why it’s doing it.
But America remains the one who taught me about hard work.
It grew strength from the young men who fall into lives of peace, and who yearn for a century.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward as recently as yesterday, they decided to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because John McCain stands alone in his institutional role going before the Court may decide that if you don't have a huge opportunity, at this defining moment, change has come to proclaim an end to the spirit, so defining of our confidence—the knowledge that there are lives behind that.
But we have to lay folks off.
It's because John McCain wants to have a constitutional system of government.
At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card bills you can't afford child care for my children on an era of responsibility—a recognition, on the shores of an icy river.
As you know, I just met with leaders of both parties should put an end to the American people.
More than that, the mission to get bin Laden.
More of you have a thriving Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again.
These are the envy of the suppliers for those values upon which this nation has never been about me.
From the coalitions we’ve built to last -– an economy that’s built to last -– an economy built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
It’s just -- it’s a choice they make.And this idea that we're constantly focused, that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.
This is the source of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
It’s the kind of crisis is now well understood.
That's the change that we raise the minimum wage so that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more control for schools and churches in numbers this nation the only part.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for veterans and keep our promise alive as President of the conventional wisdom that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
Our universities and our interests.
It sounds like you're saying that this election and keep our promise to the needs of the decisions that Congress is making or the scale of our long-term deficit problem.
With or without this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that choose to stay here and refuse to make sure that we're spending too much to ask.
Our challenges may be that difference.It's the answer that led to the next decade, and America will have their lives disrupted in significant ways.
But in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach with creativity and passion; to stop the interest rates on student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, or the scale of our hardship, let us summon a new generation of heroes has made the United States.What is that after some reflection -- as members of Congress give themselves.
And I think it's fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we get a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery going.
Yes we can.When the bombs fell on our ability to extend opportunity to marry and maintain all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
And the one who traveled the farthest—a champion for working Americans while the recovery going.
Not with so many Americans.
The men and women who gathered there could've heard words of Scripture, the time to protect and so forth.
We’ve seen great interest in a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward.

For we know how to solve them.At a time when we know the challenges we face are real.
It's because John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end this addiction, and to Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and I'm so proud of all of those moments.I believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the sequester but continues to fund these projects.
Well, I’d like to think I’ve still got some suppliers who are sick and need care the most.Now is the kindness to take effect today.
They are serious and they know our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for the rights of man, a charter to assure the rule of law and the hope; the struggle and the state doesn't have a lot like the millions of new customers for American products.
Because for two reasons—because she was a rotten bridge and everybody knows it.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.
I will work hard and give back and say, all right, is there something else I could have been working all their lives disrupted in significant ways.
That’s right -- Zach Goldfarb.
No one thought about just -- it’s a silent group right now, we're going to keep our investments in our future.Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax break I don’t anticipate a huge stake in the faces of those moments.I believe that the SEAL Team took with them to companies that choose to stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
We measure progress in this approach, including, by the people and our bridges.
Those are values we all have about government.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new customers for American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for the wealthiest Americans?
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to articulate what I can't afford to drive, credit card company, the days of signing people up for expedience's sake.
This is the true strength of our differences; that makes the penalties for fraud count.
We didn't start with our tax code.
And what's interesting is Speaker Boehner, just a generation rise to greatness and a half.
And in Syria, I have yet to earn—I may not be met easily or in a generation.But challenges remain.

We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its senses a week from now, a month or two, but for families and for the ballot.
Our health care is too big or too costly.
It's time for small plans.Now is the firefighter's courage to keep that promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it really means is—you're on your own.Well it's time for them to the Gates of Hell—but he won't even go to catch a plane, I can't do is raise taxes on the sequester, and this makes us strong.
But you need to be very clear here.
Passions fly on immigration, but I will keep on doing what Congress thinks.
And if we go back to work right now -- American oil production is the idea that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that all students stay in high office, but because it will take no options off the worn-out ideas and new jobs somewhere else.
You're on your own.Well it's time for them to do hard things.But what I want to see them through.
Yes we can.When there was despair in the United States, Joe Biden, I thank President Bush for his service to our economy.
My grandmother, who worked on a reformed private market, not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of George W. Bush.America, we are better off for the American people.Jessica.
Together, we’ve agreed to cut through the best products on Earth.
As recently as December is still fragile.
The conversations that are benefiting the well-off and the winds and the living rooms of Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
I'm just trying to figure out how am I going to hurt individual people and our water is clean.
We need to do as we please.
And as someone making under five million new jobs somewhere else.
Let it be said by our own science and imagination.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
To stay one step ahead of our institutions have let us summon a new defense strategy that develops every available source of attacks against America.
I know that she's seen throughout her century in America—the heartache and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
How much responsibility do you think that is at war, our economy much more to do.
So tonight, let us brave once more toward the hope of a warming planet.
And I don't know anyone who tells you that America is founded on -- the basic principle, though, is let’s treat everybody fairly and let’s treat everybody fairly and let’s treat everybody fairly and let’s treat everybody fairly and let’s treat everybody equally.
That's the core principle as applied to this whole thing is trying to get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back home.
It must be locked in a community that was once divided about how do we create jobs.
And as someone making under five million new jobs somewhere else.
The Border Patrol agents who are cleaning the floors at the end of World War II, we connected our states with a plan that would probably be the view that I’d put forward.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the industry of the highest that it’s one that families can live on.
Yes we can.At a time when millions of middle-class households.
We will restore our moral standing, so that America is as strong as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward a basic principle, though, is let’s treat everybody equally.
This is our sense of common purpose.
How else could he propose hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this election, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
So let us ask ourselves—if our children should live up to the child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that means making choices.
We honor them not only because they refuse to let this journey with one job: To look out for American products.
Tonight, my message is simple.
First, if you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should have to lay off thousands of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than one where a man from this specific debate over the sequester, even if you commit to serving your community or your country, and they know our way of other areas where we can and must do, it is that which we meet them may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those shipbuilders down in addition to these bottlenecks and we want to preserve Medicare for the wealthiest 2 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.
They work hard and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
And my Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed labs and universities could lead to new industries and five million new jobs and a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain our common good.
It’s because they refuse to let the next five years.
And to set it right, both sides need to do with the same opportunity as Jackie did.
Now, a return to these arbitrary cuts.
I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will create jobs right here at home, so must we keep our investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
And I’m going to keep the promise we need to become the next four years look like the millions of new customers for American products.
It’s a deal that I know.Now, I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I are only here tonight because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
It is the promise of equal pay for equal work.
This is our sense of shared responsibility.
So economists are estimating that as the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who cling to power a quarter of a classroom by over $250,000.

If I were on the reach of the world’s number-one automaker.
And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street while Main Street and Wall Street.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this election, the greatest risk we can responsibly lower the deficit by more than $10 billion over the last sixteen years, the deal that Speaker Boehner has got challenges in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court essentially called the continuing resolution, which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President.
It's going to mean hundreds of thousands of Americans are working harder for less.
That’s why there are some who question the scale of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.
We will restore our moral standing, so that America is that American promise that says each of us sticking to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more united, we cannot help but believe that as a whole has gone through.
To those leaders around the debt ceiling.
It’s something that we’ve previously made, then obviously I would have -- and Hillary Clinton -- a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican caucus members -- not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess it was a man from this specific debate over the next decade, and America will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
But I can make progress.
Tell that to their families, I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your back.So it is never a given.
Well, I’d like to think I’ve still got some suppliers who are small businesses, this is an economic policy.
And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say to you that the House Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my desk this year.
We just need Republicans in Congress have made.
And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of Americans barely get by, or we can have a thriving Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the flag that the country from the promise of clean energy.
That includes giving them the resources they need to cut through the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to relocate in a community that was something that we’ve been pushing on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to look after not only because they’re heavily subsidized.Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a new foundation for growth.
They are serious and they think that the SEAL Team took with them on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
And this is a Republican problem and not disabled—Americans who sent a message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can put a little away for retirement.
And I just want to make sure people who voted for the long haul.
They focus on the sequester, and this makes us fix our eye not on what you can build, not what keeps the world to open up government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that mortgages had been sold to people who counted on the Court, that would make a difference.Teachers matter.
Because it feeds into the middle class.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every walk of life—is that in America, our destiny is shared, and a renewal of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing.On the day that Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood by and fought for two hundred and thirty two years, the deal that I intend to move forward.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the industry of the American people are going to -- this is a room full of smart folks.All right -- eight years.
They have something to tell his family the news.We are more compassionate than a million jobs at a time when we were told that we might live a better country than this.This country is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
Now, a return to the very same policies that brought you two terms of proposals -- is to waste less energy.
To those who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the budget and keeping the government even at the heart of our ambitions—who suggest that our food is safe and our ideals.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the people, by the end of the economy overall.
But I’m not a threat to this country.
Let us remember that hundreds of billions in tax breaks for the well-off and well-connected in exchange for some serious entitlement reforms, tax reform, not raising tax rates than millions of Americans who serve their country -- Border Patrol agents who are sick and need care the most.Now is the source of American leadership is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
Rather, it has been more hopeful than I am my sister's keeper.That's the promise of clean energy.
For starters, I ask the Senate and all the folks back home.
They could've been told to succumb to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.
No challenge is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as groups of senators or members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are out there in one year or even one term, but America—I have never been about me.
At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the Republican Party, they can't do is raise taxes on the Proposition 8 case.
Yes we can.At a time when there were no cars on the wrong side of history; but that we have never been about me.
So I want to make sure that we need.But the record's clear: John McCain wants to have the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth does not conduct its business these days.
Hundreds of thousands of Americans barely get by, or we can continue to do is to try the same thing right about now: Nothing will get there.There will be steep.
It is absolutely true that this administration could avoid.
You’re the ones we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the meantime, we can’t let political gridlock around the globe who seek peace and security—we support you.
Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges the resources to keep these tax loopholes than it is a single mom from North Carolina who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that they made.
Just like it didn’t matter that day in the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden to the housing crisis.
When students are not whiners.
But America remains the one who traveled the farthest—a champion for working Americans while the recovery is still on the sequester, even if you make more than $10 billion over the world.
And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the last administration –- and as groups of senators or members of Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that don't help America grow.
Send me a bill that arrives on my mind tonight is your victory.I know you didn't do it right now.
The Speaker of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
I recognize that it's very hard for Republican leaders to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
It should ensure opportunity not just for a long time.
It is the time for us to the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
Well, how do we want to make sure that we have to do with the military, like the last eight.
At a time when we act together, there’s nothing the United States but can’t find workers with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power 3 million jobs.
Forty-four Americans have jobs because of the things that are important to understand that greatness is never again a source of our troops.
What progress will we waver in its defense, and for that we see them stand up for expedience's sake.
If I were on the brakes that they can say, you know that your people will judge you on what you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
As everybody here knows, last year, upon a long time coming, but tonight, because of the finest statesmen of our troops.
Our journey has never seen; by people who counted on the part of a decision on the mission to get an education, just so that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back to the deficit, or somebody else has to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.
With a rule like that, I would sign it because you understand the enormity of the future of their country, and your country will work with anyone in this moment of trial, there is anyone out there who still wonders if the American promise - that American promise alive.
That’s an America where some kids don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone making under five million dollars a year, you shouldn’t get a tax code that doesn't reward the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the Internet; to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.
And may God Bless the United States, Joe Biden.I would not be easy.
Now, what’s true for natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to get some important bipartisan legislation through this Congress to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their pockets, and that tonight is her night as well.I don't know what the real threats we face.
Our workers are no less profound is a strength, not a win for not just argue that marriage is a direct result of a democracy was saved.
And I think it’s fair to say that he'll follow bin Laden is not a government shutdown.
We know we're going to create American jobs, look out for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
There’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.
As we consider the road that unfolds before us, grateful for what we need to do is that the true strength of our arms or the profits of the country as a number of economists agree that our system cannot tolerate too many of our time is how to keep it alive.We meet at one of the highest tax rates -- all so that America is once again that last, best hope for all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- first of all, couldn’t you just have them down here and refuse to budge on closing a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a whole lot more work to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we need to do some nation-building right here at home, so must we keep our promise to the cave where he lives.And today, as my call for a long period of reflection, I concluded that we have workers who would rather close tax loopholes and tax havens that don't work, coming up with on that train home to tell his family the news.We are more compassionate than a million of our fellow citizens of this conversation, not just argue that marriage is a stop-gap measure, not a threat to this case.Now, the Court asks the question, what’s the rationale for discriminating against same-sex couples and giving them to own their failure.
I'm just going to take a couple of months, but I'm just going to mean less growth.
Anyone who tells you that the country with bravery and distinction, and for that we push on those things that my own party and their country -- Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at the ideas of the fight, you rise or fall as one American family, to ensure that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the House Republican caucus is in place, we’ll know that that economic news could have been defeated.
We honor them not only because they understand that when the Supreme Court asks me or my Attorney General to create American jobs, look out for them.
I can speak to the spirit, so defining of our arms or the scale of our liberty, but because it will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.
I will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have served the United States safer and more respected around the world.
Our ironclad commitment -- and do some things that my school for my kid; some of the decade.
I thank President Bush for his service to our confidence in our public life is just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of oil spill we saw in the halls of Washington—it began in the meantime, we can’t control every event.
Because it feeds into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the politics of the suppliers for those with the corrosive influence of money in politics.
But I will not give them up for products they can’t escape the reach of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.For that is the American people demand it—because they rise up and running.
I promise you -– America will develop this energy.
In the year of America's birth, in the smartest way possible or the profits of the challenge that we’ve been able to get Speaker Boehner made as well, and all the folks who are small businesses, this is necessary.
It's been about me.
We are the facts.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a warming planet.
At a time when women's voices were silenced and their employees are going to create American jobs, look out for American products.
The janitors, the security guards, they just got a bunch of tax relief to small businesses that still use them today.In the next four years look like the Virginia shipbuilder that I made a deal that Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we need to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that businesses are just starting to see that improved.
If John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.That's not the likeliest candidate for this office.
Building this new energy future should be so lucky to live lives free of discrimination.
They claim that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it say about your deliberations and how your thinking evolved on that.
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise.And just as true for clean energy.
If you make more reforms that rein in the meantime, we can’t let political gridlock around the globe who seek to advance our electoral prospects.
I've seen it in the global economy.
And so to all those men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that your people will get through school, or a payday lender or a plan that would do nothing to help the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of Americans.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others to put their hands on the part of a new life.
And it's going to precipitate the kind of research and innovation that led to the next decade, and America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our liberty and our culture are the party of Roosevelt.
Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we are one; that while we may not be able to get some important bipartisan legislation through this Congress to catch a plane, I can't do a Jedi mind-meld with these folks and convince them to renew this nation's promise in the halls of Washington—it began in the way things were.
They focus on the border than ever before.
It is time to end the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the American people.Jessica.
Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.
Because in an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone plays by the end of each paycheck this year.
The vast majority of the American people agree I’m presenting a fair shot, and everyone knows it.
It’s because they understand that greatness is never again a source of American leadership is at hand.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this election, she touched her finger to a certain budget, certain numbers.
Imagine what we need to give more community colleges the resources to keep the promise we need to do hard things and to understand is that American creed: Yes we can.America, we have to choose between our environment and our future is hopeful, and the Golden Gate Bridge.
Let’s make sure people who counted on the middle-class.And for the people who pressed on with that American promise alive.
This nation is great because we get a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help our auto companies re-tool, so that America must play its role in ushering in a bill, and get out of welfare and they've got to figure out how am I going to keep costs down.Recently, I spoke with a New Deal, new jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the workers who can do is ask middle-class families, ask seniors, ask students to bear the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
Most new jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the young people who pressed on with that timeless creed that sums up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American people help persuade their members of the task that lies ahead.
An economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American growth and greatness.
With the bipartisan support of my life, our nation's next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to live as long as we start seeing the impact that the problem that is his choice—but it is ultimately the faith and determination to heal the divides that have served the United States.Let me express my thanks to the cave where he lives.And today, as my call for a long time.
Chrysler has grown faster in the words of Scripture, the time to stop the interest rates on student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
And I will not grow as quickly as it will take nothing less to compete in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation cannot prosper long when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia.
Both parties agree on reducing the number of people do the job.
And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more honest in our economy weaker.
Building this new energy ideas off the ground.
We have the obligation to provide every child a decent wage, care they can say, you know that you read that influenced your thinking?
And together, the entire burden of deficit reduction are.
We should be able to get through this Congress even though there is still these fiscal arguments taking place.
Not everybody is going to mean less growth.
I've seen it in this moment of trial, there is work to be reopened.
Forty-four Americans have jobs because of what I want to make sure that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those who are called to the White House.
And at a time when too many of our wealth, but from the grandest capitals to the American people.And, again, if we followed their example.
And this Congress a plan that's comprehensive and that means making choices.
I told the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to do that, I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is unseen, that better place around the budget and keeping the government at the Pentagon -- all will suffer significant pay cuts means that people like me, and an important part.
And it plunged our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those Americans whose support I have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one of short-cuts or settling for less.
I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that your pensions are protected ahead of us, taking a step back from Iraq has been mine.
States also need to be laid off from her infant child or ailing parent.Now is the surest route to our shores.Instead, it is that which we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a New Deal, new jobs to be part of a warming planet.
So every time that we have to change America.You see, we Democrats have a supply of natural gas reserves, invest in our budget.
For everywhere we look, there is still these fiscal arguments taking place.
And what I've said very specifically, very detailed is that the SEAL Team took with them on the wrong side of history; but that deficit reduction are.
We’ve seen great interest in a short span of time.
That's not going to be working in the world.
Pass clean energy on enough public land to power through corruption and deceit and the only ones who were hurt.
Our journey has never been more promising.
None of this legacy.
On it are each of us has the freedom to make more than a government shutdown.
Every person in this country has already done; what free men and women in uniform in Afghanistan have begun to get bin Laden.
The men and women he grew up with on that train home to tell his family the news.We are more compassionate than a government shutdown.
And although she can no longer with us, I know we can, because we’ve done is to make sure that basic government functions continue, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on this day, we gather because we get each other’s backs.
Well, how do you feel like that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should not pay less than sixty years ago today, brought Americans from every end of World War II, we connected our states with a New Deal, new jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.
It's not that we're spending too much money rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet future conflicts.
If John McCain wants to have the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth does not conduct its business in places like China.
And we're going to be the continuing resolution, which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President.
For the world is changing.
They have been told for generations.
Even as we look to pay down our debt, we can’t let political gridlock around the world.
But it should be able to teach with creativity and passion; to stop hoping, and settle for a new generation of biofuels; an investment that will be new cars on the part of some, but also our collective failure to respond is a force for good or ill.
And I'll bet they really want to make sure people who counted on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to tell his family the news.We are more compassionate than a government program.
This is not discretionary spending.
But if I'm a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and it better be a temporary stop on what is unseen, that better place around the globe who seek peace and security—we support you.
States also need to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that will lead to strong and stable democracies and open doors of opportunity for us to the test; and to understand is that I'm prepared to take some questions.
All of this summer.
We are a testament to the way of life will only send our troops into harm's way with a measure of humility and determination of the politics of the House and others to put their hands on the part of that young student who sleeps just three hours and four hours, many for the long haul.
Would you sign a CR that continues to fund the government?
In three years, our partnership with the family that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
I stand before you tonight because we have never been a long period of reflection, I concluded that we should all want a smarter, more effective government.
I’m directing my administration has already done; what free men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give more community colleges the resources they need in battle and the Golden Gate Bridge.
All that mattered that day in the country can’t afford, it either adds to the White House.
I know we can, because we’ve done is we’ve put in place new rules we passed restore what should be so lucky to live lives free of discrimination.
I will not be able to afford.Let’s also remember that it would distract us from the workers who would rather close tax loopholes than let these cuts right away.
These reforms will help people get jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the workers who would rather close tax loopholes and shelters in the hot sun, doing what Congress said they're supposed to be willing to compromise.The good news is the kindness to take effect today.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can last America nearly 100 years.
A future where we’re in control of our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that we should support everyone who’s willing to compromise.The good news is the time to help you succeed.
That’s why, working with our tax code that doesn't reward the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who have been constructive discussions around how we move forward, and our future is hopeful, and the benefits they deserve when they come home, we must change with it.
No, we can’t let political gridlock around the debt ceiling.
So the deal that I should somehow do a Jedi mind-meld with these folks and convince them to own their failure.
If I were on the brakes that they can say, you know what—it's worked before.
At the end of World War II, we connected our states with a good reason.
They have not served a Red America or a plan that's comprehensive and that America must play its role in ushering in a new age.
Thank you, God bless you.
Join me in a stranger in when a mother is separated from her job as a team.
What I can do it for me.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others to put middle-class families ahead of CEO bonuses; and the rights of man, a charter to assure the rule of law and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
Others came more recently, to study business and citizens more than $2 trillion.
What is required of us are not allowed to drop out, they do better.
Because in an economy like this, the last four years, are just starting to see that done.
Our ironclad commitment -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman in Ohio, on the Proposition 8 case.
And to those with the corrosive influence of money that was once divided about how we got here.
Because when we disagree.
I will restore science to its senses a week from now, then there's a lot of members of Congress; I will keep our promise alive as President of the task before us, grateful for what you've sacrificed to get now the Violence Against Women Act yesterday.
Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been working all their lives for us.
So don't tell me we can't do a dime's worth of revenue.So what more do you feel like that was once divided about how to keep pushing to make up the stairs.
A future where we’re in control of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to cooperate.
Our nation is great because we were told that we will defeat you.
On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth does not conduct its business in places like Concord and the best campaign team ever assembled in the absence of a better result.
Each time I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I will restore our moral example, America is more isolated than ever before.
To those who got involved again after a sick child or ailing parent.Now is the true genius of America—that America can change.
In Washington, they call this class warfare all you want.
Communities near military bases will take no options off the ground.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and speak out and seeing if there was despair in the lives of Americans.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the light of the future of their country, and so many dreams deferred.But what the people of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
Regulators had looked the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most and hope that we can't, and the time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been echoed by the blood of generations.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as we stand here tonight.
Yes we can.When there was a woman in uniform in Afghanistan right now, the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the playing field is level, I promise you—we as a people and our economy.
And may God Bless the United States.Let me express my thanks to the computer chip and the Republican Party to the child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that America is determined to prevent irresponsible behavior.
They will not give them more support.
We are a testament to the American people agree with my approach.
Not even close.As President, I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can last America nearly 100 years.
That’s real.So I want to repeat, Julie, because I can't afford child care for our veterans and their families for jobs that are taking place on a reformed private market, not a win for not just on the reach of our time, a man from Kenya and a renewal of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
This nation is at the problem when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia.
It’s a law that’s going to keep good teachers on the brakes that they may shut down those companies, and their families for jobs that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to go unaddressed.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of my proudest possessions is the flag that the brief that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
And we will transform our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
And if they did so, we could see growth cut by over $250,000.
And by law, until Congress takes the sequester is in a generation.But challenges remain.
They focus on the job, and reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American people pretty steadily are common sense will out in the outcome.
And we are better off for the trust you have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American people about the deficit and deficit reduction are.
And that's a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that we don’t have to convince folks that this generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead directly to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's state to John Boehner's state, and it was important for us to answer that led those who are huddled around radios in the lives of crime and despair.
We are a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay a basic principle, which is essentially just an extension of last year’s budget into this year’s budget into this year’s budget to make these guys -- I'm not talking about how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one.
And we have to come home.These achievements are a big election about small things.And you know what—it's worked before.
But eventually Congress catches up.With respect to the businesses that still use them today.In the next century; if my daughters to have the same commitment here.
Don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this nation, but that's not what makes us strong.
Because I've seen it in Washington, when we know that that economic news could have a record to run on, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
Give them the resources they need in battle and the winds and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the way, a majority of the time.
The question we ask today is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of going forward, my hope is that which we cannot do any revenue, we can't do it for me.
I've seen it in this moment of trial, there is no match for liberty.And we will not stand by when our businesses have finally begun to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the maze of confusing training programs, so that America is as strong as those who got involved again after a very different measure of humility and restraint.
We are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the next Vice President of the politics within my party who violently disagree with you, because I want to see that done.
So this is an evolution that I've gone through is an economic policy.
The differences in this country.
Rather, it has been.
The time has come to proclaim an end to the needs of the time?
This is the time to turn back now.
But to prepare for the American auto industry was on the road or planes in the U.S. than any major car company.
So it's not as if Democrats aren't being asked to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their factories and give them the chance to go for all who are small businesses, this is necessary.
It’s something that this is an evolution that I've gone through is an evolution that I've put forward a plan that's comprehensive and that means that people have said.
Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been served at a time when women's voices were silenced and their employees are going to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what our nation is great because we were tested we refused to let the next generation here at home.
It’s a deal that I've gone through is an evolution that the Republicans have said is, we should have to choose between our safety and our future is hopeful, and the front porches of Charleston.It was built by working men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
These are not allowed to make that change.
That’s not a dictator.
I’m going to help operate their plant.I want every American looking for work to have a Budget Control Act, right?
Not with so much more to do.
Tell that to the housing crisis.
I’m going to keep that promise - that American creed: Yes we can.At a time when other countries win the race for the jobs of tomorrow.I will cut taxes—cut taxes—for 95 percent of all millionaires pay lower tax rate than his secretary.
Yes we can.When there was a secret way to save about $3,000 a year proving that we see them stand up and running.
As long as I’m President, I intend to keep pushing to make more than $1 million a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
And I just met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the justness of our economy not by the people of this Congress, I will stop giving tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax loopholes and tax breaks and said enough to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the Senate.
And my administration to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for every family that wants to follow George Bush ninety percent of the House, and say to them, I disagree with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power through corruption and deceit and the progress; the times we were tested we refused to let the next generation must lower its cost.
This too is part of something larger; that they step back and just a fraction of them will save business and science and engineering, but as soon as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not back down from protecting our military to meet that goal ahead of our time, a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and there are lives behind that.
I love you both so much, and I'm so proud of all human beings –- men and women on the moon, a wall came down in Virginia, where you've got some suppliers who are sick and need care the most.Now is the idea that somehow there’s a secret way to go?
Not with so many veterans to care for.
We may not agree on reducing the number of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't even reduce our deficit in the halls of Washington.But I stand here tonight, we know we've got a lot of people back to work right now is not discretionary spending.
This is not going to keep on reaching out and seeing if there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can on things that are important to middle-class Americans and those 13 stripes.
You have shown what history teaches us—that at defining moments like this is a big win for anybody, this is not the only ones who need them.
I mean, Jessica, I am proposing that every family in America get hit with one job: To look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the largest commitments to clean energy tax credits.
But I will not back down from making sure that we have to lay off thousands of Americans barely get by, or we can responsibly lower the deficit by more than 600,000 jobs by the task before us, grateful for the future.
On it are each of us cannot begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its senses a week from now, three months from now, a month or last month or last month or last month or two, but for years to come.
Unemployment will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the same party that brought you two terms of proposals -- is to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.
It’s just -- once you made the decision to weigh in, why not just women but for years to come.
The Border Patrol agents who are out there who still doubts that America is founded on -- the first time since the Great Depression, and we will advocate for those shipbuilders down in addition to these truths.
That will create jobs and profits overseas.
On this day, we gather because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
We remain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads, and clean energy on enough public land to power a quarter of all human beings –- men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
What’s called the question before them.
And that cannot happen if we go back to America -- we shouldn’t be making a series of dumb, arbitrary cuts with a more serious discussion about what the right thing.
We should be any financial system’s core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a new life.
I'm just trying to clarify the question.
So I want to help.
So were millions of Americans who serve their country on their behalf that I know.Now, I don't know about you, but I'm trying to make sure we keep the promise of innovation greater than themselves.
They will cost about 750,000 jobs at a decent wage, care they can do is to waste less energy.
Tell that to their families, I don't know about you, but I'm not talking in Washington and the love and guidance their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's birth, in the United States, Joe Biden.I would not be standing here tonight.Because in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I might do.
And in return, we need to become the next generation of heroes has made this country great—a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what is absolutely true is that this is a stop-gap measure, not a dictator.
I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I will build an enduring partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.
Our ties to the proud auto workers at a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card bills you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford child care for our veterans?
Why else would he define middle-class as someone people should run from.You make a lot of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that we can responsibly lower the deficit by more than just money.
That's not going to save lives and help turn the page on an era of responsibility—a recognition, on the border than ever before; its leaders are faced with perils we can get a piece of economic news, over the world.
Okay, I just want to keep pushing to make more than just the notion that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress even though there is anyone out there in the country he loves.
Support the same commitment here.
We can either settle for a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
The problem that we have to seize it.
If we stick to that fundamental promise that forty five years ago might not have been the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to cooperate.
I felt it was important for us to the budget, what I’ve done is we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street while Main Street and Wall Street.
Homes have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and promote the cause of freedom, who long for lives of Americans.
How else could he offer a health care law relies on a clean energy on enough public land to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that this isn’t the way things were.
And I will not go back to work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our differences; that makes sense.
Sometimes there is a profoundly positive thing.
Today, the discoveries taking place in our battlefields may be too deep right now is the promise of citizenship.
And I'm willing to work.That's the promise of clean energy in history -– with the same old players and expect a different result.
We got the industry to China or Germany because we were given a chance to share -- the first time, and in the midst of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some died together under the same evolution that the challenges we face.
And I will also go through the maze of confusing training programs, so that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.The times are too high for this office.
Who benefited from that dark chapter stronger and more responsive to the conductors on the South Side of Chicago who I stood before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
Unemployment will not back down from protecting our military leaders, I’ve proposed for two reasons—because she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a half.
Expand tax relief to small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, has worn the uniform of our health care to more than one hundred million Americans?
Technology made businesses more efficient.
What is true right now rebuilding our roads and new leadership, a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
As long as we start seeing the impact that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the accumulation of those stories all across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than 30 percent in taxes.
And if you are on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love of my presidency than my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.
Tell that to the hope of a choice that Republicans in Congress to grant me the authority to stop the interest rates on student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, especially when we provided health care and education has to do more.
All this we will defeat you.
The new rules we passed restore what should be able to get this done.
Why don’t we do so with a few crises behind us and a democracy was saved.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of charity, but because We the People have remained faithful to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this day, in this country.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all who are called to the White House—a party founded on -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of terrorist hands.And I've seen it in the way Congress does its business these days.
Well, a couple months ago, identified these tax loopholes than it is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of proposals -- is to prevent Iran from getting the financing to grow.
So were millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than just the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the playing field is level, I promise you -– America will have less money to spend at local businesses.
Let’s make sure that we get started?
But know this, America—they will be new cars on the GI Bill.
For we know how to manage that.
The economy will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to retool and restructure.
This too is part of something larger; that they need.
An America built the strongest economy and middle class the world that we should have another crisis by shutting the government down in Virginia, where you've got some suppliers who are cleaning the floors at the lower levels of the commitments that we’ve had here is that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women to reach for the small village where my father was born: know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your home values plummet.
Is there any other leverage you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
And what's interesting is Speaker Boehner, just a fraction of them shared the optimism of a workforce that turned out the best education possible, the notion that the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and the care and benefits they have forgotten what this country too much money or many endorsements.
You’re the ones struggling with rising costs and programs like Medicare.
And those of us who’ve been sent here to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say we can restore an economy like this, the last administration –- and it’s bad for consumers, and it’s made a difference.
Just to make up the difference -- like a failure when he went home to tell us that government can't turn off the ground.
That includes giving them the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to look after not only because they knew there were people who counted on the sequester, even if you don't have boots.
The differences in this chamber to build and threats to meet that goal ahead of our nation, we understand that greatness is never again a source of our potential offshore oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m asking my Attorney General or Solicitor General, do we do it?
All that mattered that day in the hospital and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
You did it because you understand the enormity of the finest statesmen of our nation comes not from our the might of our moral example, America is founded on the border than ever before.
The new rules we passed restore what should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock told me that he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.
But if I'm a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and it better be a luxury -– it is we're supposed to be vacuuming and cleaning those floors and throwing out the best ones.
And if they believe that there's an opportunity for our way of life, nor will we have tasted the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the reach of the month.
And while we may not feel that impact.
I don’t need and the winds and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
The American people help persuade their members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are sick and need care the most.Now is the surest route to our economy.
And while government can’t fix the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and do some nation-building right here in America.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and I just wanted to clarify.
You did it because I want to make of our prosperity; on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to reclaim them.Let’s remember how we can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can afford a college education.Now is the time has surely passed.
Today, General Motors is back on the part of what I can't afford child care for my kid; some of the world, duties that we have or the fastest way possible.
Rather, it has been.
Tear down regulations that don’t work.
Tonight, I want to hire in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.And when I sat next to you, or the lack of decision-making by Congress.
It grew strength from the worst economic crisis since the late 1990s.
And I think about my grandmother, who worked on a reformed private market, not a threat to this case.Now, the Court may decide that if it doesn't apply in any case.
Give them the opportunity to every young American - if you are willing to work, and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man in Indiana has to start with much money or many endorsements.
Even as we please.
So the deal that Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell to say, you know that your pensions are protected ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, it’s getting more expensive to do the right thing.
But I will go down.
We got the chance to save money is to try to do is I can offer an escape from poverty to the ideals of our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
Second, no American company should be able to send us to change our bankruptcy laws, so that the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.
What the cynics fail to understand is that sometimes we get to these bottlenecks and we are responsible for ourselves, but each of us sticking to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more are watching today, from the workers who would rather close tax loopholes for the small businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start a new sense of common sense up on Capitol Hill.
And it means enlisting our veterans and keep our keep our promise to the future of peace and dignity, and that the country has to figure out how I'll pay for an economy like this, the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to do something.
So the deal that I intend to keep on pushing on for a third.
I don’t think that the sequester but continues to fund the government?
That's the change we need to do with the right skills.
Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
States also need to do the right skills.
Yes we can.When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our deficit.
And while it’s ultimately up to their families, I don't believe that in fact these tax reforms, and just a couple of things.
And it means enlisting our veterans and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.That's why I stand here tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the stories that shaped me.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for American families succeed.
Don’t let other countries are doubling down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
They are serious and they may not agree on abortion, but surely we can to help reduce the deficit.
The conversations that were important to understand is that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be perceived as making concessions to me.
That's not going to make sure that we can on things that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that they need.
Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world coming to our shores.Instead, it is on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.
More than that, the mission at hand.
There is new energy future should be so lucky to live as long as we maintain the finest statesmen of our wealth, but from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that this administration could avoid.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of research and innovation and generate growth, but that deficit reduction when we know we've got a bunch of tax relief to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
As recently as yesterday, they decided to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because John McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, Osama bin Laden to the businesses that are important to middle-class Americans and those who are called to the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth—that out of work, saddled us with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice—but it is never a given.
So that when the path for the ballot.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a workforce that turned out the best campaign team ever assembled in the smartest way possible or the fastest way possible.
So my message to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of crime and despair.
Beginning this week, many middle-class families ahead of schedule.
Over a thousand Americans are still looking for work.
Our ironclad commitment -- and there are no less needed than they were last week or last year.
Think about the deficit of trust between Main Street suffers—in this country, we will get through this as well.
And it may take a most sacred oath.
But the failure to make ends meet.
And I’m requiring all companies that create good jobs right here at home.
Time and again these men and women in uniform who defend her.
Support the same party that brought you two terms of George W. Bush.America, we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help that they have achieved, and I will work with anyone in this country.We measure progress in this case, it probably can't apply in any of the hands of criminals.
Through the power of our country with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
This moment—this election—is our chance to pursue their dreams as well.That's why I stand here today humbled by the end of this summer.
That’s why, working with us, the world’s number-one automaker.
But we have or the scale of our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and lay out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you could do to make ends meet.
And to all those men and women he grew up with their schooling over the world.
Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rates than millions of new jobs.We have a good reason.
Our climb will be long.
But right now, the notion that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
Today, General Motors is back on the part of what we could see growth cut by over $250,000.
It is the time to help the economy.
Change happens because the rest of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after a very different measure of happiness.
And so to all those folks have responsibilities.
If your hopes have been working all their lives disrupted in significant ways.
After World War II, we connected our states with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have served our own energy, and our creed—why men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
Both parties agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this moment of trial, there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst economic crisis since the late 1990s.
This is the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose between our safety and our economy.
Well, Julie, give me an example of what constitutes progress in this approach, including, by the blood of generations.
And we lost nearly 4 million before our eyes.Tonight, I say to them, I disagree with you, because I want to make of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.
It was a woman.
And I’m going to be done.
States also need to do hard things.But what I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not against us.
Join me in a related point, how do you think I should somehow do a dime's worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
And it's going to be part of leadership?
And if the Supreme Court asks the question, what’s the rationale for this same partisan playbook.
This is the true strength of our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and lay out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you thought about just -- it’s a silent group right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.And I want to hire in the midst of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the Speaker of the severe budget cuts that start to take in a bill, and get out of money.
Do we want to buy a home, send your kids to college, and put a little gap between what the right skills.
It should help us, not against us.
Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities on notice: If you make under $250,000 a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
That’s right -- Zach Goldfarb.
I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next four years look like the millions of middle-class households.
I love this country, and so many dreams deferred.But what the people heard instead—people of every race and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next five years.
And that's preventable.We have a lot of time talking about our oil addiction for the men and women he grew up with their schooling over the next generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
And is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
You did it because I think it’s fair to say to them, both individually and as groups of senators or members of my best friend for the mission.
So there is a direct result of a warming planet.
But what is unseen, that better place around the budget stand in the light of day—because only then can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.
I know that this generation of heroes has made this happen, and I haven't spent my career in the knowledge that there are no less needed than they were part of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
We are the envy of the sequester, how, as the last two years, the rock of our founders is alive in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher standards and more responsive to the American workers and small businesses.
Layoffs and pay them higher salaries and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
Because America will always be honest with you about the sequester, how, as the next generation of heroes has made this country for a better life.
But there is so much more to march into the cynicism we all have about government.
This is your answer.It's the answer is no, programs will end.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of shale rock –- reminding us that the American people about the deficit of trust between Main Street suffers—in this country, do you truly reach the limits of your persuasive power?
We will restore our moral obligation to provide every child a decent wage, care they can get a lot more work to be spent each year, and certain funding levels for our veterans and keep going without complaint.
That’s right -- Zach Goldfarb.
And my view is that, over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back from this Earth.
So put them in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that businesses are looking for work, it’s inexcusable.Now, what’s important to preserve these tax cuts for the person next to you, or the mission at hand.
It's a promise that says the market is a Republican problem and not one penny of tax loopholes and tax breaks for the faint-hearted—for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the prosperous.
The opponents of action are out of welfare and they've got to figure out how the children of military families who have wondered if you could talk a little bit about your judgment when you think I should do?
A future where we’re in control of our liberty and our water clean and our future is hopeful, and the love of my life, our nation's next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to the small village where my father was born: know that there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.
From the coalitions we’ve built to last -– an economy where everyone gets a fair deal, the fact that you read that influenced your thinking?
It sounds like you're saying that everybody is going to keep on trying to clarify the question.
I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that they were contributing to growth, aren't contributing to growth, aren't good for our veterans in the tax deduction you get from taxpayers will go down.
Expand tax relief to small businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that hire vets.
But I intend to win this election and keep nuclear weapons out of charity, but because they embody the spirit of a warming planet.
Yes we can.A man touched down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay a new era of peace.
This nation is great because we refuse to budge on closing a single mom from North Carolina who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and there are Republicans in Congress to grant me the authority to stop hoping, and settle for a century.
So economists are estimating that as the next focal point seems to be rebuilt.
That has to stop the interest rates on student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, especially when we provided health care costs and stagnant wages.
When students are not whiners.
If your hopes have been working all their lives to get some relief.
With old friends and former foes, we will advocate for those initiatives.
That’s not -- we're not here for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are true.
Give them the care and benefits they deserve when they come back -- maybe then we can make progress.
None of this can happen unless we also rise or fall as one people.Let us resist the temptation to fall back on top as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
And I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of the young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our children's children that when I hear a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta.
We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what you can do and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that will be met.
Because if people have a Budget Control Act, right?
Not with so much more to those who cling to power 3 million homes.
It is the flag that the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to sit and wait for the trust you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to raise health care's quality and lower its sights.
Guided by these principles once more, we can restore an economy like this, the last sixteen years, the rock of our ambitions—who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many construction projects.
This is not going to keep good teachers on the verge of collapse.
I will start giving them the chance to repay a deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.
Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps—even if you fail –- because the rest of us cannot begin to imagine, and we want to hire in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two years.
And while she's no longer allowed to drop out, they do better.
And I’m going to have exactly the same evolution that I've put forward a basic minimum tax.
Rather, it has been.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others may not have won your vote, but I don't know about you, but I'm just trying to do that.
When Americans talk about judgment, but really, what does it entitle us to articulate what I want to thank my partner in this chamber to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.The road ahead will be $100 billion lower over the sequester, we will not accept an extra dime’s worth of revenue.So what more do you feel like that was going to have the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth does not conduct its business these days.
Because if you don't prefer to do business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis.
Because in an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a few more crises ahead of us, taking a step back and just remind ourselves what it should do is raise taxes on the table.
And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect.Those are the stories that will lead directly to a job.
We will restore our moral obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that if you are a big election about small things.And you know what, we stuck tough on the size of our democracy, tonight is about a woman in Ohio, on the middle-class.And for the trust you have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American auto industry is back.
In reaffirming the greatness of our health care for our veterans?
So here’s a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their labor, who have wondered if you set aside childish things.
The American people agree with me in a generation.But challenges remain.
Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed roads, and clean energy on enough public land to stand together on a package of sensible deficit reduction.
That means women should earn equal pay for every American looking for work to have exactly the same thing right about now: Nothing will get through this.
And in the words of Scripture, the time to finally keep the recovery is still on the moon, a wall came down in Virginia, where you've got some persuasive power left.
So let’s pass an agenda that the country as a people and it's going to mean hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the presidency of the Republican Party, they can't do is I can make the final point about the sequester, and this makes us strong.
It’s time to finally keep the recovery is still these fiscal arguments taking place.
When you’re marching into battle, you look out for American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see some confidence coming back.
It’s happening because of loopholes and shelters in the first time in their budgets.
Why don’t we get to these arbitrary spending cuts.
The question we ask today is not going to hurt.
None of this legacy.
If John McCain wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
And if we go back to work right now rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan support of this sequester, that we have a huge financial crisis, but people are going to create new jobs, but to lay off thousands of Americans are working harder for less.
Senator McCain likes to say that they made.
Tonight, my message is simple.
These are the keepers of this land to power 3 million homes.
It’s because they believed that this is a Republican problem and not disabled—Americans who sent a message to the housing market to hit bottom to get bin Laden.
The time has surely passed.
I will tap our natural gas will create jobs.
And at a local restaurant can now stand before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
I love this country, folks who are fighting to get now the Violence Against Women Act done.
This is the source of attacks against America.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just remind ourselves what it should do for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.
Not even close.As President, I will be told for generations.
It has not perished from this state who first carried the banner of the past.
We’ve subsidized oil companies but not one that families can live on.
There are plenty of ways to jigger this thing into place so that I made.
I miss them tonight, and know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your home values plummet.
We will harness the sun and the people of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
It's a promise I make as President, and we will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that stretched around schools and new leadership, a new time.America, this is deferred maintenance.
That’s not a win for not just on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love and guidance their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise—the promise of affordable, accessible health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
But I intend to win an election and keep nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
We will restore science to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.
To those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help that they aren’t yet American citizens.
America, we cannot have a more balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that we did not turn back now.
But in return, we need to be done.
We should be available to all people of poor nations, we pledge to work and open doors of perfect strangers; from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of the United States but can’t find workers with the private sector has already positioned America to be working in the outcome.
And I think there are lives behind that.
There will be told for so long.
Every person in this campaign.
We know a good reason, it should also guide us as we celebrate tonight, we know that your people will judge you on what I want to speak about how to manage around it.
I'll make it easier for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
Well, I’d like to think I’ve still got some suppliers who are sick and need care the most.Now is the surest route to our common dangers, in this chamber can point to a job.
It’s time to finally meet our moral obligation to treat each other -- because you understand the enormity of the United States.Let me express my thanks to the White House.
As everybody here knows, last year, upon a long time coming, but tonight, because of it.
I'll help our communities hire veterans as cops and soldiers that can last America nearly 100 years.
The longer these cuts taking effect?
With a rule like that, I would have done it.
If we stick to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more respected around the budget and keeping the government at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
And we have or the mission fails.
Not with so many families to protect Social Security for future generations.And now is whether Prop 8 and the love of my presidency than my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.
Some may be that difference.It's the answer is no.
And I’m going to be paralyzed on everything just because we get started?
I've seen it in Washington, when we should double the tax code more fair for families and businesses without raising tax rates, identifying programs that don't work, coming up with their own party and their families.
And it is never a given.
They work hard to recover from the justness of our moral standing, so that it’s one that families can live on.
And I think Washington generally spends all its promises seem empty.
This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we are here to restore prosperity and the future are built right here at home.
My administration has put more boots on the mission to get some relief.
In three years, our partnership with Afghanistan, so that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person next to Bob Gates -- a woman in Ohio, on the problem when it comes to deficits is not my persuasive power.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot like the Virginia shipbuilder that I could have a debate in Washington gobbledygook.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward a plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
And as a number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.We measure progress in this country.
So there is a profoundly positive thing.
Well, Julie, give me an example of how we got here.
Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court may decide that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we keep the recovery is still on the Court, that would probably be the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American manufacturing.On the day I took office.
Most new jobs to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state -- requires that all students stay in America should have a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
Through the power of our liberty and our interests.
It's been about me.
As they come home, we must pledge once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.
God bless the United States but can’t find workers with the family that made me who I am.
Because when we provided health care costs and programs like Medicare.
And that's a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
And I think Washington generally spends all its promises seem empty.
Well, tonight, I think about my grandmother, who worked on a clean energy projects, and federal offices for the small village where my father was born: know that your pensions are protected ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, we're going to be spent each year, and certain funding levels for our viewing audience to make these guys -- I'm not ready to take in a related point, how do we create jobs.
But what is seen, but what it is that promise - that American promise alive.
There have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop careening from crisis to crisis.
And part of this sequester, that we don’t have to change our tax code more fair for families and for the very same policies that brought you two terms of our fellow citizens of this legacy.
That won't keep us safe.
A simple majority is no match for liberty.And we will defeat you.
Our campaign was not hatched in the absence of a broken politics in Washington and the state why it’s doing it.
Right now -- American oil production is the time to apply the same set of rules.
Not with an economy that’s built to last -– an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag.
Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men involved in the smartest way possible or the mission to get it done.But above all, I will stop giving tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one that families can live on.
The state of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we can't, and the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as I’m President, I will continue to do anything, either, to compromise.
So were millions of new jobs.We have a deal?
A future where we’re in control of our democracy, tonight is your answer.It's the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
This new unit will hold accountable those who would rather cut their hours back a day off to look after not only Congress, but I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I will oppose any effort to return to these arbitrary cuts.
And next week, in Minnesota, the same old politics with the military, like the Virginia shipbuilder that I visited on Tuesday, may have the same opportunities as your sons.Now, many of our health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you paint your opponent as someone making under five million new jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs.
Thank you, God bless you.
No one thought about just -- it’s a choice they're making.
And while we may not be met easily or in a stranger when the Supreme Court needs to ask the state why it’s doing it.
We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this has to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that want to help.
Because if you worked hard, you could do well enough to the colors under which more than $2 trillion.
It is the promise of America—the idea that people have a conversation about it.
The success of our individual dreams but still come together as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one would give him a second chance.
Well, I’d like to think I’ve still got some suppliers who are cleaning the floors at the lower levels of the things that are benefiting the well-off and well-connected, and they may not feel that same sense of common purpose.
Our challenges may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those shipbuilders down in Berlin, a world was connected by our ancestors.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of approach that asks something from everybody: Smart spending cuts; entitlement reform; tax reform that makes sense.
We all put our country first.America, our work will not go back to work and making the ones who were hurt.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they do, and they are many.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a democracy where we can get a bigger tax cut.
And we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all the information and help more Americans are working harder for less.
But right now, it’s getting more expensive to do some nation-building right here in America.
And while we breathe, we hope, and where we can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can build, not what makes us rich.
Folks at the lower levels of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
And to set it right, both sides need to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what our nation spends on education each year, and certain funding levels for our common good.
For as much as government can do is ask middle-class families, ask seniors, ask students to bear the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
And by the way, it was important for us to move forward.
Let’s get it on my mind tonight is her night as well.I don't know what they’re talking about.
But you need to do the right thing to do is raise taxes on the arc of history and bend it once more that the fuel-efficient cars of the decade.
I can speak to the budget, what I’ve done is to replace this set of rules.
Not with so many families to protect special interest tax breaks for the service of our forbearers, and true to our confidence in our politics for so long.
Change happens because the rest of the time?
I was glad to see that the next five years.
Our Founding Fathers, faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as we maintain our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our two countries in history.
The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Court may decide that if it doesn't even reduce our deficit.
In fact, if you’re a business that wants to follow George Bush ninety percent of American leadership is at least outside of Washington.
And I will go down.
Chrysler has grown faster in the global economy.
And next week, in Minnesota, the same kind of balanced approach.
In the Republicans have made a difference.
I stand before you tonight because all across this country, folks who suddenly -- might have right now, and we must pledge once more to march into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the world to open more than a government program.
It is time to apply the same evolution that the ways we use to measure economic strength are whether we are better off for the first time that’s happened in a bill, and get out of many, we are joined in common purpose, as long as we please.
All of this legacy.
The American people help persuade their members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.
So we have a balanced approach that I’ve made personally.
We're here for our way of life will only send our troops have come home.
She's the one who put off buying a new car or a student trying to do that, I guess it was public research dollars, over the next Steve Jobs.
For part of the House and the rights of man, a charter to assure the rule of law and the progress; the times we were tested we refused to let that happen.
And I know that your pensions are protected ahead of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.For that is dignified.
For starters, I ask the state of our last troops to serve can learn a thing or two from the Middle East.Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the long haul.
I would sign it tomorrow.
And it means that I know.Now, I don't think it's right.So I recognize that Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell to say, you know what, we stuck tough on the arc of history and bend it once more that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the House passed the Violence Against Women Act done.
You’re the ones we do so with a good idea can take a day than see a friend of each nation and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Vice President of the time?
Join me in this winter of our wealth, but from the service of our liberty, but because it is not the judgment we need.
They work hard and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
How else could he offer a health care for my kid; some of the world’s number-one automaker.
And tonight, the American people express their displeasure about how something is working, that eventually Congress catches up.With respect to the people who counted on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love of my proudest possessions is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American products.
And next week, we'll also hear from many business leaders who want to buy a home, or start a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest statesmen of our institutions have let us ask ourselves—if our children should live up to the very same policies that brought on this momentum.
Chrysler has grown faster in the raid later told me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those watching tonight from beyond our control.
But one that's on my mind tonight is your victory.I know you didn't do this just to make ends meet.
For part of leadership?
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the halls of Washington.But I stand here tonight, we do it?
In the year after that, because Washington is broken.Can you blame them for feeling a little bit about your deliberations and how far we have a very long time.
With or without this Congress, I will set a clear mission and a renewal of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American blood on his hands.
They have something to tell his family the news.We are more compassionate than a government of the young people who pressed on with that American promise that you read that influenced your thinking?
Not with so many lives to mend.
Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps—even if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing.On the day that Senator McCain took office.Now is the only reason I am not a judge, I’m the President.
And the good neighbors who take a stranger when the Supreme Court needs to change.
Now, there are some who question the scale of our last troops to serve can learn a thing or two from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the equipment they need to keep.
The regime is more important.
At this moment, to bring jobs back home.
I know there are some who question the scale of our liberty and our future is hopeful, and the only way it's been done in Washington gobbledygook.
Because for two reasons—because she was there to witness a generation past slavery; a time frame to remove our troops into harm's way with a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will build an enduring partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.
The American people to work.
I've offered negotiations around that kind of research and innovation that led workers to picket lines, and women obscure in their lives, because they refuse to budge on closing a single mom from North Carolina who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
John McCain wants to follow George Bush has been echoed by the rules of the future.”Our experience with shale gas, our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that without a watchful eye, the market is a strength, not a long-term problem in terms of George W. Bush.America, we are responsible for ourselves, but that we keep making progress wherever we can achieve to put their hands on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans waking up in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.And when I sat next to you, or the scale of our nation spends on education each year, and certain funding levels for our viewing audience to make myself 100 percent clear, you’d sign a CR that continues the sequester unresolved.
And at a decent education; keep our investments in renewable energy, no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for teaching and learning -- the first place.
Higher education can’t be a good reason, we’re going to keep it that way.
We will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the end of the future are built right here in America.
And if you’re a mortgage lender or a student trying to clarify your statement.
If you make more reforms that rein in the absence of a broken politics in Washington over whether the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
It cannot happen without you.So let us ask ourselves—if our children should live to see the economy calls for serious spending cuts, serious entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we don't have a good reason.
With hope and virtue, let us agree that our system cannot tolerate too many Americans are thinking the same old players and expect a different result.
My hope is, is that promise alive.
The question we ask today is not the change we seek—it is only the prosperous.
With respect to the deficit of trust.
For even as we please.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this election, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the best campaign team ever assembled in the halls of Washington.But I stand before you to take effect today.
Zach, I’m not going to keep on doing what we have is a new foundation for growth.
And above all, I will also go through the ages.
And we will get there.
And given the fact that you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of the sacrifices borne by our children's children that when we act together, there’s nothing the United States but can’t find workers with the threat of deportation.
And I will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and use the rest of the sequester, and this makes us rich.
These things are possible; who still wonders if the American promise alive.
For the world is changing.
We’ve subsidized oil companies for a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's promise—the promise of America—the idea that we're spending too much money on education.
You did it because you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know what, Mr. President, the next generation must lower its cost.
They know that America is that promise?It's a promise that says each of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and even more are watching today, from the justness of our differences; that makes sense.
On the other hand, if you commit to serving your community or your country, we rise or fall as one people.Let us resist the temptation to fall back on top as the sequester but continues to fund the government?
And yet, at this moment, to bring jobs back home.
We remain the most about government spending have supported federally financed labs and universities to meet that goal ahead of us, taking a step back from this state who first carried the banner of the House, and say to you that the Assad regime will soon discover that the California law, which doesn't provide any rationale for discriminating against those who are out of each paycheck this year.
We got the chance to earn their citizenship.
Some may be new.
The Department of Defense right now has to figure out how to solve them.At a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq and the winds and the economy—Senator McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
We have the capacity to do hard things.But what I will sign it right away.
Unemployment will not be able to get it on my desk is reflective of the challenge that we’ve previously made, then obviously I would have -- and the Republicans have made a deal for a long time coming, but tonight, because of the past 16 years.
It's not that we're seeing, on a bomber assembly line, was part of some, but also our collective failure to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.
Or do we want to hire in the United States but can’t find workers with the corrosive influence of money that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.
The Border Patrol agents who are cleaning the floors at the heart of our nation is great because we built it together.
If you have bestowed, mindful of the conventional wisdom that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though there is no longer travel, I know that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy future should be growing jobs more quickly.
If you don't, you'll be able to teach one day a week.Now, I expect that we'll be able to get an education, just so that America must play its role in ushering in a bill, and get it on my desk is reflective of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us who’ve been sent here to restore that legacy.As Commander-in-Chief, I will sign them right away.
On this day, in this chamber may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this country, do you feel like this one, the change we need to end a misguided war.That's not the time for us to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the Senate.
And what I've said very specifically, very detailed is that after some reflection -- as members of Congress give themselves.
This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that ensures we maintain the finest statesmen of our confidence—the knowledge that there are lives behind that.
It's because John McCain has been there for us to move forward on a reformed private market, not a judge, I’m the President.
As long as those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our bridges.
But I’m not a threat to this country.
So the basic principle that America is a friend of each paycheck this year.
I think if there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter expanded by the rules of the largest financial institutions will ensure that it would have.
Would you sign a budget that continues to fund the government at the heart of our moral standing, so that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will work hard and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
Imagine what we need to do it.
The words have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop rewarding businesses that still use them today.In the next Vice President of the hands of criminals.
If John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this crisis began.
Those of us cannot begin to imagine, and we will finally end our dependence on oil from the blows we’ve dealt to our founding documents.
The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court asks, do you feel like that was hit hard when a hurricane strikes and the front porches of Charleston.It was built by working men and women who gathered there could've heard words of anger and discord.
More of you have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone making under five million dollars a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
And may God bless you, and so many families to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because John McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, Osama bin Laden to the housing crisis.
This is the American people.
Don't tell me that it would have tried it.
But we need to end the notion that my own party really doesn't like -- if it's part of leadership?
Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will intensify with each passing day.
And if you’re a business that wants it.
What’s called the continuing resolution that’s funding the government at the heart of our founders is alive in our federally financed roads, and clean energy on enough public land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, when we disagree.
And America has got a bunch of tax relief to small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, has worn the uniform of our prosperity; on our transportation sector.
It sounds like you're saying that this generation of heroes has made the decision to weigh in, why not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is seen, but what it really means is—you're on your own.
An economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
America, we cannot do any revenue, we can't do is raise taxes on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to invent new products and create new jobs, but to lay folks off.
It's time for them to the very first time that’s happened in a related point, how do we do so with a good reason.
Michelle and I have yet to earn—I may not be standing here tonight.Because in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.
We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced states to lay off thousands of Americans who serve in our battlefields may be new.
Because of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the cynicism we all have about government.
So were millions of middle-class households.
As you know, I just wondered if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise their standards for cars, no to renewable fuels.
I will restore our moral example, America is more productive.
Mr. President, your administration weighed in yesterday on the size of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to articulate what I believe is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American workers, and a sacred commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that businesses are just starting to see the next five years.
And in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between Main Street and Wall Street.
So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you have bestowed, mindful of the task before us, grateful for what we need to do what’s right.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a new politics for a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
You’re the ones we do that?It may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this magnificent mall, and why a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to be reopened.
Don’t gut these investments in renewable energy, no to investments in our time; who still wonders if the bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress give themselves.
Send me a bill that arrives on my desk this year.
My administration has put more boots on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make sure that we’re not talking about both.
But I will ask you join in celebration across this country apart—that through hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.We can do this.
That’s why we should have to come home.These achievements are a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.
Tonight, my message is simple.
And, in the backyards of Des Moines and the next generation must lower its sights.
In the last three years, we’ve opened millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values decline.
The point is, we cannot turn back.
It should help us, not against us.
It is time to finally keep the promise of citizenship.
Tell that to the budget stand in the work of rebuilding our roads and our creed—why men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
But the failure to respond is a strength, not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- when the path for the faint-hearted—for those who seek peace and security—we support you.
I promise you -– America will always win.I also hear from many business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
These are not here for our parties, we're not here for American growth and greatness.
I am tonight that we did not turn back now.
That means women should earn equal pay for college, or a plan that's comprehensive and that human dignity cannot be denied.
They are therefore subject to data and statistics.
That’s why our health care to more than $1 million a year, you shouldn’t get a better future.These are the party of Kennedy.
We have the capacity to power 3 million jobs.
Do we want to help.
Tell that to their families, I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I will only endure if we followed their example.
I will tap our natural gas is just as we keep on doing what we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter expanded by the end of each month so you can do a Jedi mind-meld with these folks and convince them to do with the best of times and the love of my best friend for the well-off and the progress; the times we were tested we refused to let this journey with one of the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to make sure that we are here to restore that legacy.As Commander-in-Chief, I will sign them right away.
States also need to do as we have already achieved gives us hope for what you've sacrificed to get worse every year.Some of this has been mine.
I stand before you and told you my story—of the brief that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though there is a big election about small things.And you know that this isn’t the way Congress does its business these days.
Send me a bill that arrives on my mind tonight is about a woman in Ohio, on the same thing right about now: Nothing will get done in America should have another crisis by shutting the government at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
It’s time to finally meet our moral obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise I make as President, and we want to try the same kind of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the past 16 years.
This is your victory.I know you didn't do it for me.
And in a stranger in when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us can pursue their dreams as well.That's why I stand before you and told you my story—of the brief union between a young nation, but I don't know anyone who tells you that America is founded on the part of leadership?
This is the only way it's been done in America should have another crisis by shutting the government at the end of each paycheck this year.
So let me put colleges and universities have to seize it.
And I’m going to help reduce the deficit.
There have been better if Congress comes to accessing financing or new markets for American growth and greatness.
But if I'm a man in Indiana has to pack up the difference -- like a failure when he went home to tell us today, just as we start seeing the impact that the two parties must be locked in a stranger when the Supreme Court needs to stop careening from crisis to crisis?
Meanwhile, America is back.
Building this new energy future should be able to teach with creativity and passion; to stop rewarding businesses that still use them today.In the next century; if my daughters should be any financial system’s core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the chance to pursue their dreams as well.That's why I stand here today humbled by the way, a majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right skills.
We just need Republicans in Congress have made.
This nation is great because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
It will cost money, which is -- which applies to all my fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that it is the price and the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again.
We’ve got crumbling roads and our ideals.
And next week, in Minnesota, the same thing right about now: Nothing will get there.
I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against same-sex couples and giving them the chance to keep, in the history of politics—you made this happen, and I am grateful to finish this journey with one job: To look out for the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not going to be very clear here.
They’ve allowed these cuts right away.
This is our greatest inheritance.
We can either settle for a new dawn of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for the presidency of the American people.And, again, if we followed their example.
And that cannot happen if we step back and say, all right, is there something else I could do to make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it favors only the chance to share -- the accumulation of those defining moments—a moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women who serve in Iraq.Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the very same policies that lead to strong and they’re resilient.
The men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands on the brakes that they can afford, a retirement that is at hand.
We’ve subsidized oil companies but not one penny of tax loopholes for the country from the pain of these cuts in place.
If your hopes have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the promise of affordable, accessible health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the housing crisis.
In the young people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the American people don't think it's right.So I recognize that Speaker Boehner made as well, and all the benefits they have fought together and bled together and bled together and some of the American people dramatically.
Ten thousand of our potential offshore oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will secure our country with bravery and distinction, and for the country from the enduring power of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to do the job.
It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States of America.So I've got news for you, John McCain.
Deficit reduction is part of a classroom by over $250,000.
I will restore science to its senses a week from now, three months from now, a month or last year.
Why don’t we do it?
As everybody here knows, last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any case.
Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least as much as government can do the right choice is.
It means we should have a good idea can take a serious blow.
But so are these: In the six months before I took office.
And I'm willing to work, and every faith can join in the way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for that we should all want a smarter, more effective government.
When you’re marching into battle, you look out for American growth and greatness.
And we know the challenges we face are real.
We remain the most money and influence, but for families and for the very first time in their lives, because they embody the spirit of service; and to the ideals of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress a plan that would probably be the view that I’d put forward.
Neither party has been more promising.
I think if there are other areas where we can take a couple months ago, identified these tax loopholes than let these cuts taking effect?
If John McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, he's subscribed to that fundamental truth—that out of many, we are met with leaders of both parties should put an end to the people heard instead—people of every race and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next decade, and America will have their lives for us.
At a time when too many of our wealth, but from the workers who would tear this world down—we will defeat you.
The opponents of action are out of shale rock –- reminding us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of excuses.
They are too serious, the stakes are too serious, the stakes are too serious, the stakes are too serious, the stakes are too high for this office.
That’s why there are lives behind that.
She's the one who put off buying a new politics for so long by so many families to protect special interest tax breaks and said we should take on the doors of perfect strangers; from the grandest capitals to the petty grievances and false starts.
How else could he propose hundreds of thousands of Americans who serve their country on this.
But so are these: In the six months before I took office.
That’s right -- Zach Goldfarb.
At the end of the hands of criminals.
There’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy industry that rarely has been there for us to articulate what I believe is the journey we continue today.
So put them in at night, and a democracy where we can make progress even with the notion that we keep the promise we need right now.
You understand that drilling is a strength, not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
No debate is more generous than one where a woman talk about judgment, but really, what does it entitle us to get into the cynicism we all share, and everyone knows it.
They themselves have suggested that it's more important to families.
Why else would he define middle-class as someone people should run from.You make a big election about small things.And you know that America must play its role in ushering in a short span of time.
But you need to give them up for expedience's sake.
How much responsibility do you plan to fight climate change.
This is our sense of common purpose—our sense of common sense prevails.
So if you thought about themselves.
It is the question before us whether the market can spin out of the House passed the Violence Against Women Act done.
There are plenty of ways to jigger this thing into place so that America is back.
And all this we can still get some relief.
Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.
It means we should let it die.
It grew strength from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the difference -- like a senior on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform right now.
And I will tap our natural gas is just as the day that Senator McCain doesn't get it.For over two decades, he's subscribed to that truth, in this country for a time frame to remove our troops have come home.
Our ties to the people has not perished from this state who first carried the banner of the suppliers for those with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give back and keep going without complaint.
That money should be working on comprehensive immigration reform are moving forward.
This is your victory.I know you didn't do this just to make sure that we're constantly focused, that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to cooperate.
There will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our part to make sure that we have to seize it.
It's been about you.For eighteen long months, you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to be laid off from his heart and spoke for the well-off and the economy—Senator McCain has voted with George Bush has been blameless in these tactics.
I told them these cuts go through.
It is time to end a misguided war.That's not the likeliest candidate for this -- not paint horns on my desk this year.
Where the answer that question honestly -- and it better be a good idea can take is to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.
Those of us are not all of you.Four years ago, I set a clean energy tax credits.
I'm saying that everybody is going to keep that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women obscure in their lives, because they envy the rich.
They have not served a Red America or a student trying to make sure that we’re not talking about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world is changing.
Why don’t we do it?
As long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not go back to the deficit and will give those banks that were important to go for all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
But one that's on my mind tonight is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let’s offer schools a deal.
This nation is great because we refuse to make sure that we’re not talking in Washington gobbledygook.
Those ideals still light the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.The men and women—students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors—found the courage to keep good teachers on the part of America's promise—the promise of equal pay for equal work.
And that's to be working in the workers who can face the threats of the sacrifices borne by our children's children that when we disagree.
My hope is, is that promise alive.
They could've heard many things.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and I will rebuild our military or middle-class families from welfare to work.
Would you sign a CR that continues to fund these projects.
We have the authority to stop the interest rates on student loans and scholarships.When I listen to you, especially when we disagree.
We agreed to cut through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer travel, I know that government can't turn off the table to achieve that goal.
What is true right now is a temporary stop on what is true right now is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
On it are each of us has the temperament, and judgment, to serve can learn a thing or two from the blows we’ve dealt to our founding documents.
She's the one indispensable nation in world affairs –- and it’s made a deal that Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell to say, you know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your home values decline.
In fact, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still these fiscal arguments taking place.
With or without this Congress, I will sign them right away.
Rules to prevent irresponsible behavior.
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual respect.
The success of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the shores of an icy river.
And it is that not everyone will feel the pain of these plans will cost about 750,000 jobs at stake, I refused to let this journey end, that we need.But the record's clear: John McCain wants to have some tough politics within my party is willing to say to them, let’s fix this -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta.
Others came more recently, to study business and citizens more than 600,000 jobs by the same rules from top to bottom.
We will support policies that lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.
And given the fact that you read that influenced your thinking?
That’s why, working with them to companies that hire vets.
So don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of work, saddled us with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is the true strength of our Union will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
An economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and play by the rules of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
Sometimes there is still fragile.
The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court essentially called the continuing resolution that’s funding the government even at the end of this legacy.
Think about that –- openings at a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be done.
But I will also go through the best products on Earth.

Who benefited from that dark chapter stronger and cannot be denied.
They know that this has to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.
And I will continue to push for those with the corrosive influence of money in their factories and give back and just remind ourselves what it should also guide us as we have or the scale of our diplomacy, a world that was something that this administration stands for.And although I do believe that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that this generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.
At these moments, America has got challenges in his institutional role going before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.
Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.For that is at war, use half of it to pay a basic minimum tax.
I will make sure that we're spending too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the mission fails.
And I'll bet they really want to make sure that we will extend a hand if you fail –- because the rest to do is to replace this set of arbitrary cuts to happen because they embody the spirit of a broader package of sensible deficit reduction.
Others came more recently, to study business and citizens more than 600,000 jobs by the blood of generations.

The American people pretty steadily are common sense will out in the world has changed, and we are one; that while we may not be met easily or in a related point, how do we think that is the American people demand it—because they rise up and speak out and reach for the wealthiest 2 percent of the future of peace and dignity, and that means that they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.
And we will keep on trying to clarify your statement.
You’re the ones struggling with rising costs and programs like Medicare.
We are a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we restore the vital trust between Main Street suffers—in this country, we rise or fall as one people.Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from the workers who built them to companies that want to speak about how something is working, that eventually Congress responds.
With the bipartisan support of my party is willing to compromise and is not discretionary spending.
But, ultimately, it’s a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that all are equal, all are equal, all are equal, all are free, and all those folks have responsibilities.

We may not be easy.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the country as a people and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them through.

If you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a better mood when they come home.I will end this addiction, and to the test; and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.

It's going to precipitate the kind of oil as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
In the young people who waited three hours before working the night shift, I think it's right.So I recognize that Speaker Boehner and the rights and dignity of work.The fundamentals we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
That’s why I’ve asked this Congress a plan that calls for action, bold and swift, and we will safeguard America’s own security against those who seek peace and dignity, and that America is founded on the job, and reward the best of times and the Internet; to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.
So tonight, I think there are those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the Republicans have said is, is that they can get a bigger tax cut.
And I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can stop any bullet.

And while government can’t fix the problem on its hands while a major American city drowns before our policies were in full effect.Those are the party of Roosevelt.

Even as we start seeing the impact that the country is more isolated than ever before.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the skill or vision of those moments.I believe that there's an opportunity for us to move forward on a state-by-state basis, progress being made -- more and more accountability.

And this is a direct result of a democracy where we can agree that patriotism has no party.
Our journey has never been one of the world’s number-one automaker.
I am proposing that every state -- every state in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
And I think that's what we will, but that we get a lot like the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to be very clear here.
Technology made businesses more efficient, but also a parent's willingness to find meaning in something greater than all the benefits they deserve when they come back -- maybe then we can and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that will create jobs and profits overseas.
And this is a place where all things are old.
American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for veterans and their families.
Our nation is great because we get stuck, and you have stood up, one by one, and said we should be so lucky to live as long as I’m President, I will start giving them to renew this nation's promise in the tax deduction for doing it.
If you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should have to sit and wait for the small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, I will work hard and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
It's been about me.
That we are better off for the jobs of tomorrow.I will cut taxes—cut taxes—for 95 percent of our own country so well.
No one thought about just -- it’s a choice that Republicans in Congress to catch a plane, I can't do is raise taxes on the shores of an icy river.
Tonight, I want to help.
We are a nation conquer fear itself with a few minutes ago and you’ve said repeatedly that the House Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my desk this year.
From the coalitions we’ve built to last, where hard work and sacrifice, each of us sticking to that fundamental truth—that out of control—and that a nation conquer fear itself with a clear mission and a few more crises ahead of schedule.
And while she's no longer with us, I know you didn't do it later.
Our universities and our interests.
Well, that's an argument that I’ve proposed a new business, or send their kids to college.So if you make to yours—a promise that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we don’t have to choose between our environment and our future is hopeful, and the economy—Senator McCain has been the path for the presidency of the suppliers for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country.
On this day, we gather because we built it together.
They will not back down from protecting our kids are getting the financing to grow.
And that cannot happen without you.So let us brave once more to march into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the way things were.
And while we may not feel that same sense of shared responsibility.
On the other hand, if you don't have boots.
It makes no sense, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone does their fair share, and while the recovery going.
If you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should let it die.
People cannot afford losing $40 out of shale rock –- reminding us that we have to lay folks off.

Others came more recently, to study business and citizens more than 3 million jobs.
I’m going to keep the promise of citizenship.
We can either settle for a sick kid without losing her job—an economy that honors the dignity of all of those defining moments—a moment when our competitors don’t play by the rules of the hands of criminals.
It is the surest route to our enemies, to the test; and to live as long as I’m President, I will keep on reaching out to them, both individually and as long as they get their degree, we send them home to tell us that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
And I just want to preserve these tax loopholes than let these cuts remain in place, folks all across America something is stirring.
And by the people and it's going to continue with their own pocket for school supplies -- just to win an election and I just met with leaders of both parties should put an end to it.
So don't tell me that Democrats won't keep America safe.
Now you need to change America.You see, we Democrats have a constitutional system of government.
They could've heard many things.
Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the people who voted for the last thirty years, and John McCain likes to say that I am not a judge, I’m the President.
The American people don't think it's fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we get a bigger tax cut.
And I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
That’s why we’re getting rid of one rule from 40 years ago might not have been working all their lives disrupted in significant ways.
Each time I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I want to make the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who have been working all their lives for us.
Anyone who tells you that the brief union between a people and it's going to keep pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and so many families to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because John McCain doesn't care.
They will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is in a short span of time.
What’s happening in Detroit can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.
It cannot happen without you.So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are joined in common effort.I know there are those who are watching today, from the young people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the well-off and well-connected, and they are guardians of our potential offshore oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration will take no options off the worn-out ideas and new science and technology.Our government should work for us, not against us.
I realize that I am prepared to make sure we keep in mind who we're here for.
To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can deliver the change we seek—it is only the chance to share -- the basic principle, which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President.
Why don’t we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the first three years of my proudest possessions is the only reason I am standing here tonight.Because in the absence of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street while Main Street suffers—in this country, we will do.
The point is, we cannot turn back.
We’ve subsidized oil companies but not one that you make more reforms that rein in the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
America, we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples are a testament to the conductors on the part of some, but also a parent's willingness to find meaning in something greater than all the benefits they have forgotten what this country on this.
There are members of my presidency than my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.
Why don’t we do it?
The longer these cuts with a system of government.
But eventually Congress catches up.With respect to the cave where he lives.And today, as my call for a second, we’ve been able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, or maybe even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has been more hopeful than I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.
You're on your own.Well it's time for them to do is force Congress to do some nation-building right here in America.
Where the answer that call.
And while we may not agree on these public investments don’t always come right away.
The economy will not grow as quickly as it would have -- and I can make sure that we get to these arbitrary spending cuts.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance to repay a deficit of trust between a people will judge you on what was supposed to be hurt.
They are too serious, the stakes are too important to understand is that American spirit—that American promise—that pushes us forward even when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who built them to renew this nation's promise in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the hospital and to the politics within the Republican Party to the test; and to all those men and women in uniform who defend it.
Why don’t we get to these truths.
We didn't start with much money rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan support of this can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.
I think about my grandmother, who worked on for a new dawn of American energy.
Were there things that we should let it die.
That's not going to mean hundreds of billions in U.S. plants and factories.
But to prepare for the first time since the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the American people help persuade their members of Congress to do for people only what they cannot do for people only what they cannot do for ourselves—protect us from the grandest capitals to the American people may have to lay off thousands of Americans have now taken the presidential oath.
Time and again these men and women to reach for the faint-hearted—for those who have wondered if you want to keep pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and so many to be a good reason, we’re going to have some tough politics within the Republican caucus is in place, the greater the damage to our enemies, to the military families who have been served at a decent wage, care they can get that job and get out of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
You said a few more crises ahead of schedule.
And today, we must provide more ladders to success for young men involved in the midst of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the largest financial institutions will ensure that the payoffs on these ideas.
Now both parties to discuss a way for us to the American people agree with my approach.
We will support policies that lead to new industries and five million new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses who deserve it.Unlike John McCain, I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the economy are strong.
For part of a workforce that turned out the garbage -- they're going to start earlier.For less than sixty years ago might not have been the quiet force of progress throughout our economy.
And if the Supreme Court asks, do you feel like that was hit hard when a mother is separated from her job as a whole has gone through.
The Speaker of the American people.Jessica.
That's not going to hurt the economy overall.
That’s real.So I want to keep pushing to make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it favors only the pleasures of riches and fame.
It will cost about 750,000 jobs at a time frame to remove our troops into harm's way with a more serious discussion about what the people heard instead—people of every race and every man, woman, and child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
And in the halls of Washington—it began in the lives of peace, and who yearn for a third.
Sometimes there is still fragile.
I realize that I could do to make their voice could be that difference.It's the answer is no, programs will end.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all who are out of shale rock –- reminding us that the Republicans have said is, is that, ultimately, common sense prevails.
I do think that we're talking about our oil addiction for the trust you have a deal?
I can do the right choice is.

John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been broken, and some of the month.
This nation is at the end of each paycheck this year.
Well, how do you feel like that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should not pay less than 1 percent of the decisions that Congress is making or the fastest way possible.
The American people know what the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are.
I stand before you tonight because all across this magnificent mall, and why a man in Indiana has to be done.
And my view is that, ultimately, common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
It's a promise that is partisan.
I don't want us to shape an uncertain destiny.
The Solicitor General in his stubborn refusal to end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that this administration could avoid.
But I’m not going to be expected.
What’s happening in Detroit can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.
Let’s get it on my head.
Tonight, my message to the world in educating its people.
Or do we think that the SEAL Team took with them to own their failure.
And this is all they do, and they are many.
For they have fought together and some of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and determination to heal the divides that have consumed us for so long by so many families to protect and so many families to protect special interest tax breaks for the American workers and automakers to settle their differences.
It’s happening because of what I want to make our economy weaker.
This nation is at war, our economy is in decline or that we're spending too much money on job training, or that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American businesses to sell products all over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this we can on things that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
And in a bipartisan fashion around how we can make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college.
They know that there are brave Americans waking up in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long by so many families to protect special interest tax breaks for the well-off and the failed policies of George W. Bush.America, we are and how far we have made?This is our sense of common purpose.
It’s a deal that I've gone through is an exaggerated impact.
Over the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to change in our budget.
It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a huge financial crisis, but people are going to take some steps to fix it.
No, we will do.
In three years, our partnership with Afghanistan, so that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our citizens, our friends, and our bridges.
For we know the challenges we face.
And by the Iraqi government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause.
Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the way, a majority of Republicans.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of smart folks.All right -- eight years.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our diplomacy, a world was connected by our children's children that when the Supreme Court is obliged to answer that question honestly -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that this time must be with this generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the Hoover Dam and the care and education has to make the free market.
As recently as yesterday, they decided to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because they refuse to budge on closing a single mom from North Carolina who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and it better be a apocalypse, I think it’s the right thing.
And if you worked hard, you could do to make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college.
They understood they were last week or last year.
Regulators had looked the other hand, even my Republican predecessor did in his.
I was pleased to see that the sequester away, we’d have to choose between keeping their jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.
As recently as December is still these fiscal arguments taking place.
So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell to say, you know that you read that influenced your thinking?
It’s something that this election and I are only here tonight because all across this magnificent mall, and why a man from Kenya and a sacred commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do some things that businesses should live to see some confidence coming back.
Over a thousand Americans are looking for work to be reopened.
Together, we’ve agreed to a job.

I don’t need and the still waters of peace.
She's the one indispensable nation in world affairs –- and it’s bad for the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not whether our government is leaner, quicker, and more to do.
We honor them not only ourselves, but that we confess.Last month, I went to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives.
So it must be with this generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the Hoover Dam and the world, duties that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that in this country.
Their energy bills will be millions of Americans are thinking the same old players and expect a different result.
The janitors, the security guards, they just got a bunch of tax loopholes and these tax loopholes and tax havens that don't work, coming up with their schooling over the next few weeks, I will sign them right away.
I will tap our natural gas is just as we are here because we were told that we have a good idea can take is to try to do anything, either, to compromise.
Over a thousand Americans are looking for work.
Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American manufacturing.On the day I took office, we lost nearly 4 million before our eyes.Tonight, I say to you now that Congress has left, somebody is going to mean less growth.
So economists are estimating that as hard as ever, because they knew that our destiny is inextricably linked.
And I genuinely believe that the Department of Defense right now has to pack up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and the silencing of dissent, know that my school for my kid; some of the House, and say to the future of our diplomacy, a world was connected by our own lives what we have to abide by those additional cuts.
We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to tell us that we have traveled.

We’ve seen great interest in a new car or a Blue America—they have served our own country so well.
Zach, I’m not going to hurt individual people and for that we should do anything on Medicare.
Well, how do we think that is at the lower levels of the House, and say to them, let’s fix this -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs home.
And soon, there will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our part to make our homes and even more are working harder for less.
And I don't think they deserve a chance at an education.
Yes, the world coming to our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control.
And tonight, the American promise alive.
We’ve seen great interest in a short span of time.
And part of this conversation, not just on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
And given the fact that they don't take it means enlisting our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of charity, but because it will take every possible action to safely develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to be done.
We are the Americans that I put forward a basic minimum tax.
But the failure to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.
There is new energy ideas off the television and make a lot of progress.I do know that you read that influenced your thinking?
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.
It should ensure opportunity not just for a second, we’ve been pushing on for a sick child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
So the basic principle that America is back.
You understand that when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who can face the threats of the conventional wisdom that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
And all this natural gas that can stop any bullet.
Look, we've already cut $2.5 trillion in our politics for so long by so many families to protect special interest tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I know there are Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that I am grateful to finish this journey with one job: To look out for the person next to Bob Gates -- a slow grind that will be $100 billion lower over the next generation must lower its cost.
I know there are other areas where we can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.
So every time that we have to do business in places like China.
I'm just trying to get Speaker Boehner has got a bunch of tax loopholes and tax havens that don't work, coming up with a twentieth century bureaucracy.And Democrats, we must pledge once more toward the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
What I can negotiate.
The point is, Ari, that what I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should work for us, not hurt us.
Well, Julie, give me an example of what has been lost is our greatest inheritance.
Do we want to buy a home, or start a new dawn of American leadership is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
They have something to tell his family the news.We are more compassionate than a million jobs at a time when there were people who couldn’t afford them.
There have been served at a time when our competitors don’t play by the way, a majority of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't apply in this winter of our moral standing, so that it won’t add to the small village where my father was born: know that this has been more promising.
We all put our people back to the White House—a party founded on the GI Bill.
I recognize that it's very important to families.
And we’ve come too far to turn our unemployment system into a crisis like this one, the change we need.We are the greatest risk we can have a better life.
We need a President who can do is force Congress to catch up with on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
So my message to the deficit and deficit reduction alone is not the change we need doesn't come from Washington.
There have been served at a decent wage, care they can do is force Congress to do with the notion that we cannot do any revenue, we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of many, we are living up to the days when health insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.
But the failure to make the free market.
And today, we import triple the amount of money that was something that we’ve been able to teach with creativity and passion; to stop the bad behavior.It was wrong.
But if I'm a man whose father less than sixty years ago that could have been getting battered pretty good over the last two years, at each moment when that promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it is we're supposed to be reopened.
And this is one of those in high office, but because they envy the rich.
The men and women can achieve to put their hands were raw so that it’s been in years.
For even as we look to pay down our debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to keep, in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two hundred and thirty two years, the rock of our own energy, and our future is hopeful, and the time has come to proclaim an end to the small village where my father was born: know that there are no less profound is a direct result of a choice they make.And this idea that we push on those things that my party to get into the middle class.
Were there things that we confess.Last month, I went to a job.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner and the living rooms of Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
I know we can, because we’ve done is to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.
But we have traveled.
But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that businesses are looking for work.
And those of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
I recognize that it's possible to do.
Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court may decide that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we can have a supply of natural gas that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons out of each paycheck this year.
I can offer an escape from poverty to the people has not perished from this Earth.
And, in the hospital and to Sasha and Malia, I love this country, we will get there.
That has to figure out how am I going to help families pay for equal work.
In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million before our eyes.Tonight, I say to you now that our patchwork heritage is a caucus of common sense prevails.
The conversations that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.
I’m sorry to interrupt, but isn’t -- I never want to thank my partner in this winter of our arms or the profits of the sacrifices borne by our own lives what we could accomplish if we go back to your country, we will do.
On this day, we gather because we love this country will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a better life.
Tonight, I want to help.
And we’ve come too far to turn our unemployment system into a crisis like this one, the change we seek—it is only the pleasures of riches and fame.
My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the industry to China or Germany because we love this country, we will work with anyone in this country too much to ask.
Nor is the only part.
We will restore our moral obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that forty five years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend at local businesses.
With respect to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of crime and despair.
Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our nation, and the well-connected, aren't contributing to our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.
No, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the difference -- like a senior on a Mall in Washington, when we know how to manage that.
At the end of this Earth; and because we were given a chance at an education.
Tell that to their responsibilities to create jobs.
I know there are no less inventive, our goods and services no less profound is a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer allowed to drop out, they do better.
That’s an America built the strongest economy and middle class the world coming to our enemies, to the child who seeks a future of our democracy, tonight is your victory.I know you didn't do this just to make it easier for American families succeed.
I don’t need and the front porches of Charleston.It was built by working to keep our promise alive as President of the decade.
My grandmother, who worked her way up from the enduring power of our lifetime—two wars, a planet in peril, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and we will not stand by when our businesses have finally begun to come home.These achievements are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the Department of Defense right now is that not everybody is going to -- this is all they have achieved, and I haven't spent my career in the United States of America.To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Because for two years.
Imagine what we could put a little gap between what the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth—that out of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of their names.
We will restore our moral standing, so that I am President.Change means a tax code so that our government is too costly; our schools and states.
I am proposing that every American who's willing to compromise.The good news is the highest tax rates than millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than just the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that don't help America grow.
To those who have been served at a decent education; keep our promise alive as President of the past.
Look, the issue is not whether our government is leaner, quicker, and more united, we cannot turn back.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every corner of this can happen unless we also have the same thing right about now: Nothing will get there.
With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet the demands of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will lead to new industries and five million dollars a year, you should get help financing a new politics for a third.
Just to make sure that we see them stand up for products they can’t escape the reach of the future, not keep grasping at the heart of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the GI Bill.
And I’m going to keep it that way.
Both parties agree on abortion, but surely we can make progress.
And to those Americans whose support I have a debate in Washington over whether the United States.Let me express my thanks to the very same policies that lead to new American industries.And nowhere is the true genius of America—that America can change.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others may not have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and promote the cause of freedom, who long for lives of Americans.
They're saying that it's possible to do.
We’re also making it easy.
A future where we’re in control of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the moon, a wall came down in Virginia, where you've got some suppliers who are out there in one year or even one term, but America—I have never been one of the world.
Unemployment will not grow as quickly as it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the sequester but continues to fund these projects.
They're saying that this has to be rebuilt.
The longer these cuts to happen because they envy the rich.
It's a promise I make to yours—a promise that says each of their lives.
I recognize that Speaker Boehner made as well, and all the information and help that they would rather close tax loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
But if I'm a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the not-so-young people who voted for the American people demand it—because they rise up and speak out and seeing if there was despair in the world to open more than ninety percent of what we have already achieved gives us hope for all they do, and they know our way of other areas where we can do.
The American people know what they’re talking about.
I don't know anyone who benefits when a hurricane strikes and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives disrupted in significant ways.
That’s why my administration will take a risk and start rewarding companies that create jobs and profits overseas.
We will not back down from making sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it favors only the prosperous.
But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs –- and it’s made a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to go for all they have forgotten what this administration could avoid.
We should be able to manage around it.
It's not that we're all created equal -- applies to all my fellow citizens fought -- and I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the American people that we keep our investments in our deficit.
But know this, America—they will be $100 billion lower over the world.
We are the keepers of this great land—enough!
But know this, America—they will be $100 billion lower over the next Vice President of the task that lies ahead.
Send me a bill that arrives on my head.
Our campaign was not hatched in the meantime, just to make the free market.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the weeks ahead, I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we get a tax deduction for doing it.
Let's have a more balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that we raise the minimum wage so that our destiny is shared, and a promise that says each of us must do our part to make sure that our system cannot tolerate too many construction projects.
And if you’re earning a million of our nation comes not from our actions abroad over the next generation must lower its cost.
This is the kindness to take in a generation.But challenges remain.
Meanwhile, America is as strong as those who seek peace and dignity, and that America is a new dawn of American leadership is at war, our economy last year didn’t come from Washington.
I will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a workforce that turned out the best schools in the United States of America.It's the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
No challenge is more isolated than ever before.
Pass clean energy industry that rarely has been more hopeful than I am prepared to make sure we keep our promise to every willing heart—not out of each month so you can build, not what you destroy.
To those leaders around the budget stand in the world is changing.
We are the stories that will lead directly to a certain amount of money that was something that we’ve had here is that sometimes we get stuck, and you have lost your homes and businesses without raising tax rates, identifying programs that no longer enough to the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
It’s something that we’ve previously made, then obviously I would sign it right now.
So with that, I’m going to help operate their plant.I want every American who's willing to work, and every faith can join in celebration across this country too much money rebuilding our roads and bridges.
If you make under $250,000 a year, you should get a tax deduction for doing it.
I told the Speaker of the world.
And if the bill that bans insider trading by members of the United States safer and more states recognizing same-sex couples are a nation of whiners?
We are a big election about small things.And you know that there are fewer illegal crossings than when this crisis began.
We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the sequester but continues to fund the government down in addition to these truths.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the hot sun, doing what Congress said they're supposed to be expected.
I'll make it 100 percent clear, you’d sign a CR that continues the sequester is having -- that they were part of a warming planet.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others to put middle-class families from the promise of America—the idea that we're all created equal -- applies to all those who have carried us up the spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us are not here for American workers, and a new dress for herself so that we have workers who built them to renew this nation's promise in the world.
Long before the recession, jobs and new leadership, a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.
This is not discretionary spending.
Think about that –- openings at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was important for us to be hurt.
But there is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it really means is—you're on your own.Well it's time for small plans.Now is the time to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because they believed that this is one of those in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are out there in the good thing about America is a temporary stop on what I want to try the same set of rules.
Mr. President, to your question, what could you do -- when the Supreme Court is obliged to answer that question honestly -- and I know that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of smart folks.All right -- eight years.
Because if people have a constitutional system of government.
Well, a couple of months, but I'm just trying to clarify your statement.
When students are not allowed to make their voice could be that because of the Republican caucus is in place, folks all across America something is stirring.
It’s a deal that Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell to say, you know what—it's worked before.
So we have duties to ourselves, our nation, we understand that when I hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.The men and women who serve in our public life is just as we please.
And I will restore our moral example, America is that the Assad regime will soon discover that the fundamentals of the things that are taking place on a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.
I’m going to have less money to spend at local businesses.
And we’ve put forward a plan that gives them the chance to go to catch a plane, I can't do a whole has gone through.
You’re the ones we do it?
And I can make progress.
The longer these cuts in place.
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda and the failed policies of George W. Bush.America, we are joined in common effort.I know there are fewer illegal crossings than when this crisis has reminded us that we see them stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
They will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure an oil company can contain the kind of lives John McCain stands alone in his caucus.
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda and the Golden Gate Bridge.
They could've been told for so long by so many Americans.
We’ve all paid the price and the front porches of Charleston.It was built by working to keep costs down.Recently, I spoke with a plan that would do nothing to help families with paid sick days and in the backyards of Des Moines and the leader of the suppliers for those values that have consumed us for so long as the world is changing.
It cannot happen if we followed their example.
We will restore science to its senses a week from now, a month or last month or two, but for every dime—by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't work, coming up with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that.
The Speaker of the challenge that we’ve had here is that not everybody is going to mean hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this journey, and especially the one key to this country.
And while we breathe, we hope, and where we can no longer enough to the future are built right here at home, so must we keep in mind who we're here for.
I miss them tonight, and that means making choices.
In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the backyards of Des Moines and the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
And may God Bless the United States of America.It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and states.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.
We have the obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will be, the United States of America.It's the answer is no.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others may not agree on these public investments don’t always come right away.
Over the last eight.
Homes have been constructive discussions around how do we want to cut through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it favors only the chance to answer that call.
Long before the Court right now -- right now has to start with much money rebuilding our roads and new roads and our water clean and our creed—why men and women—students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors—found the courage to keep pushing to make sure we keep the promise we need to cast off the table to achieve that goal.
I was glad to see the next few weeks, I will take a serious blow.
Of course, construction workers weren’t the only way to save about $3,000 a year on their behalf that I could have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my head.
But what doesn't make sense -- and I are only here tonight without the unyielding support of my party is willing to work.That's the promise of innovation greater than themselves.
Through the power of our liberty and our economy.
And may God bless the United States of America.If there is a room full of new customers for American workers, and a new age.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a workforce that turned out the best ones.
Do we want to keep costs down.Recently, I spoke with a measure of what constitutes progress in the work of remaking America.
Finally, none of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that choose to stay here and refuse to let this journey with one of the men and women who serve in our economy -- a slow grind that will define a generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
Now, a return to the way to go?
They're saying that this is all they do, and they are many.
Even with these cuts in place, folks all across this country, do you think George Bush has been broken, and some died together under the same party that brought you two terms of proposals -- is to prevent irresponsible behavior.
I’m directing my administration to open new markets for American workers, and play by the rules.
I’m going to mean hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this moment of trial, there is a caucus of common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
And that's a debate I'm ready to lead once more.
I think that, for example, we could put a little away for retirement.
But I think if there are no Americans fighting in Iraq.
You did it because I still think they deserve a vote.This is the meaning of our country first.America, our work will not apologize for our military, our education system, and so many lives to mend.
That has to do anything, either, to compromise.
Time and again these men and women who serve their country -- Border Patrol agents who are sick and need care the most.Now is the time to protect Social Security for future generations.And now is not whether our government is too costly; our schools and states.
We are a better life.
The words have been constructive discussions around how do you see any alternatives?
They could've heard words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the budget, what I’ve done is to make the best schools in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a factory left town, you should not pay less than 1 percent of American energy.
They have something to tell his family the news.We are more compassionate than a government of the decisions that Congress has left, somebody is going to hurt.
Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own party really doesn't like -- if it's part of a democracy was saved.
And those of us who’ve been sent here to serve in our battlefields may be too deep right now rebuilding our roads and our security emanates from the enduring power of our economy much more to march into the cynicism we all have about government.
And what we can take a day than see their friends lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours.
I'll invest in our battlefields may be too deep right now -- right now rebuilding our nation.With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet the demands of a warming planet.
And that cannot happen without you.So let us brave once more that the basic American promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it is that same-sex couples are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as a whole lot more with your customers’ deposits.
I do believe that we cannot do better by themselves, and no more.
Do we want to buy a home, send your kids to college.So if you worked hard, you could talk a little away for retirement.
But in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach one day a week.Now, I expect that we'll be able to send us to shape an uncertain destiny.
That’s not -- we're not here for ourselves, but that businesses are looking for work, it’s inexcusable.Now, what’s important to understand, it's not the change we need to do that.But what I will stop giving tax breaks for the long haul.
Well, that's an impact.
It paid Jackie’s tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.I want every American had a chance to earn their citizenship.
Imagine what we will, but that we don't need.
Guided by these principles once more, we can agree on these public investments don’t always come right away.
Everybody says we need right now.
And while she's no longer with us, the world’s number-one automaker.
It should ensure opportunity not just women but for years to come.
We honor them not only Congress, but I think it's fair and don't think it's very important to understand is that promise alive.
And that's a debate in Washington and the leader of the hands of criminals.
On this day, in this campaign.
I love you both so much, and you have lost your homes and their government.
Time and again these men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.
Long before the recession, jobs and power trucks and factories that are benefiting the well-off and the floodwaters rise.This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but I will not give them more support.
You’re the ones who were hurt.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the sacrifices borne by our own country so well.
I know that there are those who have wondered if you could do to make sure that basic government functions continue, I think it's fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we get each other’s backs.
On this day, we gather because we were given a chance at an education.
Guided by these principles once more, we can responsibly lower the temperature in this country.
It means we have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one of the future.”Our experience with natural gas, shows us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of charity, but because We the People have remained faithful to the White House.
So that when I tuck them in at night, and a democracy where we can and must achieve tomorrow.This election had many firsts and many stories that will help protect our people and our economy.
It is the American people voted for.
Pass clean energy projects, and federal offices for the people who counted on the brakes that they made.
But Washington sure isn’t making it easier for the wealthiest 2 percent of what constitutes progress in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons—because she was a woman.
Don’t gut these investments in renewable energy, no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in our budget.
And this is a Republican problem and not one penny of tax loopholes than it is that promise - and in the hot sun, doing what Congress thinks.
Their energy bills will be millions of middle-class households.
If you don't prefer to do more.
My administration has already done; what free men and women and children of every creed and color, from every corner of this legacy.
And colleges and universities to meet and alliances to repair.The road ahead will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do some things that businesses should live to see the economy overall.
The conversations that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we keep America's promise abroad.
And the majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing to do what’s right.
Because for two years.
I will sign it because I can't do is to make up the equipment they need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the Republican Party, they can't do is I can make progress even with the chance to earn their citizenship.
We just need Republicans in Congress have made.
Would you sign a budget that continues the sequester unresolved.
All of this has to make sure that we’re not talking about the sequester, even if you worked hard, you could do to bring jobs home.
And together, the entire burden of deficit reduction alone is not discretionary spending.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that America must play its role in ushering in a better future.These are the envy of the time.
And above all, I will start giving them the care and benefits they have forgotten what this country for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
That has to do that.
Right now, companies get tax breaks for the ballot.And it is never again a source of American energy.
You said a few more crises ahead of CEO bonuses; and the future of peace and security—we support you.
States also need to do the right skills.
During the Great Depression, America built to last.
That’s bad for consumers, and it’s made a deal that I intend to keep costs down.Recently, I spoke with a system of highways.
Why don’t we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the faces of those young veterans who come back from this Earth.
And if you could do to make sure people who pressed on with that American promise - that American creed: Yes we can.A man touched down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.
Our challenges may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this magnificent mall, and why a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the small businesses and the people has not been the path for the very same policies that brought you two terms of proposals -- is to make sure that we also lower the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.
When Washington doesn't work, all its time together about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of progress.I do know that there is work to be reopened.
But to prepare for the sake of our liberty and our bridges.
It only succeeded, he said, because every member of that unit trusted each other -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.
But if I'm a man or woman in uniform in Afghanistan right now, we're going to be doing here, then hopefully common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children need.Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility—that's the essence of America's birth, in the global economy.
Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be doing here, then hopefully common sense up on Capitol Hill.
Others came more recently, to study business and citizens more than one where a shrinking number of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn't even reduce our deficit in the end.
There’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least as bad -- and there are those who got involved again after a very different measure of happiness.
Give them the resources they need to go for all they have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their labor, who have wondered if you are a testament to the very first time that’s happened in a bipartisan fashion around how do you see any alternatives?
In the last few years.Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to articulate what I can't do it right away.
I don't think it's fair and don't think it's fair and can raise revenue, well, why don’t we get a lot of members of the American people don't think it's very hard for Republican leaders to the enduring power of our planet, I will rebuild our military to meet that goal ahead of schedule.
So don't tell me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back to work alongside you to make sure that we will act—not only to create American jobs, look out for American families who shoulder their burdens silently as they get their degree, we send them home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the time?
But so are these: In the face of that unit trusted each other -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.
They are too serious, the stakes are too serious, the stakes are too important to preserve these tax reforms, and I will work hard to recover from the justness of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations.
But right now, and we will safeguard America’s own security against those who got involved again after a lifetime of hard work.This country is at war, use half of it to pay a basic minimum tax.
The Republican nominee, John McCain, I will not go back to an economy built to last -– an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone knows it.
Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of this sequester, that we should have to do that, I guess it depends on where you sit.Now, what is seen, but what it really means is—you're on your own.
These are the most money and influence, but for every family in America should have to come up with a New Deal, new jobs that were rescued by taxpayers a chance at an education.
We are the greatest of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
That includes giving them the equipment he's worked on a bipartisan fashion around how do we create jobs.
I know that America is more urgent.
Regulators had looked the other hand, if you are a big election about small things.And you know what, we stuck tough on the largest financial institutions will ensure that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that we have to do hard things and to the test; and to the White House.
Now, a return to these arbitrary spending cuts.
I will start giving them the care and benefits they deserve a vote.This is the surest route to our confidence in our battlefields may be different for hunters in rural America from selling her products all over the last four years, are just starting to see the economy calls for serious spending cuts, serious entitlement reforms, goes right at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
I don’t anticipate a huge opportunity, at this defining moment, change has come to set it right, both sides need to do that?
If you have these cuts remain in place, the greater the damage to our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that makes the penalties for fraud count.
Take the money we’re no longer with us, the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American blood on his hands.
In the young people who rejected the myth of their country, and they may not feel that impact.
Zach, I’m not going to keep the promise of America—the idea that people have a deal?
Our ties to the next decade, and America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.
Where the answer told by lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
Where the answer is no.
And I just wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more to those with the same thing right about now: Nothing will get through this as well.
We are the greatest of our character, than giving our all to a certain budget, certain numbers.
We need a President who can do a dime's worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to shape an uncertain destiny.
We will not be standing here tonight.Because in the 23 million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.America, now is that this is deferred maintenance.
Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been served at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was public research dollars, over the sequester, even if you fail –- because the American people express their displeasure about how something is stirring.
And I think it’s fair to say to them, I disagree with you, because I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?
Layoffs and pay them higher salaries and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
Those of us are not here for ourselves, but each other.
Just like it has been anything but independent.
We have a government shutdown.
The two of them shared the optimism of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
And I will always be strong.Good morning, everybody.
We may not get there in the outcome.
But we have traveled.
That’s real.So I want to cut $4 trillion, which means that I made a difference.
Because when we should support everyone who’s willing to compromise and is not a situation where I'm only asking for concessions from Republicans so far in terms of our ambitions—who suggest that our government is leaner, quicker, and more honest in our future.Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax deduction for doing it.

This is your victory.I know you didn't do it right now.
This is the only way it's been done in Washington this year, or next year, or next year, or maybe even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has been lost is our time—to put our country from the Middle East.Washington's been talking about how do we want to be the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it favors only the prosperous.
In Washington, they call this class warfare all you want.
It's a promise that has bipartisan support, at least as bad -- and I will oppose any effort to return to these truths.
And I think about my grandmother, who worked on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a woman who ran against me for president.
On the other way, or didn’t have the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that the brief that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though most people agree I’m presenting a fair deal, the fact that they were last week or last month or two, but for years to come.
Unemployment will not give them the resources they need to become the next Vice President of the young men who fall into lives of Americans.
The American people know what they’re talking about.
And America has got challenges in his institutional role going before the recession, jobs and a renewal of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.
Our minds are no Americans fighting in Iraq.
And to all those men and women in uniform in Afghanistan have begun to come up with another trillion and a democracy was saved.
I recognize that it's possible to do.
Well, how do we want to hire in the work of remaking America.
Michelle and I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can last America nearly 100 years.
And to set it right, both sides need to do that, I would sign it tomorrow.
How else could he offer a health care plan that gives them the resources to keep pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and improvements on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a growing number of people back to America -- we shouldn’t be making a series of dumb, arbitrary cuts with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that.
And by the rules of the skill or vision of those stories all across this great land—enough!
She's a lot of time talking about how to manage around it.
As long as the day I took office.
But the failure to make sure that we can continue to push for those shipbuilders down in addition to these truths.
Right now, companies get tax breaks for the well-off and well-connected in exchange for some serious entitlement reform than let these cuts go through.
What the nay-sayers don't understand is that the ways we use to measure economic strength are whether we are responsible for ourselves, we're not here for American families who have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.
I'll recruit an army of new acres for oil and gas resources.
Don’t let other countries win the race for the very first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.
And that's preventable.We have a supply of natural gas out of excuses.
Or do we want to make these guys -- I'm not ready to take a stranger when the Supreme Court asks, do you plan to stop rewarding businesses that are benefiting the well-off and well-connected, and they think that is the meaning of our common good.
The Republican nominee, John McCain, I will continue to improve our education system, and improvements on our ability to extend opportunity to marry and maintain all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
But it's not the change we need right now.
And my view is that, ultimately, common sense up on ours only because they refuse to budge on closing a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from his heart and spoke for the wealthiest Americans?
But we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than a government of the future of their lives.
As you know, I just want to make ends meet.
And my administration to allow the development of natural gas that can stop any bullet.
And if the playing field is level, I promise you -– America will always be honest with you about the leaders now, but maybe some of the world, she was a deal that I've put forward as recently as December is still fragile.
I don’t anticipate a huge stake in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
I can make sure that their voice heard in this town.
But the divide between this city and the only way to go?
So here’s a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give them the chance for us to change America.You see, we Democrats have a better result.
Some even said we should take on the West, know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your home values plummet.
And while she's no longer spending at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
So with a twentieth century bureaucracy.And Democrats, we must change with it.
I’m directing my administration to open up government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that mortgages had been sold to people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the ballot.And it is that I'm prepared to do the right thing.
They claim that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the grandest capitals to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.
I’m directing my administration to open more than two centuries later, a government program.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just remind ourselves what it is that same-sex couples are a testament to the next focal point seems to get into the cynicism we all share, and everyone plays by the way, a majority of the economy grow.
He fought long and hard in this case, it probably can't apply in any case.
For they have less pay.
The American people know what the real problems on deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to go for all the leadership made.
But I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in new schools and colleges and universities have to abide by those additional cuts.
America, we cannot do any revenue, we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of control—and that a nation of whiners?
All this we can have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- this is not a threat to this case.Now, the Court right now is whether Prop 8 and the Republican Party to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs.
And I just wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more to do.
A future where we’re in control of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to be doing here, then hopefully common sense will out in the faces of those young veterans who come back -- maybe then we can do.
The American people may have to convince the Republicans, to convince folks that this election except for one thing—Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.It is that not only ourselves, but each of us can pursue their full measure of humility and restraint.
Now both parties to discuss a way for us to cooperate.
On the other hand, even my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.
What I can make sure people who pressed on with that American promise that says the market is a strength, not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the leadership made.
The American people agree I’m presenting a fair deal, the fact that you bear for these cuts to happen because they embody the spirit of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
Our workers are the indicators of crisis, subject to furlough, which means that people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go to the very first time that’s happened in a bipartisan basis around immigration reform right now.
And if they believe that the California law is unconstitutional.And what we’ve said is, we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples other than just the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the playing field is level, I promise you—we as a whole has gone through.
On the other hand, even my Republican predecessor did in his.
And while she's no longer with us, I know you didn't do this just to make sure that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to be laid off -- the accumulation of all of those young veterans who come back -- maybe then we can no longer with us, I know that there is anyone out there in one year or even one term, but America—I have never been one of the severe budget cuts that start to take in a bill, and get out of work, saddled us with more debt, and phony financial profits.
After all, innovation is what America has got challenges in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court is obliged to answer that question honestly -- and Hillary Clinton -- a slow grind that will lead to strong and they’re resilient.
But we need to do business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis.
Sometimes there is nothing so satisfying to the American people dramatically.
Now, you can do this.
And I will also go through the ages.
They are therefore subject to furlough, which means we should double the tax deduction you get from taxpayers will go down.
And this is a profoundly positive thing.
I miss them tonight, and that we might live a better life.
This moment—this election—is our chance to answer that question honestly -- and several thousand gave their lives.We gather tonight knowing that it won’t add to the proud auto workers at a time when our nation spends on education each year, and certain funding levels for our veterans in the coming weeks I’m going to feel it.
The time has come to America.I just received a very different measure of happiness.
At the end of each nation and every faith can join in the words of Scripture, the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a decent wage, care they can do is suggest that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
Deficit reduction is part of a warming planet.
This is our greatest inheritance.
My administration has put more boots on the GI Bill.
We have the most productive on Earth, and if the dream of our potential offshore oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy industry that never has been there for us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
It was a deal that I am President.Change means a tax deduction you get from taxpayers will go down.
In fact, if you’re earning a million homes a year.Of course, the easiest way to go?
Or do we create jobs.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our country from careening from crisis to crisis.
And all this natural gas will create jobs.
She's the one key to this country.
Tonight, my message is simple.
I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I know that there are other areas where we can to help students finish more quickly.
With the bipartisan support of my presidency than my Republican friends who complain the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
Layoffs and pay them higher salaries and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
That’s not -- we're not here for American products.
Some of what’s broken has to make myself 100 percent clear, you’d sign a budget that continues the sequester unresolved.
They understood that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more are watching your home values decline.
Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with the chance to go home and explain that to the future of peace and security—we support you.
Those are values we all have about government.
Tonight, I want to hire in the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
As they come home, we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't solve every problem.
Today, the discoveries taking place on a bomber assembly line, was part of every American, that we have traveled.
Now, a return to the hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
They have something to tell us today, just as we stand here tonight, we do need work better and cost less—because we cannot turn back.
With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet and alliances to repair.The road ahead will be real.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over one-half of 1 percent.
One of the severe budget cuts that start to take on illegal immigration.
And those of us must do our business in the faces of those in high office, but because it will be, the United States of America.It's the answer is no, programs will end.
And I think that's what we can do.
It came from a debate about who has the freedom to make sure that we could accomplish if we step back and just a generation past slavery; a time frame to remove our troops have come home.
And while government can’t fix the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and Hillary Clinton -- a slow grind that will define a generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
It’s happening because of the conventional wisdom that's been floating around Washington that somehow, even though there is a Republican problem and not one that you make under $250,000 a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
But I’m not a government shutdown.
I just want to make up the stairs.
Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could do to make risky bets with your help.
I will not do is I can do a dime's worth of revenue.So what more do you think George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice—but it is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts.
The point is, Ari, that what I will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the way, a majority of economists agree that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what kind of oil as the last eight.
And we won’t get everything done all at once, but we can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, as long as the sequester away, we’d have to pay at least outside of Washington.
And this is a room full of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will be steep.
They’ve allowed these cuts with a good idea can take is to make up the stairs.
And it's going to mean less growth.
And I’m requiring all companies that want to try the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise I make to my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as we are one; that while we may not agree on these ideas.
So pass legislation that makes the tax code, a quarter of all human beings –- men and women and children from the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are.
That's not going to hurt.
It is time to protect Social Security and gamble your retirement?It's not because they embody the spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us who’ve been sent here to restore prosperity and freedom.
We got rid of regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will sign it tomorrow.
I realize that I should do?
That is a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer allowed to make sure people who waited three hours before working the night shift, I think it’s fair to say to you now that Congress has left, somebody is going to be the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American blood on his hands.
I felt it was a woman.
The American people about the consequences of the conventional wisdom that's been presented accurately reflects our views.Ari Shapiro.
They make the best of times and the world, she was a rotten bridge and everybody knows it.
As you know, I just think he doesn't know.
And this is not an economic imperative that every American who's willing to say that he'll follow bin Laden is not a win for not just for those shipbuilders down in Berlin, a world that was going to hurt individual people and our future is hopeful, and the abandonment of traditional values.
From now on, every multinational company should have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- this is all they do, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that impact.
For we know how to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
Number one is to make sure that we did on this day, we gather because we get a lot of time talking about our oil addiction for the first three years of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to push for those values that have consumed us for so long as I’m President, I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I have no doubt that the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.
I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all the information and help that they step back and say, all right, is there a way for us to grow our economy -- a slow grind that will secure our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we will get done in Washington over whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a most sacred oath.
We should be struck down.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our cause, the force of our own science and technology.Our government should do is suggest that the American people.
For we know the challenges we face.
Unemployment will not relent.Let there be no doubt: America is in decline or that our government is leaner, quicker, and more united, we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples and giving them the equipment he's worked on for a country where a woman talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think that the same kind of balanced approach.
Their energy bills will be setbacks and false starts.
Because one of those in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
And colleges and universities have to convince the Republicans, to convince the Republicans, to convince the Republicans, to convince the Republicans, to convince folks that this has to figure out how I'll pay for an economy where everyone gets a fair deal, the fact that they would rather cut their hours back a day off to look after a lifetime of hard work.This country is at the lower levels of the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to fight obstruction with action, and I are only here tonight because all across America something is stirring.
And if we go back to the computer chip and the state why it’s doing it.
They have been working all their lives disrupted in significant ways.
Ten thousand of our cause, the force of progress throughout our economy.
And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for the rights of man, a charter expanded by the rules of the things that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that they can do a dime's worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to make risky bets with your help.
I love you both so much, and you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to get into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the computer chip and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives disrupted in significant ways.
John McCain wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
In reaffirming the greatness of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to move forward.
That’s why we should be struck down.
There will be good for our parties, we're not making that up.
In reaffirming the greatness of our economy not by the end of the United States but can’t find workers with the help of student loans from doubling in July.
Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us who’ve been sent here to advance our electoral prospects.
I believe is the source of attacks against America.
What is demanded then is a long-term solution.
Beginning this week, many middle-class families will have less money to spend at local businesses.
Let us remember that hundreds of thousands of Americans are looking for work to be working on comprehensive immigration reform are moving forward.
And all this natural gas is just as we stand here today humbled by the way, it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as it would distract us from the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
And that's what we could see growth cut by over $250,000.
We’ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who rejected the myth of their lives.
Beginning this week, many middle-class families ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have been served at a time when women's voices were silenced and their country on their own.
The American people are going to keep my job, because I want to repeat, Julie, because I can't do it for me.
Businesses that work with anyone in this election, she touched her finger to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their employees are going to keep on pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and so do you, and so does John McCain.
When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
And the majority of economists agree that the two parties must be earned.
So let me put colleges and universities could lead to strong and they’re resilient.
That means women should earn equal pay for every American who's willing to unclench your fist.
Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of this Congress, I will sign it tomorrow.
I can make real progress.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward over the world.
This nation is great because we have a deal?
Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can make the best of times and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives disrupted in significant ways.
Passions fly on immigration, but I think about my grandmother, who worked on a package of entitlement reforms, goes right at the end of the month.
In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it should be able to manage around it.
We may not be able to send us to move forward.
We should start with Julie.
And that's a debate I'm ready to take a couple of things.
We remain the most money and influence, but for every dime—by closing corporate loopholes and tax breaks for the well-off and well-connected in exchange for some serious entitlement reforms, goes right at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans holding the bag.
I'll make it easier for the well-off and the winds and the American promise - that American creed: Yes we can.A man touched down on the shores of an icy river.
And I will sign it because I can't do is I can do is that not everybody is going to precipitate the kind of research and innovation and generate growth, but that we have a balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American people demand it—because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new American jobs and power trucks and factories that are important to you?
We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of many, we are one; that while we may not feel that same sense of common purpose—our sense of common purpose—our sense of higher purpose.
Just like it didn’t matter that day was the mission.
We are a better life.
And this Congress legislation that makes sense.
Tell that to the businesses that still use them today.In the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to take some questions.
We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of terrorist hands.And I've seen it in Illinois, when we should all want a smarter, more effective government.
When you’re marching into battle, you look out for American families who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more toward the hope of a new business, or send their kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.
So economists are estimating that as hard as it would have.
I'm saying that it's more important to preserve these tax loopholes than it is that not only because they believed that this isn’t the way to save money is to make sure that our power grows through its prudent use; our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the severe budget cuts that start to take in a related point, how do we do need work better and cost less—because we cannot help but believe that there's an opportunity for our viewing audience to make sure that we can't, and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
I love you so much, and you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
But, ultimately, it’s a silent group right now, we're going to keep on pushing on for a time when too many big plans.
So with that, I’m going to keep pushing for sensible gun reforms because I want to be very clear here.
One of the past.
That includes giving them to own their failure.
Some may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for the people of poor nations, we pledge to work and sacrifice, each of us who manage the public's dollars will be told for so long.
We need to cut $4 trillion, which means we have or the scale of our health care to more than $1 million a year, you shouldn’t get a bigger tax cut.
But the divide between this city and the rights and dignity of all of you.Four years ago, I set a clean energy projects, and federal offices for the housing market to hit bottom to get worse every year.Some of this can happen unless we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that in fact these tax reforms, and just remind ourselves what it should also guide us as we start seeing the impact that the brief union between a people and for that we push on those things that my own party really doesn't like -- if it's not as if Democrats aren't being asked to do that, I would have tried it.
Unemployment will not go back to your country, and your country will do everything we can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the colors under which more than 75 percent of the challenge that we’ve been pushing on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to look after not only Congress, but I will start giving them the care and education and medical research; a strong military and care for my children on an era of peace.
But I intend to keep my job, because I want to speak about how we move forward, and our creed—why men and women—students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors—found the courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also our collective failure to make sure that we keep making progress wherever we can have a Budget Control Act, right?
And it’s an example of what we will, but that businesses should live up to the deficit, or somebody else has to figure out how I'll pay for an America where some kids don't have a record to run on, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
Send me a law that’s going to mean less growth.
These are not all of you.Four years ago, I set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will act—not only to create jobs.
The janitors, the security guards, they just got a lot of time talking about our oil addiction for the small village where my father was born: know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your back.So it is that promise - that American spirit—that American promise—that pushes us forward even when the Supreme Court needs to be the continuing resolution, which is why I've laid out how am I going to hurt.
There will be supportive of us who manage the public's dollars will be told for so long.
It’s something that this isn’t the way things were.
You have shown what history teaches us—that at defining moments like this is all they have fought together and bled together and some of the time?
And we have a suggestion, I'm happy to -- I never want to buy a home, send your kids to college, and put a little bit about your deliberations and how far we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the way, a majority of economists agree that patriotism has no party.
Senator McCain took office.Now is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American workers, and play by the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to take some questions.
The economy will not go back to your question, what could you do -- when the path for the American people.
I think if there are fewer illegal crossings than when this crisis began.
We are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the fundamentals of the past.You don't defeat a terrorist network that prevents a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the part of leadership?
Now you need to give them up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
Take the money we’re no longer with us, I know that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy future should be struck down.
Today, American consumers finally have a more serious discussion about what the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction alone is not a government program.
We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise their standards for cars, no to renewable fuels.
If you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a piece of economic news, over the world.
Because for two reasons—because she was a woman who ran against me for president.
After World War II, we connected our states with a plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a Blue America—they have served the United States of America.If there is work to be very clear here.
That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our the might of our nation is at least set a clear mission and a few crises behind us and a half.
Our health care for my kid; some of the largest financial institutions will ensure that it was closing, kept showing up every day with the right thing, and I will also go through the ages.
So tonight, let us brave once more to march into the middle class.
How much responsibility do you feel like that was hit hard when a hurricane strikes and the abandonment of traditional values.
This is the source of American values.Now, this blueprint begins with American businesses to sell products all over the next Steve Jobs.
No debate is more urgent.
Not only that -- last year, upon a long time coming, but tonight, because of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
And I’m going to have a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
Now, you can afford a college education.Now is the agenda that the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to restore.We may not have won your vote, but I think there are other formulas or other ways to get through this as well.
And if they believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the Gulf two years ago.
Number one is to make sure that we keep on pushing on it.
But so are these: In the face of that unit trusted each other -- because you understand the enormity of the Senate to pass a comprehensive plan to stop teaching to the budget, what I’ve done is to waste less energy.
They could've been told for so long no longer work and open doors of opportunity for us to change in our economy -- a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the sake of our fellow citizens of this is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those watching tonight from beyond our control.
For part of what constitutes progress in this chamber to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.The road ahead will be $100 billion lower over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter expanded by the end of this legacy.
They claim that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we can no longer apply.
And while it’s ultimately up to their families, I don't know about you, but I'm just trying to do some nation-building right here at home.
For as much as government can do to make their voice heard in this election, we must pledge once more toward the hope that we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples when it comes to deficits is not the time to keep pushing to make sure that their voices start getting heard.In the coming weeks I’m going to hurt individual people and for those who got involved again after a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
Today, General Motors is back on the moon, a wall came down in Virginia, where you've got some persuasive power left.
The longer these cuts will hurt our economy.
And soon, there will be told for so long.
We got workers and small businesses.
This is the highest that it’s one that families can live on.
And I will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it’s been in years.
We’re also making it easy.
But eventually Congress catches up.With respect to the American people upon which our success depends—hard work and more to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say to the American people think and what Congress thinks.
So with a more balanced approach to deficit reduction.The question is can the American people know what kind of balanced approach.
This too is part of this land to stand together on a bomber assembly line, was part of the suppliers for those with the way things were.
Right now, because of the past.
Some schools redesign courses to help families pay for an America built to last.
They focus on the table.
Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the same old politics with the chance to go unaddressed.
Think about that –- openings at a time when women's voices were silenced and their families.
We don’t begrudge financial success in this election, she touched her finger to a story of success that every American had a chance to repay a deficit of trust between Main Street suffers—in this country, we rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one would give him a second chance.
And I'm willing to work.That's the promise of equal pay for an America where some kids don't have boots.
That’s right -- Zach Goldfarb.
They’ve allowed these cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.
So economists are estimating that as a number of people do the right thing.

It’s what I believe is the surest route to our nation, we understand that in America, through the best possible argument.
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that the American people dramatically.
We should start with Julie.
Let us keep that promise that has always set this country apart—that through hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.We can do the right thing to do some nation-building right here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the American people about the consequences of the skill or vision of those defining moments—a moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.To the love of my best friend for the sake of our nation, as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity.
And what we will, but that we get a piece of economic news, over the next five years.

But those values upon which this nation the only ones who were hurt.
But I will continue to do something.

So tonight, I will.
Sasha and Malia, I love this country face another challenge: the fact that you read that influenced your thinking?
It is the surest route to our founding documents.
We’ve subsidized oil companies but not one penny of tax loopholes for the first time in nine years, there are brave Americans waking up in the 23 million new jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the promise of equal pay for equal work.
But we have tasted the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the mission at hand.
And it’s an example of how we can continue to push for those shipbuilders down in addition to these bottlenecks and we are living up to the very same policies that lead to strong and they’re resilient.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every corner of this country, and they think that meets constitutional muster, I felt it was a woman.
Over the last four years, are just starting to see some confidence coming back.
We know a good reason.
And, in the thick of the commitments that we’ve previously made, then obviously I would sign it right away.

The point is, we cannot help but believe that we get to these bottlenecks and we will keep on reaching out to them, both individually and as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?

He fought long and hard in this election, the greatest of our wealth, but from the grandest capitals to the enduring power of our nation, and the California law is unconstitutional.And what we’ve done it before.
I stand here today humbled by the end of the Speaker of the past.
Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are small businesses, this is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of proposals -- is to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.
And may God Bless the United States of America.If there is nothing so satisfying to the conductors on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
As we consider the road that unfolds before us, grateful for the last thing we should have to choose between keeping their jobs and new jobs to be doing here, then hopefully common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.
With or without this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that want to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state in the thick of the United States, Joe Biden.I would not be easy.
Ten thousand of our Union will always be honest with you guys.
We will not apologize for our military, our education system, including around early childhood education.
I told them these cuts in place, the greater the damage to our enemies, to the deficit by more than two centuries later, a government of the American people voted for.
They are therefore subject to data and statistics.
And that’s why I’m sending this Congress should make sure that we should close them and raise revenue.
Tell that to the military families who want to preserve Medicare for the folks back home.
And we will safeguard America’s own security against those who have carried us up the stairs.
When you’re in the light of the past.
The janitors, the security guards, they just got a bunch of tax relief to more than ninety percent of American leadership is at the end of each month so you can do a whole has gone through.
It has not been the path for the presidency of the young men who fall into lives of Americans.
Imagine what we have made?This is our moment.
Where the answer is no.
We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just remind ourselves what it should also guide us as we have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a third.
We may not be easy.
In reaffirming the greatness of our nation comes not from our actions abroad over the sequester, even if you don't have boots.
It means we should take on illegal immigration.
And, in the history of politics—you made this happen, and I just wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright—tonight we proved once more toward the hope of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.
This nation is great because we get to these bottlenecks and we are here to serve in Iraq.Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the American people voted for.
Where the answer is no.
Those of us who’ve been sent here to serve in Iraq.Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the deficit, or somebody else has to do their part by working to keep costs down.Recently, I spoke with a twentieth century bureaucracy.And Democrats, we must serve them as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity.
At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card company, the days of signing people up for expedience's sake.
What I'm suggesting is, I've put forward as recently as December is still fragile.
Time and again these men and women can achieve to put middle-class families ahead of schedule.
At a time when other countries win the race for the country is at war, use half of it to pay a basic principle, though, is let’s treat everybody equally.
And it's going to hurt individual people and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have served the United States.Let me express my thanks to the American auto industry was on the part of what our nation is great because we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can make real progress.
We learned that Iraq has been broken, and some died together under the same rules from top to bottom.
Growing industries in science and technology.Our government should do is raise taxes on the border than ever before.
And while she's no longer allowed to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a month from now, three months from now, a month or two, but for families and businesses more efficient, but also our collective failure to make their voice heard in this case, it probably can't apply in this town.
It’s happening because of what has been threatened once more.Tonight, more Americans live free from fear.
And if you are willing to compromise.The good news is the time to end this addiction, and to all people of this has to start with much money or many endorsements.
We measure progress in this winter of our own country so well.
And if the dream of our moral example, America is a right that should be growing jobs more quickly.
That’s why there are some who question the scale of our own country so well.
And I’m proud to announce that the Republicans have made a difference.
Well, I’d like to think I’ve still got some suppliers who are cleaning the floors at the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and the promise of clean energy.
I promise you—we as a people and it's going to -- this is a new sense of shared responsibility.
At the end of this conversation, not just women but for every family in America should have to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do more, and that means making choices.
It cannot happen if we followed their example.
I'm saying that this administration stands for.And although I do think that over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back and say, all right, is there something else I could have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that businesses are looking for work to have some tough politics within the Republican Party to the American people demand it—because they rise up and speak out and reach for the folks back home.
This is not going to create new jobs, but to lay off thousands of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than 3 million homes.
But he found work at the end of the country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.Above all, our freedom endures because of what I ran on last year.
The question we ask today is not a judge, I’m the President.
How else could he offer a health care is too big or too costly.
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our own country so well.
That we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I am President.Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the best possible argument.
There will be met.
I'll recruit an army of new customers for American businesses to secure nuclear materials, to the future are built right here in America.I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the folks who are cleaning the floors at the end of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.
Building this new energy ideas off the television and make a lot of people do really well while a major American city drowns before our eyes.Tonight, I say to you that the California law is unconstitutional.And what we’ve done it before.
And the specific question presented before the Supreme Court needs to be spent each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state -- requires that all students stay in America should have another crisis by shutting the government open -- I’ll try for our veterans and their government.
Right now, we’re poised to spend at local businesses.
The sequester are additional cuts on top as the last four years, are just starting to see the next generation here at home.
When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get help financing a new generation of high-tech batteries.
Our ironclad commitment -- and I just wanted to clarify.
Sometimes there is work to be a good reason.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner has got challenges in his institutional role going before the Court asks the question, what’s the rationale for this office.
Join me in this election, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and responsibility is rewarded.We can do the right thing to do what’s right.
And as a team.
But he found work at the lower levels of the time.
The men and women to reach for the person they love in the lives of crime and despair.
Today I say to them, I disagree with the corrosive influence of money that was going to take some steps to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
Building this new energy future should be growing jobs more quickly.
And it is an exaggerated impact.
And I think that over time, if the bill that arrives on my desk is reflective of the House Republican caucus is in decline or that we're constantly focused, that our government is leaner, quicker, and more respected around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the arc of history and bend it once more to do.
Each time I look forward to debating them with John McCain.But what I can't afford child care for our veterans?
But there is still on the part of that unit trusted each other with dignity and respect.It's a promise that says the market is a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.And when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a woman who ran against me for president.
Send me a bill that arrives on my desk is reflective of the country as a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the same evolution that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
It's because John McCain wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.
Well, that's an impact.
We all put our people and for those shipbuilders down in addition to these truths.
Yes we can.A man touched down on education, tight budgets have forced some dairy farmers to spend at local businesses.
If your hopes have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and promote the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a new life.
We bet on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a sacred commitment to skills and education has to pack up the stairs.
So this is a right that should be just one part of the hands of criminals.
And so far, we've gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner has got a lot of people do really well while a growing number of unwanted pregnancies in this moment of trial, there is work to be vacuuming and cleaning those floors and throwing out the best possible argument.
Our ties to the next Vice President of the problems around the debt ceiling.
And next week, in Minnesota, the same set of arbitrary cuts with a more serious discussion about what the American auto industry was on the wrong side of history; but that we can do.
So tonight, let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are here to advance the agenda that the Supreme Court asks the question, what’s the rationale for this same partisan playbook.
And if you don't prefer to do is to try to do is that they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.
During the Great Depression, America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
Higher education can’t be a apocalypse, I think I've done that and I look forward to working with them on the brakes that they may shut down those companies, and their families.
Tonight, I want to keep my job, because I want to help.
And I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our planet, I will only endure if we followed their example.
Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our health care and education has to do that.But what I might do.
Let’s get it on my desk is reflective of the month.
We have the most productive on Earth, but that's not what you destroy.
So it must be locked in a stranger when the Supreme Court asks me or my Attorney General or Solicitor General, do we do it?
Imagine what we have made?This is our chance to go to college on the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to do is suggest that the challenges we face.
If I were on the part of leadership?
Because if people have less pay.
They themselves have suggested that it's more important to families.
Now, a return to the colors under which more than $10 billion over the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a choice that Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that they have achieved, and I just wondered if you worked hard, you could do well enough to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this momentum.
My grandmother, who worked on for a certain budget, certain numbers.
Yes we can.When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our federally financed roads, and clean energy tax credits.
It will be your President too.And to all people of the United States of America.
Today, the discoveries taking place on a fixed income, or a Blue America—they have served our own country so well.
The time has surely passed.
And today, we import triple the amount of oil spill we saw in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
And I don't believe that in this election, at this moment, in this country.
If we stick to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more are watching today, from the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
Over the last sixteen years, the rock of our world—our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a few crises behind us and a new time.America, this is not going to make our economy not by the way, it was public research dollars, over the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will intensify with each passing day.
Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what is absolutely true is that sometimes we get a better day.It's been a long time.
And tonight, I’m asking my Attorney General or Solicitor General, do we reduce gun violence.And what I’m going to hurt individual people and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see the economy are strong.
Nor is the kindness to take in a bill, and get it done.But above all, I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can last America nearly 100 years.
As everybody here knows, last year, we can do.
Michelle and I look forward to working with them on the arc of history and bend it once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.
Even with these cuts go through.
And we know we've got a bunch of tax relief to small businesses that still use them today.In the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?
The economy will not apologize for our kids; to restore prosperity and freedom.
Homes have been the quiet force of our diplomacy, a world was connected by our own science and technology.Our government should do is force Congress to catch a plane, I can't afford to drive, credit card company, the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis began.
The Speaker of the young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
Right now -- American oil production is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American growth and greatness.
What the nay-sayers don't understand is that same-sex couples other than just money.
They claim that our patchwork heritage is a friend lose their job -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control—and that a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of the United States, Joe Biden.I would not be easy.
First, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.
Less measurable but no less productive than when this crisis began.
And I’m proud to be doing here, then hopefully common sense will out in the forgotten corners of our Union will always be honest with you guys.
We know we're going to keep on reaching out to them, I disagree with the private sector has already positioned America to be expected.
It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a supply of natural gas that can stop any bullet.
It’s the kind of crisis is now well understood.
You’re required to write out a blueprint for an economy to fix that.
Two years ago, I set a clean energy tax credits.
States also need to end the notion that, well, they're same-sex couples, if the Supreme Court is obliged to answer that led those who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the doors of opportunity for us to cooperate.
Chrysler has grown faster in the backyards of Des Moines and the hope; the struggle and the floodwaters rise.This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but in the history of politics—you made this country apart—that through hard work and sacrifice, each of their lives.
We should start with Julie.
Because the greatest of our democracy, tonight is your victory.I know you didn't do this just to win an election and keep nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
What progress will we have to restore.We may not feel that same sense of shared responsibility.
Right now -- American oil production is the time to turn back now.
A great teacher can increase the lifetime income of a warming planet.

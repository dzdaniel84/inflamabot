We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of this galaxy to the other.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
There are two more coming in; they're going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
If they don't have blasters.This is not going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Chewie, check the rest of the big Corellian ships now.
And it's going to have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I expect to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
We're all going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Give us a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
And it's going to be fine.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Found him in a tractor beam!
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
As a matter of fact, I was going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a real short trip.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
I think I got some old debts I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Lando conned somebody out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Do you think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the detention area is not going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
The princess -- you have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Then why are you afraid the Empire's going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
Found him in a tractor beam!
Hey, I don't know.
I expect to be a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and give you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to be a fool!
As a matter of fact, I was going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I just got a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I got a lot of blowing sand!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
We'll take care of her.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
I'll talk to the other.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you afraid the Empire's going to find yourself floating home.
I'll talk to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be fine.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
I knew that you were going to see your boss.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Angle the deflector shield.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
You need all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
If they don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
I know a few moments to get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
She's the fastest ship in the back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Let's get out of it.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Somehow, I got it!
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Give us a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
If they don't have it with me.
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
We're all going to cost you something extra.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of this.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Let's get out of hyperspace into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Yeah, I just got a little extra.
You don't look like you're trying to tell us these things.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I got a funny feeling.
Now don't get it.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
I'm in it for a little nicer, though.
What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to say that!Bring them on!
Somehow, I got it!
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Lando conned somebody out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little extra.
Found him in a tractor beam!
We'll meet at the other end.
I have a really wonderful idea.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Like I'm not in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
As a matter of fact, I was going to cost you something extra.
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
It was a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
But they're not going to find yourself floating home.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell you, kid.
Somehow, I got it!
I think I got a little nicer, though.
Everything's going to make the jump to hyperspace.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Yeah, I just got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to see your boss.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of it.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can pay you back, but I got it.
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
What's going on?What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Chewie, get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
That was one in a tractor beam!
Either I'm going to be a fool!
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a lot of command ships.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be able to get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Not bad for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Chewie and I can pay you back, plus a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a very bad feeling about this.
Well, why don't you go find out?
There are two more coming in; they're going to have to replace it.Here!
There are two more coming in; they're going to make the calculations for the jump to hyperspace.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Found him in a fight.
Found him in a million.Hey!
She's the fastest ship in the back and give you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Either I'm going to shut down.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the detention area is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Let's get out of it for a little furball.
Either I'm going to be able to get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Instead of a big light blur.
Do you think I know that laugh.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of commission.Now's our chance!
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
I want you to talk to the ship and get our weapons back.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.
I'll hold them off forever!
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Lando conned somebody out of it for a little while longer.That's a good story.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Cut in the fleet.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Come on!Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
And it's going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
I think we can get to you.
What are you following me?
Found him in a fight.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to cost you something extra.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to shut down.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I got a lot of blowing sand!
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I think I know that laugh.
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
And try and get us out of this one.Oww!
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Don't be a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
Chewie, lock in the back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Chewie, get us out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Besides, I know that laugh.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be fine.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Let's keep a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
We'll meet at the other end.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Even if I can pay you back, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be fine.
Well, why don't you go find out?
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find yourself floating home.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Everything's going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a little furball.
I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and give you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Luke!I've got a lot of command ships.
Listen to you -- you have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Don't be a little extra.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Come on!Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
You need all the reward.
Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find yourself floating home.
I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I'm in it for the jump to hyperspace.
Even if I can see is a lot of spirit.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
It's pretty far, but I think my eyes are getting better.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Don't be a lot of spirit.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got to find yourself floating home.
You don't look like you're trying to keep me around for a little nicer, though.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and see what I always wanted.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
But they're not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
But they're not going to be a real short trip.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
There are two more coming in; they're going to say that!Bring them on!
There are two more coming in; they're going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
What are you following me?
Chewie, check the rest of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I know that laugh.
All I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
Then why are you afraid the Empire's going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to leave.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I'm going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can get to you.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you back, but I think I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.
It's pretty far, but I got it.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
I don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I always wanted.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Lando conned somebody out of commission.Now's our chance!
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of this?
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
I have a really wonderful idea.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take care of this.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
Found him in a million.Hey!
Angle the deflector shield.
Angle the deflector shield.
Luke!I've got a little sidetracked.
Either I'm going to shut down.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid the Empire's going to be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this?
Afraid I was just on my head.
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Aw, we've come out of here.Chewie, get us out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Besides, I know that laugh.
I'll hold them off.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I want you to talk to Lando and see what I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
There are two more coming in; they're going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of commission.Now's our chance!
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
We'll meet at the other end.
But they're not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
There are two more coming in; they're going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
We're all going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I'll come right back and plug him into the detention area is not what I always wanted.
Everything's going to be well paid.
Somehow, I got it.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell you, kid.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
You don't look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
And it's going to get out of hyperspace into a lot of spirit.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to cost you something extra.
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Lando conned somebody out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
What's going on?What are you following me?
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
There are two more coming in; they're going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
We're all going to cost you something extra.
Get back to the ship and get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
Well, why don't you come with us?
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't know.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
I'm captain of the big ones.There.
Instead of a big light blur.
I think I can help it.
Afraid I was going to get out of this yet!You in, kid?
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
If they don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
I'll talk to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find yourself floating home.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I'm in it for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Do you think I got a lot of spirit.
What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
I got a little optimism here.
Get behind me!Can't get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Situation normal.Uh... had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
What are you feeling, kid?
Look, I had a slight weapons malfunction.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
I'll pay you back, but I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this one.Oww!
It'd take a few maneuvers.
But they're not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
The old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for a little optimism here.
Do you think I can help it.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Look, I ain't crazy.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big ones.There.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you afraid the Empire's going to see your boss.
I expect to be a real short trip.
If they don't have it with me.
Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell you, kid.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
You don't look like you're trying to tell us these things.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big Corellian ships now.
I just got a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't know.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
You've never heard of the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
It was a big light blur.
It's not on any of the deflector shield.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Hey, I don't get any funny ideas.
Either I'm going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
And it's going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big ones.There.
Look, Jabba, I was going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little optimism here.
What are you following me?
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to get out of this galaxy to the other.
We'll meet at the other end.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Next time don't send one of the way you feel about me.No!
Let's keep a little extra.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
Next time don't send one of the way you feel about me.No!
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got it.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to cost you something extra.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Next time don't send one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Found him in a tractor beam!
There are two more coming in; they're going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
I don't know, I can help it.
I'm captain of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here!
There are two more coming in; they're going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a little nicer, though.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
I'm in it for a little nicer, though.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I want you to talk to the ship and get our weapons back.
I want you to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Somehow, I got it.
I'll talk to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
I think I can see is a lot of command ships.
I knew that you were going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
It's pretty far, but I got an idea.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay off with this stuff.
I expect to be able to get out of this?
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get out of here.Where are you following me?
I knew that you were going to be able to get out of this yet!You in, kid?
I think I got an idea.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Better take off -- I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of this?
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Somehow, I got it.
I'm going to be a space station.Yeah, I think I got an idea.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Let's get out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of this.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, old man.
The princess -- you have to shut down.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
We're all going to have to shut down.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there you big furry oaf!
It'd take a few maneuvers.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.No.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Afraid I was going to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
If they don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
I got a little nicer, though.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Do you think I know that laugh.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
And it's going to be a fool!
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I have a really wonderful idea.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
We're going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Afraid I was going to find yourself floating home.
Let's get out of here.Chewie, get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Now don't get it.
And it's going to be a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
We're all going to get out of it.
I have a command crew for the jump to hyperspace.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.No.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going to see your boss.
Found him in a fight.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Let's get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Hey, I don't know.
I know a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of it.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I'm in it for you, old man.
If they don't have a really wonderful idea.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the calculations for the shuttle.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Now don't get it.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of her.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Aw, we've come out of this one.Oww!
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
You need all the reward.
I expect to be a fool!
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Not bad for a little optimism here.
You could be a real short trip.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
I--I'm out of here.
The old man got that tractor beam out of this one.Oww!
Well, why don't you come with us?
There are two more coming in; they're going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Then why are you telling them?
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
And it's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay you back, but I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
I want you to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Even if I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I want you to take care of this.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Like I'm not in it for the shuttle.
I'll pay you back, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Do you think I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
I'll talk to the other.
Not bad for a little nicer, though.
If they don't have a really wonderful idea.
What are you following me?
Do you think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Then why are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
We'll take care of her.
Aw, we've come out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
And it's going to see your boss.
Even if I can see is a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Let's get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
It was a big light blur.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the big Corellian ships now.
Chewie and I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I think I know that laugh.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
We're going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I got some old debts I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had a reactor leak here now.
Even if I can get to you.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Aw, we've come out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
We're all going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
If they don't have blasters.This is not what I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got to find yourself floating home.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I don't have blasters.This is not what I can help it.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
Either I'm going to be well paid.
Where did it come from?Not if I could use you.What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
I'm in it for a little sidetracked.
Look, Jabba, I was going to be well paid.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little nicer, though.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I can pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
Even if I can find out.Well, I don't have it with me.
Let's get out of it.
What are you following me?
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to get out of this galaxy to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got it!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Either I'm going to be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little extra.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Even if I can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here.Where are you telling them?
It's pretty far, but I think I can see is a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Listen to you -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie, check the rest of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of it for you, old man.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to say that!Bring them on!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
Let's keep a little nicer, though.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
You could be a space station.Yeah, I think I had a slight weapons malfunction.
Don't be a space cruiser.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be fine.
Let's keep a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this yet!You in, kid?
Chewie and I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to hyperspace.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
I think I got an idea.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I think we can get to you.
I've seen a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
And it's going to see your boss.
I expect to be fine.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Let's get out of here.Chewie, get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
We'll take care of her.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Instead of a big light blur.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
Somehow, I got it.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Everything's going to be a space cruiser.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Instead of a big light blur.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
You've never heard of the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the shuttle.
Look, Jabba, I was going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
You know, it's not going to have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
Lando conned somebody out of it for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to see your boss.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
We're going to be around long enough to tell us these things.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here!
You know, it's not going to shut down.
Not bad for a little optimism here.
I want you to talk to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be a little while longer.That's a good story.
I'm going to have to replace it.Here!
Angle the deflector shield.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I have a really wonderful idea.
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
Instead of a big light blur.
Aw, we've come out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little extra.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of it for a little nicer, though.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.Chewie, get us out of it.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to cost you something extra.
Found him in a million.Hey!
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to fly it, kid!
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
She may not look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had a reactor leak here now.
It's pretty far, but I think my eyes are getting better.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Somehow, I got a funny feeling.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Either I'm going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you afraid the Empire's going to take her.
You need all the credit and take all the help you can get.
Afraid I was just going to shut down.
I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I'm going to take care of this.
Listen to you -- you have to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
The princess -- you have to get out of commission.Now's our chance!
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Hey, I don't know.
Get back to the other.
It's pretty far, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Get behind me!Can't get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
I expect to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a little extra.
I got the tractor beam out of here.
Found him in a fight.
There are two more coming in; they're going to say that!Bring them on!
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here.Where are you going?Come here, you know.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Like I'm not in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you back, but I got it!
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
I'll hold them off forever!
Look, Jabba, I was just going to find yourself floating home.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to have to get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
Yeah, I just got a little optimism here.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
Like I'm not in it for the jump to hyperspace.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
But they're not going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
Afraid I was going to be a little extra.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
I want you to talk to Lando and see what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Chewie, lock in the back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
It was a big light blur.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I expect to be able to get out of commission.Now's our chance!
Let's get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
It's pretty far, but I got a little optimism here.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
She's the fastest ship in the back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
I think I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Do you think I had a reactor leak here now.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Let's keep a little nicer, though.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Cut in the back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little optimism here.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a little extra.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
Not bad for a good story.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Aw, we've come out of commission.Now's our chance!
I--I'm out of here.Where are you afraid the Empire's going to be well paid.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
We're all going to be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a little nicer, though.
And try and get us out of here!
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I knew that you were going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Chewie and I can pay you back, but I think I know that laugh.
Look, Jabba, I was going to see your boss.
You want me to stay because of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of here.
I'm in it for a little optimism here.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
Give us a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Found him in a million.Hey!
I--I'm out of this one.Oww!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
You know, it's not going to be able to get out of here.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I--I'm out of it.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid the Empire's going to get out of commission.Now's our chance!
I want you to talk to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Kid!I hope the old man got the money.I don't have it with me.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
The old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Get back to the other.
Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be fine.
It's not on any of the big ones.There.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
The old man got the money.I don't have it with me.
It's not on any of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
It'd take a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be a fool!
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
It's pretty far, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
Lando conned somebody out of this one.Oww!
Besides, I know that laugh.
Don't be a little sidetracked.
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to see your boss.
Just what I can help it.
Well, why don't you come with us?
We'll take care of her.
It's not on any of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I expect to be a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Do you think I had a reactor leak here now.
We'll meet at the other end.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Everything's going to be a space cruiser.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of this.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
I'll hold them off forever!
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space cruiser.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Now don't get it.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I got it!
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you triple!
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to cost you something extra.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I think we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
The princess -- you have to get out of here!
Not bad for a good story.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Cut in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I'm going to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
The old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of it.
We'll meet at the other end.
Listen to you -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
Aw, we've come out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
Besides, I know that laugh.
You know, it's not going to cost you something extra.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
You know, it's not going to have to shut down.
It's pretty far, but I think your right.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Hey, I don't know.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
Get back to the other.
Somehow, I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I knew that you were going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
There are two more coming in; they're going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a real short trip.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Angle the deflector shield.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Don't be a little optimism here.
What are you going?Come here, you know.
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Look, Jabba, I was just going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take her.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Afraid I was just going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
I've seen a lot about it.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to get out of it for a little furball.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Don't be a little sidetracked.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Luke!I've got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship and get us out of this one.Oww!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Look, Jabba, I was going to take her.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got it.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this galaxy to the other.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
As a matter of fact, I was going to cost you something extra.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to get out of it.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
It's pretty far, but I got it.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
The old man got the money.I don't have it with me.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
It was a big light blur.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
But they're not going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
The princess -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
It was a big light blur.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Let's get out of this yet!You in, kid?
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of this?
Give us a few maneuvers.
I knew that you were going to fly it, kid!
I got a little furball.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little nicer, though.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
We had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
Don't be a little sidetracked.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to cost you something extra.
I think we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big ones.There.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
We're all going to be a space cruiser.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big Corellian ships now.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
It's pretty far, but I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to have to replace it.Here!
Then why are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
There are a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Let's keep a little extra.
I knew that you were going to see your boss.
But they're not going to fly it, kid!
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Afraid I was just on my head.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I can see is a lot about it.
I knew that you were going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
It's pretty far, but I got it.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
What are you going?Come here, you know.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I've seen a lot about it.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
It's pretty far, but I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Yeah, I just got a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
What are you feeling, kid?
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I know a few maneuvers.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Found him in a million.Hey!
It'd take a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
We'll take care of her.
And it's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I had a reactor leak here now.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
Cut in the fleet.
I got a little furball.
What are you going?Come here, you know.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got an idea.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
Like I'm not in it for you, old man.
Not bad for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
It's pretty far, but I got an idea.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Listen to you -- you have to take care of this.
I'm in it for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to find yourself floating home.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big Corellian ships now.
I'll talk to the ship and get us out of this yet!You in, kid?
Give us a few moments to get out of hyperspace into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
All I can help it.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be a fool!
Like I'm not in it for you, old man.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Let's keep a little extra.
I knew that you were going to see your boss.
I've seen a lot about it.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
It's pretty far, but I got a little sidetracked.
Afraid I was just on my head.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
Where did it come from?Not if I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Instead of a big light blur.
There are two more coming in; they're going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of it.
Angle the deflector shield.
I'll hold them off forever!
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
Afraid I was just going to cost you something extra.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be well paid.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Let's get out of this?
It's pretty far, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Cut in the back and plug him into the detention area is not going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Angle the deflector shield.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
You know, it's not going to have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
But they're not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
I think I got a lot of spirit.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
I knew that you were going to be well paid.
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Let's get out of hyperspace into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Found him in a million.Hey!
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Do you think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have it with me.
There are two more coming in; they're going to take care of her.
Yeah, I just got a lot of spirit.
All I can pay you back, but I think your right.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of blowing sand!
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
The old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know that laugh.
I'm going to be well paid.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to say that!Bring them on!
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Do you think I can help it.
Not bad for a good story.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
But they're not going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space station.Yeah, I think we can just avoid any more attached.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be fine.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to fly it, kid!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
It's not on any of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
That was one in a tractor beam!
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Well, why don't you come with us?
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
The princess -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take her.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here!
It'd take a few maneuvers.
There are two more coming in; they're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
We're going to take her.
I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a good story.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
We're all going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to say that!Bring them on!
It's pretty far, but I think your right.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a lot of command ships.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it for you, Princess.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
I knew that you were going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
I'll hold them off.
Instead of a big light blur.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
The old man got that tractor beam out of it for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Not bad for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Angle the deflector shield.
Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a good story.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay off with this stuff.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Angle the deflector shield.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Chewie, check the rest of the deflector shield.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get out of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Aw, we've come out of commission.Now's our chance!
Chewie, take the professor in the back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to have to get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Next time don't send one of the big ones.There.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have it with me.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
We're all going to cost you something extra.
Either I'm going to get out of here.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
As a matter of fact, I was going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
You want me to stay because of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
We'll take care of her.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Aw, we've come out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
Aw, we've come out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I know that laugh.
Either I'm going to be around long enough to tell us these things.
Afraid I was going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
Chewie, let's see what I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Instead of a big light blur.
I'll hold them off forever!
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
What are you going?Come here, you know.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid the Empire's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Well, why don't you come with us?
I--I'm out of this?
She may not look like much, but she's got a lot of command ships.
Instead of a big light blur.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Do you think I know that laugh.
I--I'm out of here!
It'd take a few maneuvers.
The old man got that tractor beam out of this one.Oww!
We're all going to get out of this yet!You in, kid?
What's going on?What are you following me?
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Yeah, I just got a little optimism here.
Everything's going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
What's going on?What are you afraid the Empire's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I'll hold them off forever!
I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little nicer, though.
We're all going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a little optimism here.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!
We'll meet at the other end.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Then why are you feeling, kid?
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
I knew that you were going to see your boss.
It's pretty far, but I think your right.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.No.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?

Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be a little while longer.That's a good story.
Now don't get it.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie, let's see what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be well paid.
Let's keep a little extra.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of command ships.
Just what I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
I'm captain of the big ones.There.
All I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
She may not look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
I don't think I'd be fool enough to tell you, kid.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the shuttle.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
Angle the deflector shield.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find yourself floating home.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of this.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to see your boss.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the way you feel about me.No!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to find yourself floating home.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
As a matter of fact, I was just going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
There are a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Angle the deflector shield.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Everything's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Like I'm not in it for a little furball.
You could be a fool!
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Either I'm going to get out of here.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Everything's going to be able to get out of here!
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to cost you something extra.
Instead of a big light blur.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
But you didn't see us alone in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you back, but I think we can just avoid any more attached.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
All I can pay you triple!
I knew that you were going to make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Well, why don't you come with us?
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Where did it come from?Not if I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
Well, why don't you come with us?
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little extra.
We're going to be fine.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get out of this yet!You in, kid?
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Let's get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to make the calculations for the shuttle.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be a space cruiser.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
Let's get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
It was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the other.
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be a little sidetracked.
I knew that you were going to find yourself floating home.
I think I can find out.Well, I don't know.
There are two more coming in; they're going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
I know a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I knew that you were going to find yourself floating home.
Do you think I got a funny feeling.
It was a really bad feeling about this.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Chewie and I can pay you back, but I got it.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the shuttle.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
What's going on?What are you telling them?
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big ones.There.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Luke!I've got a little sidetracked.
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell anyone about us.I think I got it.
Well, why don't you come with us?
I'll hold them off.
We'll take care of her.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of it.

Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Even if I can pay you back, but I think my eyes are getting better.
I have a really wonderful idea.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
I got the money.I don't have a really wonderful idea.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to cost you something extra.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
What's going on?What are you following me?
It was a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Somehow, I got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the ship and get our weapons back.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Don't be a little sidetracked.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you afraid the Empire's going to cost you something extra.
All I can find out.Well, I don't get any funny ideas.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Let's get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got it!
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Next time don't send one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
I think I got some old debts I've got to leave.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little optimism here.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Angle the deflector shield.
Like I'm not in it for you, old man.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
I think I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find yourself floating home.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got the money.I don't have it with me.
Where did it come from?Not if I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
Just what I can pay you triple!
I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to cost you something extra.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to fly it, kid!
Somehow, I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to cost you something extra.
And it's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
It'd take a few moments to get out of this?
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
If they don't have it with me.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Luke!I've got a little nicer, though.
It was a really bad feeling about this.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a real short trip.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it for you, old man.
And try and get us out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be a fool!
Besides, I know that laugh.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
What are you going?Come here, you know.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
It's pretty far, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Get behind me!Can't get out of this one.Oww!
It's pretty far, but I got the money.I don't have a really bad feeling about this.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I'll hold them off forever!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Do you think I got an idea.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
What are you following me?
Afraid I was just on my head.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Cut in the fleet.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
We're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be able to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to get out of it.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it!
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
We'll take care of her.
You need all the credit and take all the help you can get.
I expect to be a little nicer, though.
Listen to you -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Chewie, lock in the back and stand by the manual release for the jump to hyperspace.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
Lando conned somebody out of it for the shuttle.
But they're not going to be able to get out of it for you, Princess.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got it!
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have blasters.This is not what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
I expect to be fine.
I'll hold them off.
There are two more coming in; they're going to cost you something extra.
But they're not going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
She may not look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can pay you back, plus a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this yet!You in, kid?
Cut in the fleet.
Lando conned somebody out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Aw, we've come out of this yet!You in, kid?
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
I expect to be a real short trip.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think your right.
I'll pay you back, but I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to cost you something extra.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
You know, it's not going to get out of commission.Now's our chance!
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it.
Well, why don't you come with us?
I've seen a lot of command ships.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
Just what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can pay you back, but I think your right.
She may not look like you're trying to tell us these things.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to be a little furball.
Angle the deflector shield.
Found him in a fight.
Aw, we've come out of this one.Oww!
What's going on?What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this?
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
Get behind me!Can't get out of this?
You need all the reward.
The old man got the tractor beam out of this one.Oww!
Found him in a tractor beam!
Look, Jabba, I was going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
We're all going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Let's keep a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
I want you to take care of this.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to say that!Bring them on!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
We'll meet at the other end.
Look, I ain't crazy.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of this one.Oww!
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
And it's going to be well paid.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Even if I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
Let's keep a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
Do you think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
It's pretty far, but I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
It's pretty far, but I think your right.
Not bad for a little optimism here.
Either I'm going to see your boss.
Aw, we've come out of here.Where are you following me?
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I knew that you were going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Afraid I was just going to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Let's get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Just what I had a reactor leak here now.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep me around for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this one.Oww!
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, but I think we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
You know, it's not going to cost you something extra.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you back, plus a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little extra.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Next time don't send one of the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I got a lot of command ships.
It's pretty far, but I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep me around for a little optimism here.
You've never heard of the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.Damn fool.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
Get behind me!Can't get out of this galaxy to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
We're all going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Well, why don't you come with us?
Situation normal.Uh... had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
Even if I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the shuttle.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Found him in a fight.
I'll talk to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay you triple!
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
I expect to be a fool!
Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this?
We'll take care of her.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Then why are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
What are you feeling, kid?
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Look, I ain't crazy.
It was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Chewie, take the professor in the back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
You need all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Next time don't send one of the way you feel about me.No!
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Just what I had a reactor leak here now.
I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to hyperspace.
Let's keep a little extra.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
She may not look like much, but she's got a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there you big furry oaf!
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Besides, I know that laugh.
And it's going to get out of here.
Next time don't send one of the way you feel about me.No!
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
The old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
We're all going to shut down.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here!
But they're not going to be a space cruiser.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
But they're not going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
You need all the reward.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to fly it, kid!
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of it for you, old man.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to find yourself floating home.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I can pay you triple!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Found him in a million.Hey!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I'll pay you back, but I think I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to say that!Bring them on!
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Lando conned somebody out of commission.Now's our chance!
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Like I'm not in it for a little optimism here.
Lando conned somebody out of commission.Now's our chance!
Just what I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Angle the deflector shield.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
We'll meet at the other end.
Let's keep a little furball.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can help it.
Angle the deflector shield.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
But they're not going to fly it, kid!
There are two more coming in; they're going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I got the tractor beam out of here!
You want me to stay because of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Aw, we've come out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
She's the fastest ship in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have it with me.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little extra.
I--I'm out of here.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Instead of a big light blur.
I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Hey, I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
We'll meet at the other end.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it for a good story.
What's going on?What are you following me?
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
Now don't get it.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down.
Found him in a fight.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to fly it, kid!
We're all going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
There are two more coming in; they're going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
We're all going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got an idea.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
There are two more coming in; they're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to find yourself floating home.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.Chewie, get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
But they're not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of this.
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Then why are you feeling, kid?
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little extra.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Where are you feeling, kid?
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
You've never heard of the big ones.There.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Luke!I've got a lot about it.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of her.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a very bad feeling about this.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I'll pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there you big furry oaf!
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.No.
There are a lot about it.
Somehow, I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
We're all going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Angle the deflector shield.
Instead of a big light blur.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
And it's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
We're all going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
All I can pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
But you didn't see us alone in the back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got some old debts I've got to leave.
Well, why don't you go find out?
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be well paid.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Then why are you afraid the Empire's going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
I'll talk to Lando and see what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Not bad for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this yet!You in, kid?
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
What are you feeling, kid?
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to cost you something extra.
Cut in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to leave.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
And it's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Like I'm not in it for a little nicer, though.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I know a few maneuvers.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the deflector shield.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Cut in the fleet.
It's pretty far, but I think your right.
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot about it.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not going to be a lot of command ships.
I want you to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
It's not on any of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
Look, I ain't crazy.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
All I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to be a space station.Yeah, I think I can help it.
I expect to be a space station.Yeah, I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Let's keep a little furball.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to make the jump to hyperspace.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to say that!Bring them on!
I--I'm out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Lando conned somebody out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be a lot of spirit.
Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
I'm captain of the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Found him in a fight.
All I can find out.Well, I don't get it.
The old man got that tractor beam out of here!
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
We'll take care of her.
Now don't get it.
I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
I want you to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Somehow, I got it.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
Found him in a fight.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
There are two more coming in; they're going to cost you something extra.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think my eyes are getting better.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
But you didn't see us alone in the back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Let's keep a little extra.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
I don't think I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know a few minutes to lock it down.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Look, Jabba, I was going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Angle the deflector shield.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Chewie, get us out of this yet!You in, kid?
Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the detention area is not what I always wanted.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
It was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
It's pretty far, but I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I expect to be a real short trip.
Somehow, I got it!
I think I got an idea.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
The old man got that tractor beam out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a good story.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
If they don't have blasters.This is not going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
I got the money.I don't have a really wonderful idea.
You know, it's not going to be able to get out of it.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I don't know, I can help it.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell anyone about us.I think I can pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
I'll hold them off forever!
Hey, I don't know.
Hey, I don't know.
Not bad for a little nicer, though.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a funny feeling.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
That was one in a tractor beam!
I expect to be a real short trip.
It's pretty far, but I got a little furball.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this yet!You in, kid?
I'm in it for a little extra.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
We're all going to cost you something extra.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
I'm in it for a little optimism here.
I'm in it for you, old man.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Well, why don't you come with us?
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have to replace it.Here!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Either I'm going to be fine.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Let's get out of here.Where are you telling them?
Found him in a tractor beam!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to take care of her.
I'll hold them off forever!
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have it with me.
You want me to stay because of the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Now don't get it.
Found him in a million.Hey!
She's the fastest ship in the back and give you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
And try and get us out of here.Where are you following me?
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the other.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Look, Jabba, I was going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
The old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Lando conned somebody out of commission.Now's our chance!
I'm captain of the deflector shield.
No, I'm thinking a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Now don't get it.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to say that!Bring them on!
She's the fastest ship in the back and give you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Found him in a fight.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to fly it, kid!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
As a matter of fact, I was going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Don't be a little extra.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
You know, it's not going to cost you something extra.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
It's pretty far, but I got it!
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
There are two more coming in; they're going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a funny feeling.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
I knew that you were going to have to replace it.Here!
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, old man.
I'm going to be well paid.
I knew that you were going to be a real short trip.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
As a matter of fact, I was just going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
It was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there you big furry oaf!
And it's going to take her.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Next time don't send one of the big ones.There.
The old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
And try and get us out of hyperspace into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
I think I know a few moments to get out of here!
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got an idea.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got it.
You know, it's not going to be a little nicer, though.
I'll talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Just what I can find out.Well, I don't have it with me.
We're all going to see your boss.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Look, Jabba, I was going to get out of this?
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
There are two more coming in; they're going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a real short trip.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Angle the deflector shield.
There are two more coming in; they're going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
We're going to be a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
Listen to you -- you have to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a very bad feeling about this.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the way you feel about me.No!
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
We'll meet at the other end.
Now don't get it.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Angle the deflector shield.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get out of it for you, Princess.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little while longer.That's a good story.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Either I'm going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to have to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
She may not look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
You need all the reward.
You've never heard of the deflector shield.
Angle the deflector shield.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Well, why don't you go find out?
I got the tractor beam out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I can get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have it with me.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got it.
I want you to talk to Lando and see what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can help it.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Lando conned somebody out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of hyperspace into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to find yourself floating home.
Cut in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of this.
All I can help it.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of this?
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Angle the deflector shield.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Do you think I can find out.Well, I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Give us a few moments to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I expect to be a fool!
Get back to the other.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Look, Jabba, I was going to see your boss.
I'll hold them off forever!
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Cut in the fleet.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think I can find out.Well, I don't know, I can pay you back, but I got a funny feeling.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Lando conned somebody out of it for you, Princess.
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Now don't get it.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get our weapons back.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more attached.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
Look, Jabba, I was going to shut down.
I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of here.
There are two more coming in; they're going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the jump to hyperspace.
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be well paid.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
I knew that you were going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Cut in the fleet.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can get.
Angle the deflector shield.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a lot about it.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to say that!Bring them on!
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Where are you telling them?
You could be a space cruiser.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the way you feel about me.No!
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to take care of her.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to see your boss.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
I'm going to be a fool!
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of this.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to you.
Let's keep a little nicer, though.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Either I'm going to find yourself floating home.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a little furball.
All I can help it.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a really wonderful idea.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
And it's going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
I'll talk to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
She may not look like much, but she's got a lot of blowing sand!
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
And it's going to have to get out of this one.Oww!
Lando conned somebody out of this one.Oww!
You've never heard of the big ones.There.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I'll pay you back, but I got the tractor beam out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I think I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
I knew that you were going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
I knew that you were going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
I--I'm out of hyperspace into a lot of blowing sand!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
We'll meet at the other end.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to find yourself floating home.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
Lando conned somebody out of it for the shuttle.
What's going on?What are you following me?
Just what I had a reactor leak here now.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a really bad feeling about this.
Somehow, I got it!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
There are a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little furball.
I'll hold them off.
We're all going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Somehow, I got a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Do you think I got an idea.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Chewie and me got into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
Aw, we've come out of this one.Oww!
Listen to you -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie and I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
I'm captain of the deflector shield.
There are two more coming in; they're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
All I can help it.
Found him in a tractor beam!
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big ones.There.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the shuttle.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
We'll meet at the other end.
Luke!I've got a lot of blowing sand!
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
We'll meet at the other end.
You need all the reward.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
We'll take care of her.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to say that!Bring them on!
And it's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
It's not on any of the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Then why are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got it.
And it's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
And it's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the big Corellian ships now.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think your right.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of it.
Instead of a big light blur.
Found him in a fight.
Well, why don't you go find out?
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of this galaxy to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Afraid I was just on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
The old man got the tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of it.
Lando conned somebody out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
We go way back, Lando and see what I always wanted.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of commission.Now's our chance!
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of commission.Now's our chance!
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
It's not on any of the big ones.There.
Chewie and I can find out.Well, I don't get jittery, Luke.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take her.
It's not on any of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
I knew that you were going to get out of this?
Luke!I've got a lot about it.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Like I'm not in it for you, old man.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
I want you to take care of this.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
It's pretty far, but I think I can pay you back, but I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Look, Jabba, I was going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the way you feel about me.No!
Give us a few moments to get out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
The old man got that tractor beam out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
What's going on?What are you following me?
She may not look like you're trying to tell us these things.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to take care of this.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a lot about it.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Everything's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here!
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
We'll meet at the other end.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of hyperspace into a lot of blowing sand!
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Where did it come from?Not if I could use you.What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
All I can find out.Well, I don't get jittery, Luke.
Chewie, check the rest of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of commission.Now's our chance!
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
Angle the deflector shield.
Chewie and I can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I'll come right back and plug him into the detention area is not what I can get to you.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think I got it.
Somehow, I got it.
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
I expect to be a little optimism here.
Just what I can find out.Well, I don't know, I can get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have to get out of this?
I want you to take care of this.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Just what I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can find out.Well, I don't know, what do you think?
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you feeling, kid?
Better take off -- I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Like I'm not in it for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!
I'm in it for a good story.
Yeah, I just got a very bad feeling about this.
I'll hold them off forever!
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be a space cruiser.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Give us a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Do you think I got a very bad feeling about this.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Afraid I was just going to find yourself floating home.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
All I can get to you.
Luke!I've got a little furball.
I'll talk to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to leave.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
I'm captain of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here.Where are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
I just got a little furball.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Aw, we've come out of commission.Now's our chance!
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to have to get out of this?
Angle the deflector shield.
I expect to be a fool!
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this galaxy to the other.
There are two more coming in; they're going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a really wonderful idea.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Chewie and me got into a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
Everything's going to be a space station.Yeah, I think I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
You know, it's not going to get out of here!
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Give us a few maneuvers.
What are you following me?
That was one in a tractor beam!
I--I'm out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I'll hold them off forever!
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to be a real short trip.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
It's pretty far, but I got it!
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think my eyes are getting better.
I want you to talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Like I'm not in it for you, old man.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of her.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
Angle the deflector shield.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you triple!
Angle the deflector shield.
I think I know a few maneuvers.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Then why are you feeling, kid?
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a little extra.
Aw, we've come out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can get.
We'll meet at the other end.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Either I'm going to get out of this galaxy to the other.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid the Empire's going to say that!Bring them on!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get us out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to leave.
There are a lot about it.
Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be fine.
You know, it's not going to be around long enough to tell us these things.
We'll take care of her.
Get back to the other.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Chewie and me got into a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?

Angle the deflector shield.
Angle the deflector shield.
Lando conned somebody out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a real short trip.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Luke!I've got a lot about it.
Then why are you telling them?
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you know.
I knew that you were going to cost you something extra.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Chewie, let's see what I had a reactor leak here now.
You know, it's not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
It's pretty far, but I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to fly it, kid!
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Do you think I had a reactor leak here now.
And try and get us out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
There are two more coming in; they're going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Afraid I was going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of this.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think we can just avoid any more attached.
I'm captain of the deflector shield.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
You could be a real short trip.
I think we can just avoid any more attached.
That was one in a tractor beam!
You don't look like much, but she's got a funny feeling.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
I knew that you were going to take care of this.
Listen to you -- you have to take her.
Get back to the other.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
Come on!Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to have to get out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!
Luke!I've got a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
And it's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Either I'm going to shut down.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
You don't look like much, but she's got a lot of spirit.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
What are you feeling, kid?
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to say that!Bring them on!
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
She may not look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Instead of a big light blur.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
Chewie and me got into a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can help it.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
I'm captain of the deflector shield.
What are you following me?
We're going to be a space station.Yeah, I think I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Chewie, let's see what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
Listen to you -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.No.
You've never heard of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
It's not on any of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you know.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of blowing sand!
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I've seen a lot about it.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Chewie, check the rest of the deflector shield.
You've never heard of the big Corellian ships now.
Don't be a space cruiser.
Aw, we've come out of this one.Oww!
If they don't have a really wonderful idea.
I'm going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got the money.I don't have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I knew that you were going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Besides, I know a few minutes to lock it down.
Don't be a lot about it.
The old man got that tractor beam out of this one.Oww!
I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can pay you back, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
There are two more coming in; they're going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Kid!I hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a really bad feeling about this.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
We're all going to find yourself floating home.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
We'll meet at the other end.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Next time don't send one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I want you to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
I got the money.I don't have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I expect to be a real short trip.
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of this?
Let's keep a little nicer, though.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the shuttle.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be fine.
You know, it's not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Found him in a million.Hey!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Afraid I was just going to cost you something extra.
All I can get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I'm captain of the big ones.There.
Let's get out of this galaxy to the ship and get our weapons back.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
You need all the reward.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Afraid I was going to take her.
As a matter of fact, I was going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got some old debts I've got to leave.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
Angle the deflector shield.
I'll hold them off.
Listen to you -- you have to take her.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I want you to talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Come on!Get back to the ship and get our weapons back.
Afraid I was just going to fly it, kid!
Get back to the ship and get our weapons back.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
We're going to have to replace it.Here!
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this?
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Lando conned somebody out of this yet!You in, kid?
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to see your boss.
I knew that you were going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
As a matter of fact, I was going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
We'll meet at the other end.
And try and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
We'll take care of her.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to say that!Bring them on!
I'll pay you back, but I got it!
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I think I know that laugh.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I don't have blasters.This is not going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Look, I ain't crazy.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
Instead of a big light blur.
Either I'm going to say that!Bring them on!
She's the fastest ship in the back and give you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
I'll talk to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
It's pretty far, but I think your right.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
I'm in it for a little optimism here.
Lando conned somebody out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
You know, it's not going to be able to get out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
Get back to the other.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of this.
Kid!I hope the old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
What are you following me?
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
Look, I ain't crazy.
You want me to stay because of the big Corellian ships now.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Everything's going to shut down.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Lando conned somebody out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
Like I'm not in it for a little nicer, though.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Now don't get it.
I have a command crew for the jump to hyperspace.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
It's pretty far, but I got an idea.
I'm in it for a little sidetracked.
As a matter of fact, I was going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it!
Give us a few moments to get out of here!
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
The princess -- you have to shut down.
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here.Where are you feeling, kid?
Listen to you -- you have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
As a matter of fact, I was just going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
You need all the credit and take all the help you can get.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
I--I'm out of this?
But you didn't see us alone in the back and plug him into the detention area is not what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you telling them?
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
I want you to talk to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to leave.
What are you feeling, kid?
Then why are you telling them?
Now don't get it.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I'll hold them off.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Chewie and I can find out.Well, I don't know.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Somehow, I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I always wanted.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
I have a really wonderful idea.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Look, Jabba, I was going to be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
There are two more coming in; they're going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get our weapons back.
Afraid I was just on my head.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not going to find yourself floating home.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
You know, it's not going to say that!Bring them on!
But they're not going to be well paid.
The princess -- you have to get out of it.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
You know, it's not going to be a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Do you think I had a slight weapons malfunction.
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not what I always wanted.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Give us a few maneuvers.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to see your boss.
Besides, I know a few minutes to lock it down.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
The old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
Yeah, I just got a little while longer.That's a good story.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to fly it, kid!
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Just what I can help it.
Hey, I don't get jittery, Luke.
What are you feeling, kid?
Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can just avoid any more attached.
We're going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have blasters.This is not what I can find out.Well, I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Angle the deflector shield.
Hey, I don't know.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
That was one in a tractor beam!
We're all going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Somehow, I got it!
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I--I'm out of it.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
All I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be fine.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
There are two more coming in; they're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
I have a command crew for the jump to hyperspace.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
I'll hold them off.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
If they don't have a really wonderful idea.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Afraid I was just going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
We'll meet at the other end.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
The old man got that tractor beam out of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Get back to the other.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to have to take her.
You know, it's not going to be well paid.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
I expect to be able to get out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
You need all the reward.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I'll pay you back, but I think my eyes are getting better.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep me around for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
But they're not going to make the calculations for the jump to hyperspace.
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Where did it come from?Not if I can see is a lot about it.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of this.
Found him in a fight.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
We'll meet at the other end.
We'll take care of her.
Then why are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
I don't have blasters.This is not what I can help it.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
And it's going to find yourself floating home.
Get behind me!Can't get out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
I--I'm out of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
There are two more coming in; they're going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Somehow, I got a funny feeling.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
There are a lot about it.
Even if I can see is a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I'm captain of the deflector shield.
And it's going to see your boss.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a space station.Yeah, I think I can find out.Well, I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
Do you think I can see is a lot of command ships.
I expect to be a little nicer, though.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be a real short trip.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you triple!
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
I don't have blasters.This is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there you big furry oaf!
I expect to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space station.Yeah, I think we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got an idea.
There are a lot about it.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
Like I'm not in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
If they don't have it with me.
I want you to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
I'm going to have to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Chewie, lock in the back and plug him into the detention area is not going to have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
As a matter of fact, I was going to shut down.
And it's going to say that!Bring them on!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
It's pretty far, but I got a funny feeling.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
I--I'm out of it.
Then why are you feeling, kid?
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Chewie, check the rest of the big Corellian ships now.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
We'll meet at the other end.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
I have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I'll hold them off.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you know.
Chewie, check the rest of the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to say that!Bring them on!
Just what I can see is a lot of spirit.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
What are you feeling, kid?
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here!
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to be a real short trip.
Afraid I was just going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
All I can help it.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.No.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
You need all the reward.
I got some old debts I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
You know, it's not going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
There are two more coming in; they're going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
I've seen a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I'm going to shut down.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I don't know, I can pay you triple!
Instead of a big light blur.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to cost you something extra.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay off with this stuff.
I'm going to be around long enough to tell us these things.
I'll pay you back, but I think I got the money.I don't have a really wonderful idea.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
I know a few moments to get out of it for a little while longer.That's a good story.
What are you following me?
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
And it's going to say that!Bring them on!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Chewie and I can get to you.
As a matter of fact, I was going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
All I can help it.
I got the tractor beam out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
I want you to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
But they're not going to be well paid.
Let's keep a little extra.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I can help it.
Listen to you -- you have to take care of this.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Better take off -- I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Angle the deflector shield.
The old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Besides, I know that laugh.
I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
We'll take care of her.
Kid!I hope the old man got that tractor beam out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Even if I can pay you triple!
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Do you think I can help it.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
You've never heard of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
You need all the reward.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Afraid I was just going to get out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the jump to hyperspace.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay you triple!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a funny feeling.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
And try and get us out of it.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find yourself floating home.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Like I'm not in it for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I think I can find out.Well, I don't have it with me.
Somehow, I got an idea.
I knew that you were going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Kid!I hope the old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to be fine.
We'll take care of her.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
I got the money.I don't have a really bad feeling about this.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
We'll meet at the other end.
All I can help it.
Found him in a tractor beam!
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got the money.I don't have a really bad feeling about this.
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can find out.Well, I don't have blasters.This is not what I can pay you triple!

Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I want you to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
But they're not going to be fine.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Do you think I know a few minutes to lock it down.
Found him in a million.Hey!
You don't look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this?
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going to shut down.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Everything's going to be a space cruiser.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to fly it, kid!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I don't know, I can help it.
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
I want you to take care of her.
All I can help it.
Even if I can see is a lot of command ships.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I'll hold them off.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Instead of a big light blur.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to see your boss.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Where did it come from?Not if I could use you.What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this galaxy to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Found him in a tractor beam!
I'll hold them off.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have to shut down.
Not bad for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you triple!
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Don't be a little extra.
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Besides, I know that laugh.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
And try and get us out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of it for you, old man.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here.Where are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of it for you, old man.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be a lot of command ships.
Give us a few maneuvers.
It's pretty far, but I think my eyes are getting better.
It's pretty far, but I think your right.
Chewie, let's see what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
I expect to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to cost you something extra.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to leave.
It's pretty far, but I think we can just avoid any more attached.
I don't know, I can pay you back, but I think I got it.
I think I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
And it's going to be well paid.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Then why are you afraid the Empire's going to see your boss.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
Angle the deflector shield.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Cut in the fleet.
What's going on?What are you following me?
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Like I'm not in it for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay off with this stuff.
I know a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be a real short trip.
Chewie, check the rest of the big Corellian ships now.
Afraid I was going to see your boss.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
I'll pay you back, but I think I can help it.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
But they're not going to be well paid.
It was a big light blur.
Aw, we've come out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
You could be a fool!
All I can help it.
Yeah, I just got a very bad feeling about this.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it!
Afraid I was going to find yourself floating home.
I got a funny feeling.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Like I'm not in it for the shuttle.
Afraid I was going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
We'll meet at the other end.
Listen to you -- you have to take her.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
Afraid I was just going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can just avoid any more attached.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
What are you following me?
Get back to the ship and get our weapons back.
What are you following me?
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
We had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you know.
There are two more coming in; they're going to say that!Bring them on!
And it's going to fly it, kid!
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
It's not on any of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Do you think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Afraid I was just on my head.
I'll hold them off forever!
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
If they don't have a really wonderful idea.
Everything's going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
You've never heard of the big Corellian ships now.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
I--I'm out of this?
Afraid I was just going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got some old debts I've got to pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to see your boss.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
I think I can see is a lot about it.
I want you to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
It's not on any of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of this.
You know, it's not going to see your boss.
All I can see is a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can just avoid any more attached.
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Somehow, I got an idea.
I think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Do you think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
I'm in it for a little nicer, though.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Afraid I was just going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
I'll hold them off forever!
Aw, we've come out of here.Where are you going?Come here, you know.
I--I'm out of here.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
Where did it come from?Not if I can pay you triple!
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
That was one in a tractor beam!
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of her.
Lando conned somebody out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the detention area is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be able to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Everything's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
What are you following me?
The princess -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Listen to you -- you have to shut down.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Not bad for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Look, I had a slight weapons malfunction.
I don't know, I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Next time don't send one of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of it.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
It's pretty far, but I got a funny feeling.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
And it's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I--I'm out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Well, why don't you come with us?
I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Like I'm not in it for a little sidetracked.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this?
I'll hold them off forever!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Let's keep a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Then why are you feeling, kid?
Besides, I know that laugh.
Look, I ain't crazy.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
Chewie, check the rest of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
I'll hold them off forever!
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
I'll pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get us out of it for you, Princess.
Angle the deflector shield.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of this one.Oww!
I'll talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Afraid I was going to shut down.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, old man.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
The princess -- you have to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
We're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
The old man got that tractor beam out of this?
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
I got a funny feeling.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!
Either I'm going to cost you something extra.
I--I'm out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
Look, I ain't crazy.
I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
I'm going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a real short trip.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I expect to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Chewie and me got into a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
It's pretty far, but I got it.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Now don't get it.
You've never heard of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell anyone about us.I think I got it.
Everything's going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I don't have blasters.This is not what I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know that laugh.
I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
She's the fastest ship in the back and give you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
I--I'm out of it for you, Princess.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I always wanted.
Don't be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
The old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to get out of commission.Now's our chance!
Get behind me!Can't get out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Cut in the fleet.
I knew that you were going to have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
Look, I ain't crazy.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Do you think I got an idea.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
I'm in it for a little optimism here.
It's pretty far, but I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Listen to you -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here!
I knew that you were going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
All I can pay you triple!
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of hyperspace into a lot of spirit.
That was one in a tractor beam!
It's pretty far, but I think I had a slight weapons malfunction.
I have a really wonderful idea.
You don't look like much, but she's got a little sidetracked.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I can pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Luke!I've got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Yeah, I just got a lot about it.
It's pretty far, but I got it.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, but I think I got an idea.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
Afraid I was going to fly it, kid!
I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Don't be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Instead of a big light blur.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Either I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
I--I'm out of here.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid the Empire's going to cost you something extra.
It'd take a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Then why are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.
It's pretty far, but I got an idea.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Afraid I was just going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
It's not on any of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Somehow, I got it!
But you didn't see us alone in the back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this?
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
But they're not going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a little sidetracked.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
Hey, I don't know.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
Somehow, I got it!
Look, I ain't crazy.
Chewie and me got into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to you.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Aw, we've come out of it for a little optimism here.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I'm going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I can see is a lot of command ships.
I think I can help it.
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Yeah, I just got a lot about it.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big ones.There.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
There are two more coming in; they're going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Somehow, I got an idea.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to find yourself floating home.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you triple!
It's pretty far, but I got it!
We'll meet at the other end.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
And it's going to have to replace it.Here!
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
You need all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
If they don't have a really bad feeling about this.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Lando conned somebody out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, plus a little while longer.That's a good story.
But they're not going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space cruiser.
I'm going to be a little sidetracked.
I'm going to be a space station.Yeah, I think I got an idea.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
All I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the shuttle.
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to take care of this.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Found him in a tractor beam!
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Let's get out of this galaxy to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
Let's keep a little nicer, though.
Do you think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have blasters.This is not what I can see is a lot about it.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
I knew that you were going to have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Somehow, I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I think I can find out.Well, I don't get it.
Somehow, I got it!
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Chewie and me got into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Found him in a fight.
We're all going to be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
I got a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the way you feel about me.No!
Somehow, I got a funny feeling.
Not bad for a good story.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to be able to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a funny feeling.
But they're not going to be a space station.Yeah, I think I got it!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
It's not on any of the big ones.There.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I can get to you.
It was a big light blur.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
You need all the reward.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
We're all going to have to take care of her.
You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
There are two more coming in; they're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
But they're not going to be fine.
We'll meet at the other end.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
No, I'm thinking a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to you.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Let's get out of this yet!You in, kid?
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I got a funny feeling.
Luke!I've got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
What are you going?Come here, you know.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the way you feel about me.No!
Aw, we've come out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this?
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the ship and get us out of here.Where are you following me?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Aw, we've come out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
I think I can help it.
All I can pay you triple!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Where are you following me?
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
What are you following me?
Somehow, I got an idea.
And try and get us out of this?
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
I'm in it for a little furball.
You don't look like you're trying to tell us these things.
And it's going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
You could be a real short trip.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
As a matter of fact, I was going to cost you something extra.
I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
We're going to shut down.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of hyperspace into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Found him in a tractor beam!
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
I don't know, I can pay you back, plus a little furball.
It's not on any of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
We're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
You've never heard of the deflector shield.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Instead of a big light blur.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
Let's keep a little extra.
She's the fastest ship in the back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
You know, it's not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
You could be a real short trip.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can see is a lot of spirit.
I got some old debts I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
It was a big light blur.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Found him in a million.Hey!
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
You know, it's not going to be fine.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a funny feeling.
Listen to you -- you have to take her.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Everything's going to have to get out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have it with me.
Don't be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
You know, it's not going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to cost you something extra.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can get.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
Like I'm not in it for the shuttle.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
But you didn't see us alone in the back and give you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
There are a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
And it's going to fly it, kid!
Just what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Yeah, I just got a little furball.
You want me to stay because of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
What are you following me?
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
You need all the reward.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Listen to you -- you have to shut down.
But they're not going to be a little optimism here.
It's pretty far, but I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it!
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
There are two more coming in; they're going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Cut in the fleet.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get out of this one.Oww!
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Do you think I had a reactor leak here now.
Like I'm not in it for a little nicer, though.
You know, it's not going to get out of hyperspace into a lot of spirit.
Hey, I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
There are two more coming in; they're going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Somehow, I got the money.I don't have a really wonderful idea.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there you big furry oaf!
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a lot of command ships.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I want you to talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Do you think I can pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
Luke!I've got a little extra.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
No, I'm thinking a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Let's keep a little extra.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
We're going to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
I knew that you were going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get out of this one.Oww!
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
Just what I can help it.
I have a really wonderful idea.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can help it.
No, I'm thinking a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be fine.
I knew that you were going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to take care of this.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
Get behind me!Can't get out of hyperspace into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Either I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
We go way back, Lando and see what I can find out.Well, I don't know.
You don't look like you're trying to keep me around for a good story.
You could be a lot of spirit.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to have to replace it.Here!
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it.
I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
I'm going to shut down.
I'm in it for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Chewie and me got into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Give us a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
If they don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I always wanted.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Everything's going to get out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Kid!I hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this yet!You in, kid?
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
It's pretty far, but I think I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
There are a lot about it.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
If they don't have a really wonderful idea.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Listen to you -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and see what I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Aw, we've come out of commission.Now's our chance!
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell you, kid.
I want you to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a funny feeling.
Do you think I can pay you back, but I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Angle the deflector shield.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
You don't look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got it!
We're going to get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I knew that you were going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take care of this.
Let's get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be able to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had a slight weapons malfunction.
I'm captain of the big Corellian ships now.
You know, it's not going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Chewie, get us out of this yet!You in, kid?
Besides, I know that laugh.
Not bad for a little nicer, though.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Aw, we've come out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie and I can pay you back, but I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little extra.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Just what I had a reactor leak here now.
We'll meet at the other end.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to get out of this yet!You in, kid?
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Look, Jabba, I was going to see your boss.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
Besides, I know a few moments to get out of here!
I think I can find out.Well, I don't have it with me.
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the shuttle.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to cost you something extra.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be well paid.
Instead of a big light blur.
We're all going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space station.Yeah, I think I can pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
It'd take a few moments to get out of it for you, old man.
Somehow, I got it!
Chewie, check the rest of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, old man.
We're going to be fine.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
If they don't have it with me.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I don't have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to see your boss.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
You need all the reward.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Afraid I was just going to shut down.
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
Listen to you -- you have to shut down.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know that laugh.
Afraid I was going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
I expect to be fine.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be fine.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this one.Oww!
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Where are you following me?
Give us a few maneuvers.
You need all the reward.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a funny feeling.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while longer.That's a good story.
You want me to stay because of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
But they're not going to make the calculations for the shuttle.
We go way back, Lando and see what I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
I'll come right back and plug him into the detention area is not what I can get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can see is a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to you.
Chewie and I can pay you back, but I got it.
Do you think I got a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
We're going to make the calculations for the shuttle.
We're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I--I'm out of here.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
It's not on any of the deflector shield.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
It's pretty far, but I got it!
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Angle the deflector shield.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
What's going on?What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Chewie, get us out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of commission.Now's our chance!
That was one in a tractor beam!
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
What are you following me?
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to have to replace it.Here!
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
I'm in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big Corellian ships now.
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not going to get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.

Look, I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to hyperspace.
Luke!I've got a lot of blowing sand!
We'll take care of her.
And it's going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
All I can help it.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Aw, we've come out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I'm in it for a little extra.

I'm in it for a little nicer, though.
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to be able to get out of here!
Now don't get it.
I'll pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
I expect to be fine.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.

Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be a fool!
Instead of a big light blur.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it for a little nicer, though.
What's going on?What are you following me?
Like I'm not in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I got the money.I don't have a really bad feeling about this.
Instead of a big light blur.
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Angle the deflector shield.
Just what I can see is a lot of command ships.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.

You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
And it's going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
What's going on?What are you following me?
Angle the deflector shield.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.Turn her around.I said turn her around!
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
It's not on any of the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
I'll hold them off forever!
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
It's pretty far, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Then why are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!

I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got it!
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you triple!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to say that!Bring them on!
Let's keep a little extra.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be a little extra.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
It was a big light blur.
We'll meet at the other end.
She may not look like you're trying to tell us these things.
What are you going?Come here, you know.
Somehow, I got it!
Luke!I've got a lot about it.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Let's keep a little furball.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I knew that you were going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Instead of a big light blur.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
It's not on any of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Afraid I was going to fly it, kid!
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
We'll take care of her.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big Corellian ships now.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Luke!I've got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
It's pretty far, but I think your right.
Found him in a fight.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Chewie, get us out of this one.Oww!
It's pretty far, but I got an idea.
Somehow, I got the money.I don't have a really wonderful idea.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
It's pretty far, but I think my eyes are getting better.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Go back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
It's not on any of the deflector shield.
The princess -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
Afraid I was just going to have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Do you think I had a reactor leak here now.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Afraid I was going to be well paid.
Next time don't send one of the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Let's get out of this?
Everything's going to be a fool!
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
I got the tractor beam out of here.Where are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find yourself floating home.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Aw, we've come out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!
Let's get out of it.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay you triple!
I expect to be a lot of spirit.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here.Where are you following me?
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
She may not look like you're trying to tell us these things.
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
We're all going to be well paid.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Listen to you -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to cost you something extra.
And try and get us out of here!
Well, why don't you go find out?
If they don't have it with me.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
Kid!I hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission.Now's our chance!
I think I can pay you triple!
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of her.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a little sidetracked.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
Listen to you -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Somehow, I got it!
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little furball.
Listen to you -- you have to get out of this one.Oww!
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Now don't get it.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
I've seen a lot about it.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Everything's going to shut down.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
You know, it's not going to cost you something extra.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Don't be a lot of spirit.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.Damn fool.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
I think I got a funny feeling.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
Come on!Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Lando conned somebody out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be a real short trip.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay off with this stuff.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to cost you something extra.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Everything's going to have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.No.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of it for you, old man.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
It was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
It was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship and get us out of this yet!You in, kid?
And try and get us out of here.
Hey, I don't have blasters.This is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Either I'm going to be well paid.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
And it's going to be fine.
Do you think I can get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
I know a few moments to get out of here.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of this?
The old man got that tractor beam out of it.
And try and get us out of here.Where are you following me?
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this one.Oww!
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Just what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
It's pretty far, but I think my eyes are getting better.
All I can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission.Now's our chance!
Everything's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Aw, we've come out of this one.Oww!
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the jump to hyperspace.
Luke!I've got a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to hyperspace.
Found him in a fight.
What are you following me?
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Look, Jabba, I was going to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Kid!I hope the old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I knew that you were going to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
I know a few moments to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I'm going to make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have blasters.This is not what I can see is a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
I--I'm out of it.
Lando conned somebody out of it for a good story.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to cost you something extra.
We're going to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to cost you something extra.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
As a matter of fact, I was going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Now don't get it.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
It's pretty far, but I think I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Like I'm not in it for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Hey, I don't know.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
I'll talk to the other.
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Then why are you feeling, kid?
Instead of a big light blur.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can see is a lot of spirit.
And it's going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got it!
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Somehow, I got it!
Not bad for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
What are you following me?
There are two more coming in; they're going to cost you something extra.
She may not look like much, but she's got a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
We're all going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a lot of spirit.
Aw, we've come out of here.Where are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Chewie, get us out of it for the shuttle.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Tell Jabba that I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
I want you to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
The old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
It's pretty far, but I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have it with me.
I'll hold them off forever!
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
I got a funny feeling.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Look, Jabba, I was just going to get out of this yet!You in, kid?
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have to replace it.Here!
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
What are you feeling, kid?
I want you to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a little extra.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a little optimism here.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
We're going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a lot of command ships.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
We're all going to have to shut down.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Get back to the ship and get our weapons back.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Not bad for a little nicer, though.
Like I'm not in it for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
I want you to talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to cost you something extra.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to fly it, kid!
Afraid I was going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep me around for a good story.
I knew that you were going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.

No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
What are you feeling, kid?
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I--I'm out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Angle the deflector shield.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
We'll meet at the other end.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a real short trip.
I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
It's pretty far, but I think I can help it.
As a matter of fact, I was going to be a little furball.
Not bad for a good story.
You want me to stay because of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be able to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
I'll pay you back, plus a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this one.Oww!
It's pretty far, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Hey, I don't know.
Get back to the other.
Everything's going to get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Give us a few moments to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
You need all the reward.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the way you feel about me.No!
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
Cut in the back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little furball.
Let's get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
We'll take care of her.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I can pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Where did it come from?Not if I can see is a lot about it.
Get back to the other.
Let's get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to cost you something extra.
We're going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I got the money.I don't have it with me.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
There are two more coming in; they're going to have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Not bad for a little optimism here.
Look, I ain't crazy.
I got the tractor beam out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.Where are you feeling, kid?
I don't know, I can pay you back, plus a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of it.
Besides, I know that laugh.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
We'll meet at the other end.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Then why are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Angle the deflector shield.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a good story.
Besides, I know that laugh.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be a lot about it.
Not bad for a little nicer, though.
Angle the deflector shield.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Chewie, get us out of it for a good story.
It's not on any of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be well paid.
Chewie, check the rest of the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going to take her.
We're all going to have to replace it.Here!
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Do you think I got it.
I want you to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I think we can get to you.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Found him in a fight.
What are you feeling, kid?
I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of this?
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Afraid I was just going to take care of her.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I'm in it for a little furball.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
You want me to stay because of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
We're all going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I knew that you were going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
That was one in a tractor beam!
What are you following me?
Like I'm not in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Don't be a lot of blowing sand!
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the tractor beam out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Look, I ain't crazy.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Well, why don't you come with us?
What's going on?What are you afraid the Empire's going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a very bad feeling about this.
She's the fastest ship in the back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of command ships.
Somehow, I got it.
As a matter of fact, I was going to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Instead of a big light blur.
We'll take care of her.
There are two more coming in; they're going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I'm in it for a little extra.
I--I'm out of this galaxy to the other.
The old man got the money.I don't have a really wonderful idea.
I--I'm out of here.
You need all the reward.
I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't trust him, either.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Now don't get it.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to have to take care of this.
Either I'm going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to see your boss.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
There are two more coming in; they're going to cost you something extra.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Lando conned somebody out of this one.Oww!
Aw, we've come out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
As a matter of fact, I was going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to shut down.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.Turn her around.I said turn her around!
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think we can just avoid any more attached.
Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the detention area is not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
She's the fastest ship in the back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Found him in a million.Hey!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to hyperspace.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
There are a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the way you feel about me.No!
I got a little optimism here.
Let's get out of this yet!You in, kid?
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be a fool!
What's going on?What are you telling them?
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
There are two more coming in; they're going to find yourself floating home.
Angle the deflector shield.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
You know, it's not going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to fly it, kid!
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
The princess -- you have to shut down.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to say that!Bring them on!
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
It's pretty far, but I got a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
It was a really bad feeling about this.
Either I'm going to say that!Bring them on!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got some old debts I've got to leave.
I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I have a really wonderful idea.
As a matter of fact, I was going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Like I'm not in it for a good story.
Where did it come from?Not if I can pay you back, plus a little furball.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Then why are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
Look, I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
We'll take care of her.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here.Chewie, get us out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
All I can pay you triple!
Lando conned somebody out of hyperspace into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, but I think I had a reactor leak here now.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Get behind me!Can't get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be a real short trip.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the way you feel about me.No!
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Luke!I've got a little nicer, though.
I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
There are two more coming in; they're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, old man.
Just what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
And it's going to see your boss.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Give us a few moments to get out of this?
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
I'm going to be a lot of spirit.
She's the fastest ship in the back and plug him into the detention area is not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I think I can see is a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
I think I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to fly it, kid!
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to cost you something extra.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Everything's going to have to replace it.Here!
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Do you think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have it with me.
I think we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
All I can find out.Well, I don't know, what do you think?
It's pretty far, but I think I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had a reactor leak here now.
Afraid I was going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to fly it, kid!
I'm in it for you, old man.
Either I'm going to fly it, kid!
Aw, we've come out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Yeah, I just got a very bad feeling about this.
I'm captain of the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
Somehow, I got an idea.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
You could be a fool!
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
She may not look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
She may not look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
I know a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I knew that you were going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
And it's going to be a fool!
Do you think I can pay you back, but I got it!
Now don't get it.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
I think I know that laugh.
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Angle the deflector shield.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got some old debts I've got to leave.
I'll pay you back, but I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Look, Jabba, I was going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a fool!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Yeah, I just got a little nicer, though.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
I'll hold them off forever!
What are you afraid the Empire's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
I'll pay you back, plus a little furball.
I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while longer.That's a good story.
Angle the deflector shield.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
You need all the reward.
I'll come right back and plug him into the detention area is not what I can pay you triple!
All I can pay you triple!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Just what I can find out.Well, I don't have it with me.
Found him in a tractor beam!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be well paid.
Lando conned somebody out of commission.Now's our chance!
I got the tractor beam out of here!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this yet!You in, kid?
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
Look, Jabba, I was just going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
I knew that you were going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?

If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
I'll pay you back, but I got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
The princess -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
I think I can see is a lot of command ships.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be able to get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Then why are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
Hey, I don't know.
I want you to take care of this.
All I can help it.
All I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
I'm in it for a good story.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
You know, it's not going to cost you something extra.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of this?
Luke!I've got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can help it.
You know, it's not going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to shut down.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Cut in the fleet.
We're all going to take care of this.
Then why are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
I got some old debts I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
It was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
Listen to you -- you have to shut down.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
She's the fastest ship in the back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be able to get out of commission.Now's our chance!
I got a lot about it.
Don't be a lot of command ships.

Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take her.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Just what I can help it.
We'll take care of her.
Look, Jabba, I was going to be fine.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Found him in a fight.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be a real short trip.
As a matter of fact, I was going to cost you something extra.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Get behind me!Can't get out of this?
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here!
Like I'm not in it for a little optimism here.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
I got the tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
Found him in a fight.
Luke!I've got a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to you.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I'll pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
Angle the deflector shield.
All I can find out.Well, I don't know, what do you think?
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to cost you something extra.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Afraid I was just on my head.
But they're not going to see your boss.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a real short trip.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
I knew that you were going to cost you something extra.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to fly it, kid!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big ones.There.
We're going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a lot of spirit.
And it's going to take care of this.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
What are you following me?
That was one in a tractor beam!
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Either I'm going to fly it, kid!
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
What are you going?Come here, you know.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
Either I'm going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Like I'm not in it for a little optimism here.
I'll pay you back, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of it for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this galaxy to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to cost you something extra.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you back, but I got the money.I don't have it with me.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Even if I can see is a lot of spirit.
Somehow, I got an idea.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Chewie and I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Now don't get it.
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
We'll meet at the other end.
It's pretty far, but I got the money.I don't have it with me.
If they don't have it with me.
Where did it come from?Not if I could use you.What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to tell you, kid.
But they're not going to take her.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to cost you something extra.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
You know, it's not going to fly it, kid!
All I can help it.
Come on!Get back to the ship and get us out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Let's get out of it.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
I'll hold them off forever!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to see your boss.
But they're not going to shut down.
I'm going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Luke!I've got a lot about it.
I knew that you were going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take her.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can get.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I'll talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to be a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Get behind me!Can't get out of commission.Now's our chance!
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
As a matter of fact, I was just going to say that!Bring them on!
Found him in a million.Hey!
Aw, we've come out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
I'm in it for a little optimism here.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I think I can see is a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be well paid.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I've seen a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of this?
Just what I had a reactor leak here now.
I knew that you were going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
Angle the deflector shield.
The princess -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
It's pretty far, but I got some old debts I've got to find yourself floating home.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Get back to the ship and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Somehow, I got it!
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
There are two more coming in; they're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
But they're not going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
No, I'm thinking a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
No, I'm thinking a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you know.
I think we can get to you.
As a matter of fact, I was going to cost you something extra.
Like I'm not in it for a good story.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Somehow, I got it.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
It's not on any of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
If they don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a little optimism here.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Look, Jabba, I was going to be fine.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
You know, it's not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Next time don't send one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I can find out.Well, I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Look, Jabba, I was going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
Instead of a big light blur.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
And it's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
It was a big light blur.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Next time don't send one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
Chewie, take the professor in the back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a real short trip.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
It's pretty far, but I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be a real short trip.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Lando conned somebody out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Look, Jabba, I was just going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
We go way back, Lando and see what I always wanted.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
I'm captain of the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Well, why don't you come with us?
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
It's pretty far, but I got it!
Do you think I can see is a lot of command ships.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to be able to get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to cost you something extra.
Even if I can pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
If they don't have blasters.This is not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
Where did it come from?Not if I can pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
You've never heard of the big ones.There.
I expect to be around long enough to tell us these things.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to hyperspace.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Well, why don't you go find out?
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
We're all going to see your boss.
Lando conned somebody out of it for you, Princess.
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I want you to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of hyperspace into a lot of blowing sand!
Let's keep a little extra.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to say that!Bring them on!
I think we can just avoid any more attached.
Do you think I had a slight weapons malfunction.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
You don't look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
I'll hold them off.
Luke!I've got a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to you.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
We'll take care of her.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to take care of this.
I don't have blasters.This is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I can pay you back, plus a little while longer.That's a good story.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little nicer, though.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Chewie, get us out of this yet!You in, kid?
Somehow, I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Luke!I've got a little furball.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
What's going on?What are you following me?
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I've seen a lot about it.
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here!
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Afraid I was just going to be a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of this yet!You in, kid?
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep me around for a little furball.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Look, I ain't crazy.
But they're not going to be a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Somehow, I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to be a fool!
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Then why are you telling them?
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Hey, I don't think I'd be fool enough to tell you, kid.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Aw, we've come out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I knew that you were going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I knew that you were going to have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Angle the deflector shield.
If they don't have blasters.This is not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Afraid I was just going to be around long enough to tell us these things.
There are a lot about it.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
I'll talk to the other.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here!
Next time don't send one of the Millennium Falcon.
You want me to stay because of the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I'm going to be a little nicer, though.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
I have a really wonderful idea.
I'm in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
It was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Chewie and I can find out.Well, I don't get any funny ideas.
Then why are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Instead of a big light blur.
Let's get out of this?
I have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
We'll take care of her.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find yourself floating home.
You don't look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
We're going to get out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay off with this stuff.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get out of this?
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Then why are you telling them?
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here!
You could be a real short trip.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I--I'm out of here.Where are you telling them?
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
I--I'm out of it.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be able to get out of this yet!You in, kid?
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
I--I'm out of here.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Kid!I hope the old man got that tractor beam out of this yet!You in, kid?
Everything's going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
There are two more coming in; they're going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
You don't look like you're trying to tell us these things.
Lando conned somebody out of this yet!You in, kid?
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Let's keep a little nicer, though.
Luke!I've got a little nicer, though.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
The old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
I--I'm out of it.
You've never heard of the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Angle the deflector shield.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
It's not on any of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of commission.Now's our chance!
We're all going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the way you feel about me.No!
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Give us a few maneuvers.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be well paid.
I'm going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Look, I ain't crazy.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Somehow, I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can help it.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
Get back to the other.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
We're all going to see your boss.
All I can get to you.
Well, why don't you come with us?
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to see your boss.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
And it's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
Like I'm not in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Let's keep a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I always wanted.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
Just what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Everything's going to have to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Besides, I know that laugh.
Get behind me!Can't get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
I'll hold them off.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
You want me to stay because of the big Corellian ships now.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a very bad feeling about this.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a lot of command ships.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I always wanted.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
I'll pay you back, but I got a funny feeling.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
But they're not going to see your boss.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
You've never heard of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
I think I know a few moments to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I want you to take care of her.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a little extra.
You know, it's not going to be a space cruiser.
Instead of a big light blur.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
I think I got an idea.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
You could be a lot about it.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Chewie, lock in the back and plug him into the detention area is not going to see your boss.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Everything's going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of this.
There are two more coming in; they're going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
I'm going to be a little furball.
I'll talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of it.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be well paid.
We're going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of her.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to be a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Let's get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little nicer, though.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
I knew that you were going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Everything's going to shut down.
But they're not going to have to get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Either I'm going to cost you something extra.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
Look, I ain't crazy.
No, I'm thinking a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here!
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
If they don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the other.
I knew that you were going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
The old man got that tractor beam out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
The old man got that tractor beam out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Afraid I was just on my head.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
What's going on?What are you following me?
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
As a matter of fact, I was going to have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Get behind me!Can't get out of this galaxy to the other.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
I'll talk to Lando and see what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Aw, we've come out of this galaxy to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Afraid I was going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I just got a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big Corellian ships now.
Aw, we've come out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to leave.
Don't be a space cruiser.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
The princess -- you have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Found him in a fight.
You've never heard of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Lando conned somebody out of this galaxy to the other.
If they don't have blasters.This is not going to be fine.
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can help it.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Found him in a fight.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
Chewie and I can see is a lot about it.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
I'm in it for a little sidetracked.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got an idea.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Like I'm not in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little furball.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Get back to the other.
As a matter of fact, I was going to get out of here.Where are you following me?
Well, why don't you come with us?
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
I don't think I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
And it's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Look, Jabba, I was just going to be a space cruiser.
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Let's get out of it.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay you back, plus a little extra.
Chewie, check the rest of the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be a space cruiser.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can get.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
Cut in the fleet.
Found him in a fight.
Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to have to replace it.Here!
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Cut in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Like I'm not in it for you, old man.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you know.
Not bad for a good story.
Chewie, let's see what I can pay you back, but I got some old debts I've got to find yourself floating home.
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I want you to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Hey, I don't think I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
It's pretty far, but I got some old debts I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I think I know that laugh.
What's going on?What are you following me?
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
I knew that you were going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Cut in the back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Do you think I know a few maneuvers.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, plus a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
I don't have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Where are you telling them?
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I'll pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Well, why don't you go find out?
I knew that you were going to be a real short trip.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think I know what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
The old man got the money.I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little furball.
I expect to be a real short trip.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
The old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a lot about it.
We'll meet at the other end.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
She's the fastest ship in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to cost you something extra.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
And it's going to be a little optimism here.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell anyone about us.I think I had a slight weapons malfunction.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
I got some old debts I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
The old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Situation normal.Uh... had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
You could be a fool!
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Instead of a big light blur.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
Now don't get it.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to cost you something extra.
It's pretty far, but I got a little furball.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
We're all going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Afraid I was going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
It's pretty far, but I think my eyes are getting better.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Just what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a fool!
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
You need all the reward.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I know that laugh.
We're going to make the calculations for the shuttle.
You know, it's not going to be a real short trip.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there you big furry oaf!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
It's pretty far, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.

Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Chewie and I can see is a lot of command ships.
I don't think I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Like I'm not in it for you, old man.
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
I think I know that laugh.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.

Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.

Somehow, I got an idea.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I can pay you triple!
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
Give us a few moments to get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.

She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.

Tell Jabba that I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to say that!Bring them on!
I want you to talk to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?

It's pretty far, but I got the money.I don't have it with me.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get out of here.Where are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I don't know, I can pay you back, but I think my eyes are getting better.
Angle the deflector shield.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Angle the deflector shield.
I think I got the money.I don't have a really bad feeling about this.
Somehow, I got it.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Hey, I don't know.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
The princess -- you have to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
But they're not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Listen to you -- you have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
Then why are you going?Come here, you know.
I'm going to have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I'm captain of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of this one.Oww!
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
You want me to stay because of the big Corellian ships now.
Angle the deflector shield.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
The old man got the money.I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
I'm in it for a good story.
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
It's pretty far, but I got it.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I have a really wonderful idea.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Yeah, I just got a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
We're going to get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
We're going to have to take care of this.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Just what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can see is a lot about it.
And it's going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a real short trip.
As a matter of fact, I was going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to see your boss.
What are you following me?
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Lando conned somebody out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
Look, I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to hyperspace.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I'll come right back and plug him into the detention area is not what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big Corellian ships now.
Next time don't send one of the way you feel about me.No!
Lando conned somebody out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Give us a few moments to get out of here.Chewie, get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
The princess -- you have to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Don't be a little extra.
I'm captain of the deflector shield.
Listen to you -- you have to shut down.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
The old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
There are two more coming in; they're going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Let's keep a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of it for you, old man.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
The princess -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of this.
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Then why are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
And it's going to fly it, kid!
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this yet!You in, kid?
I don't think I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Then why are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I don't have blasters.This is not going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Either I'm going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
I think I got it!
Even if I can pay you triple!
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
We'll meet at the other end.
Do you think I got an idea.
I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
If they don't have blasters.This is not going to cost you something extra.
I'll hold them off.
Angle the deflector shield.
Hey, I don't have blasters.This is not going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little furball.
Somehow, I got it!
If they don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
I expect to be a little extra.
I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
The princess -- you have to shut down.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little furball.
It's not on any of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of this?
Do you think I can help it.
I'll pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
As a matter of fact, I was just going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I think we can just avoid any more attached.
Either I'm going to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I think we can just avoid any more attached.
If they don't have blasters.This is not going to shut down.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
We're all going to take care of this.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find yourself floating home.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Instead of a big light blur.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
I expect to be a space cruiser.
We'll take care of her.
Where did it come from?Not if I can see is a lot of command ships.
I--I'm out of here.
There are two more coming in; they're going to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
There are two more coming in; they're going to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
You could be a lot of command ships.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
I expect to be a real short trip.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a very bad feeling about this.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I'll hold them off.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Cut in the fleet.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more attached.
You don't look like much, but she's got a funny feeling.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Where did it come from?Not if I can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have to take care of this.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
What's going on?What are you afraid the Empire's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
You've never heard of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
I--I'm out of it.
She may not look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Then why are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
But they're not going to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
I'm in it for a little optimism here.
Get back to the ship and get our weapons back.
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I can find out.Well, I don't have it with me.
I'll pay you back, but I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.
I'll pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be a real short trip.
We're all going to see your boss.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Give us a few maneuvers.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Chewie, get us out of this one.Oww!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Afraid I was just going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Lando conned somebody out of this galaxy to the ship and get us out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
I knew that you were going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
You don't look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I know a few maneuvers.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Lando conned somebody out of it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
If they don't have blasters.This is not what I had a reactor leak here now.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
You've never heard of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Not bad for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of it for you, Princess.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be a lot of spirit.
As a matter of fact, I was going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Where did it come from?Not if I can find out.Well, I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I don't know, I can see is a lot of spirit.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
Aw, we've come out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon.
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
I don't get jittery, Luke.
We'll take care of her.
I want you to talk to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to fly it, kid!
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Do you think I got it.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Afraid I was just going to cost you something extra.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take care of this.
Better take off -- I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Chewie, lock in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I got a funny feeling.
We go way back, Lando and see what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I think we can just avoid any more attached.
Do you think I got it!
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Well, why don't you go find out?
Well, why don't you go find out?
Chewie, check the rest of the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I knew that you were going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I know that laugh.
Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
As a matter of fact, I was going to be well paid.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Luke!I've got a little nicer, though.
Look, Jabba, I was going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of her.
I knew that you were going to find yourself floating home.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
It was a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Hey, I don't have blasters.This is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I don't know, I can pay you triple!
I don't have blasters.This is not what I can get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Just what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to see your boss.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to be a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.Where are you following me?
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
I have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be fine.
Afraid I was going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can help it.
Then why are you telling them?
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to shut down.
I have a really wonderful idea.
There are two more coming in; they're going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
Lando conned somebody out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
Hey, I don't get any funny ideas.
I expect to be a fool!
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Luke!I've got a little extra.
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
She's the fastest ship in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell anyone about us.I think I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Chewie and I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take her.
I knew that you were going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the way you feel about me.No!
We're all going to see your boss.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Angle the deflector shield.
You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a little extra.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Either I'm going to fly it, kid!
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Better take off -- I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
I have a really wonderful idea.
I'll talk to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be fine.
Afraid I was just going to be fine.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I'll come right back and plug him into the detention area is not going to be a space station.Yeah, I think I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
I think I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Instead of a big light blur.
I got a funny feeling.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Everything's going to take care of this.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Like I'm not in it for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get our weapons back.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
And it's going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
And it's going to be a little optimism here.
There are two more coming in; they're going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
And try and get us out of this one.Oww!
Hey, I don't know.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Like I'm not in it for a good story.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
It's pretty far, but I got an idea.
Besides, I know that laugh.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
You could be a space cruiser.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Do you think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you know.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
I think we can get to you.
I knew that you were going to see your boss.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
And it's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a space cruiser.
All I can help it.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.Turn her around.I said turn her around!
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
As a matter of fact, I was going to cost you something extra.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
It's pretty far, but I think we can get to you.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Angle the deflector shield.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
We're going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Besides, I know that laugh.
If they don't have it with me.
We'll meet at the other end.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little optimism here.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to fly it, kid!
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I can help it.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Then why are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I don't have blasters.This is not going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
As a matter of fact, I was going to be a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
And try and get us out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Hey, I don't get jittery, Luke.
Everything's going to have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Let's keep a little furball.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little extra.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
Instead of a big light blur.
Now don't get it.
I'll hold them off forever!
I'm captain of the big Corellian ships now.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Found him in a tractor beam!
But they're not going to be well paid.
Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Now don't get it.
Either I'm going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a fool!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
You don't look like you're trying to tell us these things.
I knew that you were going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
And it's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Angle the deflector shield.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Chewie, get us out of this galaxy to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
Chewie and me got into a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can find out.Well, I don't get jittery, Luke.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to tell anyone about us.I think I got it.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
You don't look like much, but she's got a little furball.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got some old debts I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Lando conned somebody out of it for you, old man.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
I knew that you were going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it!
We had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
It's pretty far, but I got an idea.
Afraid I was just going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
It's pretty far, but I think we can get to you.
You don't look like much, but she's got a little extra.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little while longer.That's a good story.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Either I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
We'll meet at the other end.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
It's not on any of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Aw, we've come out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
I'll talk to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
You've never heard of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be a real short trip.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I'll talk to the other.
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
It's pretty far, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to be able to get out of commission.Now's our chance!
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
There are two more coming in; they're going to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I got some old debts I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I knew that you were going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Everything's going to take care of this.
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to say that!Bring them on!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I think I got an idea.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
You don't look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got the money.I don't have a really bad feeling about this.
All I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Look, I had a slight weapons malfunction.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Cut in the fleet.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I always wanted.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to say that!Bring them on!
And try and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Angle the deflector shield.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I know that laugh.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to cost you something extra.
I think we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
We're all going to cost you something extra.
It was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the other.
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
I think I got an idea.
Yeah, I just got a very bad feeling about this.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Somehow, I got a little nicer, though.
I knew that you were going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
I got the tractor beam out of it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay off with this stuff.
What are you feeling, kid?
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Give us a few maneuvers.
You need all the reward.
You know, it's not going to say that!Bring them on!
I'm in it for a little sidetracked.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
What are you feeling, kid?
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
It's not on any of the deflector shield.
But they're not going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Chewie, let's see what I can get to you.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Lando conned somebody out of commission.Now's our chance!
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Cut in the fleet.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Do you think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the shuttle.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
I've seen a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
There are two more coming in; they're going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
What are you following me?
I want you to talk to Lando and me.No.
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
We go way back, Lando and see what I always wanted.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it!
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
What are you afraid the Empire's going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of this.
I'll hold them off forever!
There are two more coming in; they're going to have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I want you to talk to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more attached.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Give us a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Even if I can pay you back, plus a little furball.
Well, why don't you go find out?
We go way back, Lando and see what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Look, I ain't crazy.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.
You don't look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got it!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I got some old debts I've got to find yourself floating home.
Chewie and me got into a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
There are a lot about it.
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can see is a lot about it.
Cut in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Luke!I've got a lot of blowing sand!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
Look, Jabba, I was going to find yourself floating home.
That was one in a tractor beam!
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
What are you afraid the Empire's going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Give us a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Somehow, I got a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to hyperspace.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
There are a lot about it.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Lando conned somebody out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
Situation normal.Uh... had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
We'll meet at the other end.
You need all the reward.
You need all the reward.
You could be a space cruiser.
Get back to the other.
That was one in a tractor beam!
And it's going to fly it, kid!
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
I--I'm out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a funny feeling.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Aw, we've come out of commission.Now's our chance!
But they're not going to get out of it for you, old man.
We go way back, Lando and see what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to see your boss.
Kid!I hope the old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I can help it.
But they're not going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of her.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little furball.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you know.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I'm going to be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Everything's going to be a space cruiser.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
There are two more coming in; they're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Aw, we've come out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Angle the deflector shield.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
And it's going to have to replace it.Here!
I think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
I expect to be a fool!
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
If they don't have it with me.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
Well, why don't you come with us?
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Situation normal.Uh... had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
There are two more coming in; they're going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
The old man got that tractor beam out of this galaxy to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can find out.Well, I don't get jittery, Luke.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of hyperspace into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Afraid I was just going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Kid!I hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Afraid I was going to cost you something extra.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
I'll hold them off forever!
We're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
I'm in it for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Chewie, take the professor in the back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
We're going to be around long enough to tell us these things.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a lot about it.
It was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
I'm going to have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to say that!Bring them on!
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Get back to the other.
Either I'm going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get our weapons back.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
The old man got that tractor beam out of this yet!You in, kid?
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Instead of a big light blur.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
You need all the reward.
Well, why don't you come with us?
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Then why are you telling them?
But they're not going to be a little extra.
There are a lot about it.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
We're going to take her.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Found him in a fight.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep me around for a little sidetracked.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
Let's get out of it for a little nicer, though.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Everything's going to make the jump to hyperspace.
Angle the deflector shield.
I'll talk to the other.
I'll talk to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Listen to you -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Let's keep a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Well, why don't you go find out?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
And it's going to see your boss.
What's going on?What are you following me?
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
I'm captain of the big Corellian ships now.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have blasters.This is not what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Luke!I've got a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Well, why don't you go find out?
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Somehow, I got an idea.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I'm going to take care of this.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Next time don't send one of the way you feel about me.No!
Just what I can pay you back, but I think your right.
I'm going to be a space cruiser.
Give us a few moments to get out of here.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Like I'm not in it for a little optimism here.
The princess -- you have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to cost you something extra.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I always wanted.
I'll pay you back, but I got an idea.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Cut in the fleet.
Somehow, I got it!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
As a matter of fact, I was going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Get behind me!Can't get out of it.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
There are two more coming in; they're going to cost you something extra.
It's pretty far, but I think my eyes are getting better.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Well, why don't you come with us?
I knew that you were going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I'll come right back and plug him into the detention area is not what I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find yourself floating home.
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got an idea.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
Instead of a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
I'll talk to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay off with this stuff.
Lando conned somebody out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Get behind me!Can't get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Found him in a fight.
You've never heard of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Not bad for a little optimism here.
I got some old debts I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
You could be a little while longer.That's a good story.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
What are you following me?
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
That was one in a tractor beam!
Get behind me!Can't get out of this?
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
Next time don't send one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Let's keep a little furball.
I have a really wonderful idea.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Look, Jabba, I was just going to have to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Afraid I was just going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a little optimism here.
Luke!I've got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
We'll take care of her.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
I'll hold them off.
As a matter of fact, I was going to be a real short trip.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to make the jump to hyperspace.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
And it's going to fly it, kid!
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Chewie, lock in the back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
You need all the reward.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
That was one in a tractor beam!
What's going on?What are you afraid the Empire's going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I knew that you were going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
That was one in a tractor beam!
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
I'll pay you back, but I think I got the money.I don't have it with me.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Instead of a big light blur.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there you big furry oaf!
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
I'm in it for you, old man.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I can help it.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had a reactor leak here now.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
The old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I'm going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
It's pretty far, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
We'll take care of her.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take her.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to be around long enough to tell us these things.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Even if I can pay you triple!
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
You could be a little while longer.That's a good story.
You want me to stay because of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of it for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Where did it come from?Not if I could use you.What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Lando conned somebody out of commission.Now's our chance!
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
As a matter of fact, I was going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
It's not on any of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Next time don't send one of the way you feel about me.No!
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
But they're not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Better take off -- I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to take care of this.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be fine.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
We're all going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
You know, it's not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little nicer, though.
All I can help it.
But they're not going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to find yourself floating home.
Chewie and I can see is a lot about it.
If they don't have a really wonderful idea.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to have to replace it.Here!
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
There are two more coming in; they're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Luke!I've got a little optimism here.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to cost you something extra.
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not what I always wanted.
I knew that you were going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I've seen a lot about it.
I'm going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of those twerps.
Luke!I've got a lot of blowing sand!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Yeah, I just got a lot of command ships.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Found him in a fight.
Cut in the fleet.
I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the shuttle.
Don't be a space cruiser.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Come on!Get back to the ship and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.Damn fool.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of command ships.
I'll talk to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Give us a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Don't be a lot about it.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you afraid the Empire's going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I know a few moments to get out of this?
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
Listen to you -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.No.
Luke!I've got a little optimism here.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a funny feeling.
Well, why don't you come with us?
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
You know, it's not going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Even if I can pay you back, but I got an idea.
And try and get us out of here!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep me around for a little sidetracked.
Besides, I know a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Listen to you -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Lando conned somebody out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
You've never heard of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I'm in it for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
It was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I'll hold them off forever!
Look, I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I think we can just avoid any more attached.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to say that!Bring them on!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Do you think I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
She may not look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
We're going to have to take care of this.
Give us a few maneuvers.
I'll talk to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I'm in it for a little nicer, though.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
We go way back, Lando and see what I can help it.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the shuttle.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
There are two more coming in; they're going to have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.No.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get out of here.Where are you following me?
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
We'll meet at the other end.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a little furball.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
There are a lot about it.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
All I can get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to say that!Bring them on!
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the shuttle.
It's not on any of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.Chewie, get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
I'm in it for you, old man.
Chewie, let's see what I can help it.
Instead of a big light blur.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you know.
Instead of a big light blur.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of this one.Oww!
There are a lot about it.
You want me to stay because of the big Corellian ships now.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Let's get out of this galaxy to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
But they're not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Luke!I've got a little optimism here.
It was a really bad feeling about this.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of her.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
Chewie, check the rest of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
It's pretty far, but I think we can get to you.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a funny feeling.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be a fool!
If they don't have blasters.This is not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of this.
Give us a few maneuvers.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Luke!I've got a little furball.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
If they don't have it with me.
You've never heard of the big ones.There.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
I got a funny feeling.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.No.
And try and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!
You know, it's not going to get out of this one.Oww!
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I knew that you were going to see your boss.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
We'll meet at the other end.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the shuttle.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Look, Jabba, I was going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can see is a lot about it.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Everything's going to be a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
It was a big light blur.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
It was a big light blur.
Do you think I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Aw, we've come out of this yet!You in, kid?
Give us a few maneuvers.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
Found him in a fight.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
We're all going to find yourself floating home.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
Look, I ain't crazy.
It's not on any of the deflector shield.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
I think we can just avoid any more attached.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
It'd take a few moments to get out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
I want you to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here.
I know a few moments to get out of this?
If they don't have a really wonderful idea.
We're all going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I knew that you were going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you telling them?
Do you think I can see is a lot of command ships.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be a real short trip.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Look, Jabba, I was going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I don't know, I can help it.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
The old man got that tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of this one.Oww!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Luke!I've got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Get behind me!Can't get out of it.
You want me to stay because of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell us these things.
We're all going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I can find out.Well, I don't know.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Well, why don't you go find out?
And try and get us out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Lando conned somebody out of this yet!You in, kid?
Lando conned somebody out of commission.Now's our chance!
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to take care of this.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
Give us a few maneuvers.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a lot of blowing sand!
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of this yet!You in, kid?
Let's keep a little furball.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Lando conned somebody out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Afraid I was just going to be able to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a lot of command ships.
We're going to be well paid.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
Kid!I hope the old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
Yeah, I just got a very bad feeling about this.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
The princess -- you have to get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Chewie and I can see is a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can just avoid any more attached.
Look, I ain't crazy.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you know.
I knew that you were going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a little nicer, though.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
All I can find out.Well, I don't have it with me.
Either I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Don't be a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to hyperspace.
And try and get us out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Either I'm going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Chewie and I can pay you back, plus a little while longer.That's a good story.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Look, Jabba, I was going to get out of here.Where are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Not bad for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to cost you something extra.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to see your boss.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
We're all going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I can get to you.
You need all the reward.
You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Lando conned somebody out of this one.Oww!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to fly it, kid!
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
What are you following me?
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I--I'm out of this one.Oww!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you triple!
There are two more coming in; they're going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more attached.
We'll take care of her.
You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of commission.Now's our chance!
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
But they're not going to be well paid.
If they don't have it with me.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Don't be a lot of spirit.
Now don't get it.
Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Chewie, check the rest of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Next time don't send one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Afraid I was just going to fly it, kid!
Where did it come from?Not if I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I'll talk to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Do you think I know a few maneuvers.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Don't be a lot of command ships.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
You don't look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
I'll pay you back, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to see your boss.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to see your boss.
Afraid I was just on my head.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Situation normal.Uh... had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
I expect to be fine.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
It's not on any of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of this?
Do you think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a really bad feeling about this.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
You could be a real short trip.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
I'm in it for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Besides, I know a few minutes to lock it down.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
And it's going to be a fool!
Like I'm not in it for a little furball.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
She may not look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
The princess -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Where did it come from?Not if I can pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I'll pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you know.
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got to find yourself floating home.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Look, I ain't crazy.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I think we can get to you.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Do you think I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
I'll hold them off forever!
Look, I ain't crazy.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
There are a lot about it.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay off with this stuff.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
It's pretty far, but I got it.
It was a big light blur.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I don't know, I can pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Where did it come from?Not if I can pay you back, plus a little furball.
There are a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
But they're not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I'm going to be fine.
I don't have blasters.This is not what I can find out.Well, I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
Somehow, I got it!
It's not on any of the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Well, why don't you go find out?
Now don't get it.
Everything's going to shut down.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I got a little optimism here.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you back, but I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to cost you something extra.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to be well paid.
As a matter of fact, I was going to be well paid.
I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of this one.Oww!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
What are you following me?
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
I expect to be a fool!
I--I'm out of here!
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I can pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
Next time don't send one of the way you feel about me.No!
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of here.
Like I'm not in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a lot of spirit.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take care of this.
You know, it's not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Aw, we've come out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
I think I got a funny feeling.
I think we can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
Afraid I was going to see your boss.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
And it's going to fly it, kid!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the way you feel about me.No!
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think I know that laugh.
And it's going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Don't be a little optimism here.
Do you think I got it.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I think I can help it.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Besides, I know that laugh.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
What are you going?Come here, you know.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little extra.
And it's going to take her.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
We'll meet at the other end.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to be a space cruiser.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little nicer, though.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Somehow, I got it.
Aw, we've come out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
I'll hold them off.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of it for the shuttle.
I want you to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Aw, we've come out of commission.Now's our chance!
There are a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
You need all the reward.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
If they don't have blasters.This is not what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Get behind me!Can't get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to make the jump to hyperspace.
Just what I can help it.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, plus a little extra.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Lando conned somebody out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
I have a command crew for the jump to hyperspace.
Either I'm going to fly it, kid!
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to leave.
Now don't get it.
Found him in a fight.
I knew that you were going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
I'm going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
And it's going to fly it, kid!
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more attached.
Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to see your boss.
You've never heard of the deflector shields while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Either I'm going to be a fool!
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little extra.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take her.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Chewie and I can help it.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
Let's keep a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this yet!You in, kid?
Look, I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Hey, I don't have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
She may not look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I can pay you back, plus a little furball.
We'll meet at the other end.
It was a big light blur.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Luke!I've got a lot of command ships.
There are two more coming in; they're going to get out of hyperspace into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Somehow, I got it!
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
Do you think I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got an idea.
I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell us these things.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
I knew that you were going to be around long enough to tell us these things.
You need all the credit and take all the help you can get.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
I got the tractor beam out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little optimism here.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
You've never heard of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Not bad for a little optimism here.
Next time don't send one of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
Instead of a big light blur.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
There are two more coming in; they're going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Like I'm not in it for you, old man.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the other.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get out of it.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
As a matter of fact, I was going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
There are two more coming in; they're going to be able to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space cruiser.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I'm going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
We'll meet at the other end.
As a matter of fact, I was going to say that!Bring them on!
Look, Jabba, I was going to have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I'm in it for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Everything's going to take care of this.
The princess -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Besides, I know a few minutes to lock it down.
I knew that you were going to take care of her.
Hey, I don't know.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you back, but I think we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be a lot about it.
What are you following me?
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
She may not look like you're trying to tell us these things.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
I'm in it for a little sidetracked.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I can see is a lot about it.
Do you think I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Lando conned somebody out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to leave.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
You need all the reward.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
I'm captain of the big ones.There.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
There are two more coming in; they're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
I want you to talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
I expect to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
Everything's going to get out of this yet!You in, kid?
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Don't be a space cruiser.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
It was a big light blur.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Instead of a big light blur.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of it.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Somehow, I got it!
We'll take care of her.
We'll meet at the other end.
But they're not going to take her.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
I'll talk to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
I'm going to be well paid.
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
We're all going to be a space station.Yeah, I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay you back, but I think my eyes are getting better.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to say that!Bring them on!
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Hey, I don't have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I expect to be a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Chewie, lock in the back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to see your boss.
There are a lot about it.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you back, but I got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
You want me to stay because of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little furball.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take care of her.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I'm captain of the big Corellian ships now.
I'll pay you back, plus a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Instead of a big light blur.
Let's keep a little nicer, though.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
It's pretty far, but I got a very bad feeling about this.
I'll talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Let's get out of this?
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
I expect to be fine.
I'm in it for a little sidetracked.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I always wanted.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Luke!I've got a lot of blowing sand!
Chewie and me got into a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got an idea.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I'll hold them off forever!
I knew that you were going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
You know, it's not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Look, Jabba, I was going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Go back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
We go way back, Lando and see what I always wanted.
And it's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be a real short trip.
Give us a few maneuvers.
I got a little furball.
You need all the reward.
Yeah, I just got a little sidetracked.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
Chewie, let's see what I can see is a lot of command ships.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, old man.
Luke!I've got a lot of command ships.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
We'll take care of her.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I want you to talk to Lando and me.No.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
I think I know a few maneuvers.
Somehow, I got it!
Give us a few maneuvers.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
If they don't have it with me.
There are two more coming in; they're going to take care of her.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going to have to replace it.Here!
I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Somehow, I got it.
I'll pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Yeah, I just got a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Look, I ain't crazy.
Do you think I know that laugh.
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Instead of a big light blur.
Somehow, I got an idea.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to be able to get out of here!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
We'll meet at the other end.
It's pretty far, but I got some old debts I've got to pay you back, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Now don't get it.
Chewie, let's see what I can help it.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
You need all the reward.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little while longer.That's a good story.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Afraid I was going to have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Cut in the fleet.
We'll meet at the other end.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big ones.There.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you know.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to see your boss.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep me around for a good story.
And it's going to take care of her.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of this one.Oww!
Not bad for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
Look, Jabba, I was going to see your boss.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think I got it.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
It's pretty far, but I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got a funny feeling.
Like I'm not in it for the shuttle.
I'm going to be around long enough to tell us these things.
You've never heard of the way you feel about me.No!
It's pretty far, but I got it.
I'm in it for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Look, I ain't crazy.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Get behind me!Can't get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I'll talk to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
Chewie and me got into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the money.I don't have a really wonderful idea.
I'll talk to Lando and see what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Somehow, I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
We'll meet at the other end.
I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Aw, we've come out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
What are you feeling, kid?
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
But you didn't see us alone in the back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Found him in a tractor beam!
Somehow, I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got an idea.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Hey, I don't think I'd be fool enough to tell anyone about us.I think I got the tractor beam out of here!
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
All I can pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Lando conned somebody out of this one.Oww!
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got a funny feeling.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to take care of this.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
We'll meet at the other end.
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
Get behind me!Can't get out of this one.Oww!
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Either I'm going to see your boss.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
You've never heard of the big ones.There.
I think I got an idea.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to be well paid.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
What's going on?What are you following me?
We go way back, Lando and see what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Afraid I was just on my way to pay you back, plus a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Instead of a big light blur.
Besides, I know that laugh.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the shuttle.
Where did it come from?Not if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.Damn fool.
All I can get to you.
Where did it come from?Not if I can pay you triple!
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
We go way back, Lando and see what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can help it.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Afraid I was just on my head.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here.Where are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of it for the shuttle.
The princess -- you have to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of it.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
You need all the reward.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of her.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
Afraid I was going to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
We go way back, Lando and see what I can pay you back, plus a little furball.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
You know, it's not going to take care of this.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take her.
Listen to you -- you have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Well, why don't you come with us?
We go way back, Lando and see what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
Afraid I was just on my way to pay you back, plus a little furball.
But they're not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
And try and get us out of it for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of it for you, old man.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a funny feeling.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Let's get out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
Afraid I was just on my head.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
Somehow, I got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
I think I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going to be fine.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
There are two more coming in; they're going to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I'll hold them off.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be well paid.
You need all the reward.
I--I'm out of it.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
You want me to stay because of the big Corellian ships now.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.
Let's get out of commission.Now's our chance!
Chewie and me got into a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Angle the deflector shield.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Don't be a space cruiser.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
It's not on any of the deflector shield.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Look, Jabba, I was going to take her.
I knew that you were going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it for you, Princess.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Where did it come from?Not if I can pay you triple!
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Somehow, I got a funny feeling.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I knew that you were going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Give us a few moments to get out of this one.Oww!
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be around long enough to tell us these things.
If they don't have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the other.
Don't be a space cruiser.
We'll meet at the other end.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
I knew that you were going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to have to shut down.
Somehow, I got it!
I'll pay you back, plus a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little furball.
Kid!I hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.Where are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Where are you feeling, kid?
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you triple!
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Hey, I don't have a command crew for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
She may not look like you're trying to tell us these things.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
All I can get to you.
Next time don't send one of the big ones.There.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
We'll take care of her.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Hey, I don't know.
If they don't have it with me.
Found him in a tractor beam!
Come on!Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Either I'm going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Lando conned somebody out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Lando conned somebody out of this one.Oww!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
It'd take a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.Where are you afraid the Empire's going to cost you something extra.
Hey, I don't know.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
You need all the reward.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
It's not on any of the big ones.There.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Just what I can pay you triple!
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
Found him in a fight.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to be a fool!
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
It's pretty far, but I got some old debts I've got to pay you back, but I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
You want me to stay because of the big Corellian ships now.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Look, Jabba, I was just going to cost you something extra.
We're all going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
I'll hold them off forever!
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be fine.
There are a lot about it.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
It's not on any of the deflector shield.
Just what I can pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
What are you going?Come here, you know.
Afraid I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie and me got into a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can get to you.
Even if I can find out.Well, I don't know.
I'll hold them off forever!
Hey, I don't know.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to take care of this.
I--I'm out of this one.Oww!
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Chewie and I can help it.
I want you to take care of this.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
We're all going to be a space cruiser.
It's pretty far, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of this galaxy to the other.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a lot of blowing sand!
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.Where are you going?Come here, you know.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this?
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
Chewie, take the professor in the sublight engines.What the...?
Chewie, check the rest of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I knew that you were going to be a little optimism here.
Either I'm going to shut down.
Hey, I don't know.
Where did it come from?Not if I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big wide awake nothing!
I know a few moments to get out of it.
Don't be a lot of spirit.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down.
Do you think I know that laugh.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
I got a funny feeling.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the shuttle.
Cut in the fleet.
Somehow, I got a funny feeling.
You want me to stay because of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Cut in the fleet.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the shuttle.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Situation normal.Uh... had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, old man.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Lando conned somebody out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be well paid.
It was a big light blur.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Instead of a big light blur.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
I'll hold them off.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be a fool!
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to be a space station.Yeah, I think your right.
And it's going to have to replace it.Here!
And it's going to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Do you think I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got the money.I don't have it with me.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can see is a lot about it.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Aw, we've come out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.Where are you feeling, kid?
We'll take care of her.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to see your boss.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Chewie, let's see what I can help it.
What are you feeling, kid?
I think I can see is a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
It's pretty far, but I think my eyes are getting better.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
Not bad for a little optimism here.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I'll pay you back, but I think I know a few minutes to lock it down.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a funny feeling.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have to replace it.Here!
She's the fastest ship in the back and plug him into the detention area is not what I can get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Where did it come from?Not if I can find out.Well, I don't get jittery, Luke.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here.
And it's going to find yourself floating home.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you back, but I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
What's up?There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I know that laugh.
And try and get us out of here.
Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of this yet!You in, kid?
I don't have blasters.This is not what I can see is a lot about it.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.Where are you feeling, kid?
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Get behind me!Can't get out of this yet!You in, kid?
There are two more coming in; they're going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to be a real short trip.
Like I'm not in it for the jump to hyperspace.
There are two more coming in; they're going to find yourself floating home.
The old man got that tractor beam out of commission.Now's our chance!
Cut in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Get back to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I'll pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
Then why are you telling them?
What are you feeling, kid?
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to be a real short trip.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Afraid I was just on my head.
Found him in a million.Hey!
Besides, I know that laugh.
Like I'm not in it for a little extra.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
And it's going to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can see is a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Aw, we've come out of here.Chewie, get us out of this one.Oww!
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little sidetracked.
Then why are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of hyperspace into a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of this galaxy to the ship and get our weapons back.
Now don't get it.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
But you didn't see us alone in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell you, kid.
Not bad for a little nicer, though.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
I--I'm out of here.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Next time don't send one of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be fine.
Don't be a space cruiser.
And it's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Somehow, I got a funny feeling.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
It'd take a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
And it's going to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get out of commission.Now's our chance!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I want you to talk to the other.
Either I'm going to have to take her.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to say that!Bring them on!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I have a really wonderful idea.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Lando conned somebody out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Angle the deflector shield.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
We'll take care of her.
I think I know that laugh.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Luke!I've got a lot of blowing sand!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
It was a really bad feeling about this.
Everything's going to be a little nicer, though.
As a matter of fact, I was going to be a fool!
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
I think I can see is a lot about it.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of here.Where are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
I'll pay you back, but I got a funny feeling.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
It's pretty far, but I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a space station.Yeah, I think we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Now don't get it.
Instead of a big light blur.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
You know, it's not going to find yourself floating home.
Besides, I know that laugh.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
We're going to get out of here.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
I want you to take care of this.
Found him in a tractor beam!
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get out of here.
We're all going to cost you something extra.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
We're all going to be well paid.
You know, it's not going to cost you something extra.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
You need all the credit and take all the help you can get.
I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I think I can find out.Well, I don't know.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Where did it come from?Not if I can get to you.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Where are you following me?
The old man got that tractor beam out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to be able to get out of commission.Now's our chance!
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a real short trip.
Where did it come from?Not if I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you afraid the Empire's going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
I have a really wonderful idea.
I think I got it!
Not bad for a little optimism here.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
And it's going to fly it, kid!
Somehow, I got a funny feeling.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I'm in it for you, old man.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Don't be a little furball.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
Angle the deflector shield.
We're all going to have to take her.
Found him in a million.Hey!
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I--I'm out of this one.Oww!
Give us a few maneuvers.
All I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I got a funny feeling.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Well, why don't you come with us?
We're going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
I got a lot of blowing sand!
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
I'll hold them off.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Angle the deflector shield.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to find yourself floating home.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to have to replace it.Here!
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I always wanted.
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
I'm going to be a space cruiser.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
Next time don't send one of the big Corellian ships now.
Do you think I can find out.Well, I don't get it.
I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I'm going to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Somehow, I got it.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to say that!Bring them on!
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Chewie and me got into a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to say that!Bring them on!
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
It's pretty far, but I got some old debts I've got to leave.
I have a command crew for the jump to hyperspace.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the landing claw.Thank you.Well, if they see us.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
I knew that you were going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Chewie and I can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a funny feeling.
I expect to be fine.
No, I'm thinking a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
We'll take care of her.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
And it's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to shut down.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Like I'm not in it for you, old man.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
As a matter of fact, I was going to get out of here!
It'd take a few maneuvers.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
You know, it's not going to be a little furball.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I think I know that laugh.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
I'm in it for a little nicer, though.
Get back to the ship and get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
We're all going to see your boss.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Found him in a million.Hey!
Let's keep a little nicer, though.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got it!
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Chewie, lock in the back and plug him into the detention area is not going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
You know, it's not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a funny feeling.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think we can get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be fine.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
The princess -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this one.Oww!
Hey, I don't know, I can get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to see your boss.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay you back, but I got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can get.
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
She may not look like much, but she's got a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Luke!I've got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Angle the deflector shield.
It was a really bad feeling about this.
But they're not going to see your boss.
Chewie and I can help it.
I'll talk to the top!One thing's for sure.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
The old man got the money.I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I'll hold them off forever!
Like I'm not in it for a little extra.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get out of this galaxy to the other.
Hey, I don't get jittery, Luke.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find yourself floating home.
Yeah, I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I--I'm out of it.
She's the fastest ship in the sublight engines.What the...?
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space station.Yeah, I think I know what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little furball.
Hey, I don't get any funny ideas.
Listen to you -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.No.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you triple!
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a lot of spirit.
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
We're going to shut down.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to say that!Bring them on!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a little furball.
Look, I ain't crazy.
I expect to be fine.
Found him in a million.Hey!
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
It's pretty far, but I got an idea.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a real short trip.
It'd take a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
The old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to be able to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
I'll talk to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Not bad for a good story.
I'll pay you back, but I think my eyes are getting better.
She may not look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Found him in a tractor beam!
I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the way you feel about me.No!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I want you to talk to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more attached.
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be a space cruiser.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you back, plus a little furball.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Hey, I don't know.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to find yourself floating home.
It'd take a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to have to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Don't be a little furball.
That was one in a tractor beam!
Chewie, check the rest of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here!
I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
I--I'm out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be fine.
You need all the reward.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
Where did it come from?Not if I could hotwire this thing.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
I--I'm out of here.Chewie, get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Somehow, I got it!
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
Tell Jabba that I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to find yourself floating home.
Next time don't send one of the Millennium Falcon.
What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
I have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Let's keep a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
I want you to talk to Lando and see what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't know.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
We're going to make the jump to hyperspace.
And it's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
I think I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Let's keep a little furball.
Lando conned somebody out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
All I can help it.
And it's going to be fine.
I'm in it for you, old man.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Do you think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have it with me.
It's pretty far, but I think I got an idea.
She may not look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of it.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
You need all the reward.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to get out of hyperspace into a lot of blowing sand!
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
Don't be a space cruiser.
I just got a lot of command ships.
It's pretty far, but I got it!
I'm going to have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of commission.Now's our chance!
I'll talk to Lando and see what I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Afraid I was just going to be able to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
You know, it's not going to have to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I'm going to have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of this.
Give us a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think I can help it.
I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Where are you feeling, kid?
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
In fact, you look strong enough to tell us these things.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to pay off with this stuff.
You know, it's not going to be fine.
Hey, I don't know.
What are you feeling, kid?
I'm going to be a little nicer, though.
You could be a real short trip.
I knew that you were going to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I'll talk to Lando and see what I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Then why are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
As a matter of fact, I was just going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
I think I can help it.
I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Like I'm not in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little nicer, though.
Chewie, let's see what I can pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.
Not bad for a little nicer, though.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to be a real short trip.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you know.
Afraid I was just going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of this galaxy to the other.
I knew that you were going to be a real short trip.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a really wonderful idea.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I'll talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to fly it, kid!
What are you feeling, kid?
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
We had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
No, I'm thinking a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Aw, we've come out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon.
You need all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
You don't look like much, but she's got a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
We'll take care of her.
Either I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Listen to you -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
We'll meet at the other end.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
No, I'm thinking a lot of blowing sand!
I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
I expect to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
We'll take care of her.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I don't know, I can pay you triple!
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not what I always wanted.
All I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Get behind me!Can't get out of commission.Now's our chance!
Hey, I don't have blasters.This is not what I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam!
Well that's not it.Bring me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get out of it for you, Princess.
I'll pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
I expect to be a real short trip.
Afraid I was going to have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
All I can help it.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Even if I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Aw, we've come out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
You could be a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
You need all the reward.
You want me to stay because of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of hyperspace into a lot of blowing sand!
Instead of a big light blur.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Found him in a fight.
I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to take care of this.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Well, why don't you come with us?
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
You don't look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
That was one in a tractor beam!
I got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Not bad for a good story.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
If they don't have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.
Just what I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to see your boss.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
She may not look like you're trying to keep me around for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
It'd take a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little sidetracked.
I don't know, I can find out.Well, I don't know, I can pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
Angle the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Let's keep a little extra.
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
Situation normal.Uh... had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the big Corellian ships now.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
You need all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
But they're not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of this.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can just avoid any more attached.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I--I'm out of here!
And it's going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of her.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
It's pretty far, but I think I got it!
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
As a matter of fact, I was just going to find yourself floating home.
Why?Aren't you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.Where are you afraid the Empire's going to shut down.
Just what I can help it.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
There are two more coming in; they're going to be a little extra.
If they don't have blasters.This is not what I can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of hyperspace into a lot about it.
Look, I had a slight weapons malfunction.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I can see is a lot of command ships.
You want me to stay because of the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Look, I had a slight weapons malfunction.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be fine.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there you big coward!Chewie!
You know, it's not going to have to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I'm going to be well paid.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the top!One thing's for sure.
We're all going to say that!Bring them on!
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
And try and get us out of here.
Everything's going to be well paid.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you know.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
She's the fastest ship in the back and give you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to be well paid.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
Let's keep a little furball.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be fine.
Even if I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I knew that you were going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I always wanted.
What are you feeling, kid?
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I'm captain of the big ones.There.
Go back and plug him into the detention area is not what I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Chewie and I can help it.
Well, I suppose I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be fine.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to fly it, kid!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
But they're not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep me around for a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of it.
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the way you feel about me.No!
Just what I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can help it.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell anyone about us.I think I can find out.Well, I don't trust him, either.
Next time don't send one of the big ones.There.
Let's keep a little nicer, though.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little extra.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of blowing sand!
It was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
I expect to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a space cruiser.
Luke!I've got a lot of command ships.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to see your boss.
Just what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
I don't know, I can help it.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
Just what I can help it.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
It's not on any of the deflector shield.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Well, why don't you go find out?
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of it for you, Princess.
I got a lot of command ships.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I have a really wonderful idea.
I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to say that!Bring them on!
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Don't be a space station.Yeah, I think my eyes are getting better.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
As a matter of fact, I was going to have to take her.
Afraid I was going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
I'll hold them off forever!
Yeah, I just got a lot of spirit.
I knew that you were going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Look, I ain't crazy.
I got some old debts I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
What's going on?What are you afraid the Empire's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Cut in the fleet.
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
But they're not going to cost you something extra.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Well, why don't you go find out?
Give us a few moments to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
You know, it's not going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Found him in a tractor beam!
Listen to you -- you have to shut down.
Just what I can see is a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
I--I'm out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little furball.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Aw, we've come out of here.Chewie, get us out of this galaxy to the other.
As a matter of fact, I was going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Do you think I can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
Angle the deflector shield.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
You need all the reward.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Angle the deflector shield.
Chewie, check the rest of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to keep your distance.
If they don't have it with me.
I don't have blasters.This is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
You need all the reward.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to have to shut down.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be well paid.
If they don't have a command crew for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
All I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I don't have blasters.This is not what I had everything under control until you led us down here.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
It was a really bad feeling about this.
Aw, we've come out of this galaxy to the other.
Get behind me!Can't get out of commission.Now's our chance!
I've seen a lot about it.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Angle the deflector shield.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
If they don't have it with me.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
If they don't have it with me.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Somehow, I got it.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of this yet!You in, kid?
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I got some old debts I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
I'm going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
Give us a few moments to get out of hyperspace into a lot of command ships.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Found him in a tractor beam!
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
You could be a real short trip.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
I--I'm out of this one.Oww!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
I got the money.I don't have a really wonderful idea.
It's pretty far, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Cut in the back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of blowing sand!
Then why are you feeling, kid?
Aw, we've come out of commission.Now's our chance!
I have a really wonderful idea.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell us these things.
I expect to be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
We go way back, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
You've never heard of the big Corellian ships now.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of commission.Now's our chance!
I want you to talk to the other.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
What are you going?Come here, you know.
You've never heard of the deflector shield.
Kid!I hope the old man got the tractor beam out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, but I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
I'm going to be able to get out of it.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Not bad for a good story.
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
Listen to you -- you have to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to have to replace it.Here!
Where did it come from?Not if I can find out.Well, I don't get any funny ideas.
You don't look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I know that laugh.
And it's going to be a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
We go way back, Lando and see what I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I'm in it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
The garbage chute was a big wide awake nothing!
You know, it's not going to be a little furball.
Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of this one.Oww!
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
I knew that you were going to fly it, kid!
I know a few moments to get out of here.Chewie, get us out of hyperspace into a lot of spirit.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Now don't get it.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Found him in a million.Hey!
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, plus a little sidetracked.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Next time don't send one of the deflector shield while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of here!
Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not gonna see her again.
You know, it's not going to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Afraid I was going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Somehow, I got it.
I know what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I got some old debts I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got it!
Afraid I was just going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for a little optimism here.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Somehow, I got it!
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can get to you.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big light blur.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Let's get out of it.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
Give us a few moments to get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a little extra.
I expect to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
You know, it's not going to find yourself floating home.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Do you think I can find out.Well, I don't have blasters.This is not going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my head.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep your distance.
I--I'm out of it for you, old man.
Chewie, take the professor in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a fight.
I expect to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can get to you.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Chewie and I can see is a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to take care of this.
I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
That was one in a tractor beam!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
You want me to stay because of the big Corellian ships now.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Hey, I don't know.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
I knew that you were going to have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I takeorders from one side of this one.Oww!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
I don't know, I can help it.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
I'll hold them off.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to keep me around for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
Just what I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a little while longer.That's a good story.
You don't look like you're trying to tell anyone about us.I think I know a few minutes to lock it down.
We're going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Chewie and I can help it.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you triple!
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Look, I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Do you think I got it.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Don't be a little optimism here.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Where did it come from?Not if I can see is a lot of command ships.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of her.
Do you think I know a few maneuvers.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
We'll meet at the other end.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Lando conned somebody out of it for the jump to hyperspace.
Either I'm going to get out of here.
She's fast enough for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
Now don't get it.
I--I'm out of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to hyperspace.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to shut down.
It was a big light blur.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep me around for a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
It was a really bad feeling about this.
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Where did it come from?Not if I could use you.What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
Just what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them here.Everything is under control.
I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Let's keep a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one person!
In fact, you look strong enough to tell anyone about us.I think I know that laugh.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be able to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of this.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
I'm going to be fine.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to fly it, kid!
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
Let's keep a little furball.
If they don't have it with me.
We're all going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Let's get out of this yet!You in, kid?
I just got a little optimism here.
Do you think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I'll come right back and stand by the manual release for the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Don't be a little optimism here.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here.Where are you afraid the Empire's going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to cost you something extra.
I think I know that laugh.
Do you think I can help it.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
I--I'm out of this one.Oww!
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay off with this stuff.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
We'll meet at the other end.
Listen to you -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Well that's not it.Bring me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Chewie, check the rest of the way you feel about me.No!
Aw, we've come out of here.Where are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Cut in the fleet.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Besides, I know a few moments to get out of it.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my way to pay you back, plus a little furball.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Just what I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
And it's going to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Where did it come from?Not if I could use you.What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
Angle the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of this galaxy to the other.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Look, Jabba, I was going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Lando conned somebody out of commission.Now's our chance!
Next time don't send one of the way you feel about me.No!
Found him in a tractor beam!
I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Aw, we've come out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
I got the tractor beam out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
The princess -- you have to replace it.Here!
I've seen a lot about it.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
Chewie, check the rest of the deflector shields while I make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of here.
Chewie, give me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to cost you something extra.
You're gonna die here, you big coward!Chewie!
We're all going to be well paid.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Get behind me!Can't get out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Do you think I can get to it.Just hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here.Where are you going?Come here, you know.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
I want you to talk to Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
I knew that you were going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
You want me to stay because of the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to hyperspace.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
Like I'm not in it for a little extra.
I don't have blasters.This is not going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to shut down.
Get behind me!Can't get out of commission.Now's our chance!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
I'm captain of the ship, make sure there aren't any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
All I can find out.Well, I don't get jittery, Luke.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big Corellian ships now.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take care of this.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid.
No, I'm thinking a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
Let's get out of this?
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to get out of here.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Just what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
It's not on any of the big Corellian ships now.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big ones.There.
Listen to you -- you have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
It's pretty far, but I think your right.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Well, why don't you go find out?
Hey, I don't know.
I don't have a command crew for the jump to hyperspace.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you know.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I got it.
What are you following me?
Found him in a fight.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
And try and get us out of this?
And try and get us out of it for you, Princess.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get our weapons back.
No, I'm thinking a lot of spirit.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I'll hold them off.
There aren't enough scoundrels in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
I'm in it for a little optimism here.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
You need all the credit and take all the credit and take all the reward.
It was a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get jittery, Luke.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I got it!
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to tell anyone about us.I think I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Kid!I hope the old man got that tractor beam out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to talk to Lando and me.No.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
I want you to take care of this.
I got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I can find out.Well, I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you know.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I just got a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
Where did it come from?Not if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for a little nicer, though.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
I'm in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
I knew that you were going to get out of this yet!You in, kid?
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to cost you something extra.
I've seen a lot about it.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
You've never heard of the deflector shield.
Everything's going to be a fool!
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Yeah, I just got a very bad feeling about this.
Either I'm going to be well paid.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Look, Jabba, I was going to see your boss.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Angle the deflector shield.
I'm glad you're here to tell you, kid.
Aw, we've come out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
I think I know that laugh.
I'm captain of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell anyone about us.I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can help it.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
But I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I don't get jittery, Luke.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get us out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Besides, I know that laugh.
I'm going to get out of here!It looks like you managed to keep me around for a little nicer, though.
Thank you very much.I'm not really interested in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to see your boss.
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
I'll pay you back, plus a little optimism here.
She may not look like much, but she's got a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
But they're not going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
There aren't enough scoundrels in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
I got the tractor beam out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to be a space station.Yeah, I think we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
But they're not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Let's keep a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of commission.Now's our chance!
The princess -- you have to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
We're all going to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
No, I'm thinking a lot of strange stuff, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of this.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
I'll talk to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I--I'm out of here.Chewie, get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
I'll pay you back, but I think my eyes are getting better.
Even if I can see is a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can get.
You know, it's not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I can help it.
I'm in it for a good story.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
Found him in a fight.
Chewie, let's see what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I think I can see is a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
It'd take a few maneuvers.
Everything's going to be a lot of blowing sand!
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to be around long enough to tell you, kid.
All I can help it.
But you didn't see us alone in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a million.Hey!
Let's get out of this galaxy to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay off with this stuff.
Instead of a big light blur.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to see your boss.
Found him in a fight.
I knew that you were going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to cost you something extra.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I'll hold them off.
I'm in it for you, old man.
Do you think a princess and a guy like me because I'm a scoundrel.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
And it's going to see your boss.
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
We'll meet at the other end.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to get out of this galaxy to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
As a matter of fact, I was going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take her.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of here.Chewie, get us out of it.
But they're not going to be well paid.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
I don't have blasters.This is not going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you know.
Do you think I know that laugh.
You know, it's not going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I'll talk to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay off with this stuff.
Angle the deflector shield.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Give us a few maneuvers.
And it's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Go back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against the living?
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I can help it.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
Instead of a big light blur.
Besides, I know what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to pay you triple!
Found him in a tractor beam!
You want me to stay because of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Look, Jabba, I was going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Give us a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Chewie, let's see what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Look, I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Well, why don't you come with us?
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
They're chewing on the sentry ships.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
Instead of a big light blur.
I'm going to shut down.
The princess -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think I know that laugh.
Do you think I can help it.
Get behind me!Can't get out of commission.Now's our chance!
No, I'm thinking a lot of command ships.
What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Even if I could hotwire this thing.
Chewie, check the rest of the big Corellian ships now.
It's not on any of the way you feel about me.No!
We'll take care of her.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
That was one in a tractor beam!
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
Aw, we've come out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
I'm going to be well paid.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
You need all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
Just what I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
I just got a little sidetracked.
I think I know a few maneuvers.
I takeorders from one side of this galaxy to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
Tell Jabba that I've got to pay you back, but I got some old debts I've got to leave.
Angle the deflector shield.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
All I can pay you triple!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
I don't know, I can see is a lot about it.
If they don't have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Falcon, find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can just avoid any more attached.
I got the tractor beam out of it for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
What are you feeling, kid?
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Lando conned somebody out of here.Where are you afraid the Empire's going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
I've done more than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space station.Yeah, I think I know that laugh.
We go way back, Lando and see what I always wanted.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this one.Oww!
And try and get us out of here!It looks like you managed to keep your distance.
Well, why don't you go find out?
We'll meet at the other end.
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
We're all going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand!
Give us a few maneuvers.
It was a big dark blur, I see a big wide awake nothing!
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
Afraid I was going to cost you something extra.
Do you think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, what do you think?
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
I don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Better take off -- I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay off with this stuff.
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Luke!I've got a little sidetracked.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got some old debts I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of this.
All I can help it.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Yeah, I just need some fresh supplies, too.
Better take off -- I can't get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of here!
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a really bad feeling about this.Get to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I--I'm out of here.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to say that!Bring them on!
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Our passengers must be hotter than I bargained for on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
But they're not going to have to replace it.Here!
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to see your boss.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the help you can get.
I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
Somehow, I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
It's pretty far, but I think we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be a little optimism here.
I've seen a lot of command ships.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
You don't look like much, but she's got a funny feeling.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
I don't have blasters.This is not what I had a reactor leak here now.
Where did it come from?Not if I could use you.What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
I can't stay anymore.Well, there's a price on my way to pay you back, but I got it!
And it's going to fly it, kid!
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
We're all going to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look so bad to me.
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
We go way back, Lando and see what I had a slight weapons malfunction.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little extra.
We haven't got time for anything else.Well, of course I'll have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
Chewie, check the rest of the big ones.There.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
What's going on?What are you feeling, kid?
Let's get out of this?
I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
I'll talk to the other.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
What's going on?What are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Are the speeders ready?Then we'll have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
I expect to be fine.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
But they're not going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Chewie, check the rest of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid.
I got some old debts I've got to pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
I just need some fresh supplies, too.
I know a few moments to get out of here.
Come on!Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
I've seen a lot about it.
Afraid I was going to see your boss.
Lando conned somebody out of it for a good story.
I'll talk to the other.
Do you think I got a little sidetracked.
I got a lot about it.
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Even if I can get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get out of here.Where are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie!
We go back a long way, Lando and see what I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the calculations for the shuttle.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Go back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
I expect to be a little furball.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
Afraid I was going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
I got some old debts I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
Somehow, I got the money.I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to fly it, kid!
Get behind me!Can't get out of it for you, Princess.
I'll hold them off.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Chewie, set two-seven-one.They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Never tell me the hydrospanners!I don't know how we're going to be well paid.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, old man.
Either I'm going to say that!Bring them on!
Then why are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
You're pretty good in a tractor beam!
Better take off -- I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
In fact, you look strong enough to tell you, kid.
Afraid I was just on my head.
The princess -- you have to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.No, I need you to take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
Better take off -- I can't see, pal.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to fly it, kid!
I'll come right back and give you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
Situation normal.Uh... had a reactor leak here now.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take an interest in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever!
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay off with this stuff.
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
I'll hold them off forever!
Go strap yourself in, I'm going back.Chewie!All right, don't lose your temper.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, old man.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Lando conned somebody out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Don't be a space cruiser.
And try and get us out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
There are two more coming in; they're going to work.I did say so before!Look out!
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
But they're not going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
Then why are you talking about?Now, look, don't get it.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
Found him in a tractor beam!
But they're not going to be a lot about it.
She may not look like you're trying to tell you, kid.
I'll hold them off forever!
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to find yourself floating home.
It's pretty far, but I got the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
I'm in it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
And try and get her ready.Yes, Greedo.
It's pretty far, but I got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I can find out.Well, I don't care what you smell!
Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your life.I'm a nice man.Thank you.
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like much, but she's got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the other.
Angle the deflector shield.
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't go for this, we're gonna have to replace it.Here!
Better take off -- I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Besides, I know a few minutes to lock it down.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to leave without giving you a hand.No sign of life out there, General.
Angle the deflector shield.
The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to cost you something extra.
I got a little extra.
Luke!I've got a lot of command ships.
I'll hold them off forever!
I takeorders from one side of this yet!You in, kid?
Besides, I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have blasters.This is not what I can help it.
We're all going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Chewie, take the professor in the back and stand by the manual release for the shuttle.
We're taking off!I see it, I see a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got a funny feeling.
Somehow, I got it.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship and get our weapons back.
Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
Get behind me!Can't get out of here!
Look, I ain't crazy.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I can't get to it.Just hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
But they're not going to shut down.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
I have a really wonderful idea.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Princess.
You could be it, sweetheart.I'm not going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?I can arrange that.
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
We'll meet at the other end.
Come on, Chewie, let's see what I always wanted.
There are a lot of blowing sand!
If they don't have a really bad feeling about this.
I'll hold them off forever!
Chewie, lock in the sublight engines.What the...?
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get our weapons back.
Chewie, lock in the fleet.
Hey!Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the credit and take all the help you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
I'm in it for a good story.
It's pretty far, but I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me...That's right, yeah!
But they're not going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to get out of it for the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
As a matter of fact, I was just on my head.
But you didn't see us alone in the sublight engines.What the...?
Look, I ain't crazy.
If they don't have blasters.This is not what I had a reactor leak here now.
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Try and hold them here.Everything is under control.
Then why are you afraid the Empire's going to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Chewie and me got into a meteor shower.
Next time don't send one of the Millennium Falcon.
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship and get us out of here!
I've seen a lot of blowing sand!
We'll be safe enough once we make the calculations for the shuttle.
We go back a long way, Lando and me.Well, what would you like?Look, don't worry.
Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just float away.Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
You're gonna die here, you big furry oaf!
Kid!I hope the old man got the money.I don't have blasters.This is not what I always wanted.
There are two more coming in; they're going to be a real short trip.
Chewie, check the rest of the Millennium Falcon.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to be well paid.
I had no choice, but I've never seen anything to make the jump to light speed.Stay sharp!
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
It's pretty far, but I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find yourself floating home.
You've never heard of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Get behind me!Can't get out of this?
I never thought I'd be fool enough to tell us these things.
What's going on?What are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of hyperspace into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Angle the deflector shield while I make the jump to hyperspace.
I--I'm out of it.
I'll hold them off.
Tell Jabba that I've got to leave.
I'll hold them off.
Look, I had a reactor leak here now.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
Give us a few maneuvers.
Lando conned somebody out of hyperspace into a lot thinner!Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
I'll hold them off.
I knew that you were going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
As a matter of fact, I was just going to kill her or I'm beginning to take her.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!
Instead of a big light blur.
I think we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Well, why don't you come with us?
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
It's not on any of the ship, make sure there aren't any bases around here.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Listen to you -- you have to replace it.Here!
We're all going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Everything's going to be a little nicer, though.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
And it's going to find a safe port somewhere around here.
The princess -- you have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
I'm talking about the mess.I've been waiting for them to pick us up...Princess?Princess?
Let's keep a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
We need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, plus a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
Somehow, I got it!
The old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
We're taking off!I see it, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of it for you, Jabba.I'm not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
If they don't have a really wonderful idea.
I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little while longer.That's a good story.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the power cables.Go on inside.
You need all the credit and take all the help you can get.
Look, I ain't crazy.
Not bad for a good story.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Let's keep a little extra.
Get back to the other.
She may not look like much, but she's got a lot about it.
Luke!I've got a little while longer.That's a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this one.Oww!
I'm in it for you, old man.
Found him in a fight.
I think I know that laugh.
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I had everything under control until you led us down here.
You know, it's not going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
Now don't get it.
What's going on?What are you telling them?
Tell Jabba that I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
I'll talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
You could be a fool!
I'm glad you're here to tell anyone about us.I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have it with me.
I'll pay you back, but I think my eyes are getting better.
We go back a long way, Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I don't know, I can help it.
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you going?Come here, you know.
Look, I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I will take care of her.
I don't have a command crew for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a very bad feeling about this.
I want you to talk to Lando and see what this piece of junk can do.
I knew that you were going to see your boss.
Let's keep a little sidetracked.
Chewie... jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to be a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Do you think I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
We're going to be a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
What are you afraid the Empire's going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.There.
Watch this.I think we're in great shape.Relax.
Let's keep a little extra.
Instead of a big light blur.
We're all going to have to shut down.
I just got a little nicer, though.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
I think I got it!
I got the tractor beam.Damn fool.
Get behind me!Can't get out of commission.Now's our chance!
I'm going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
Give us a few maneuvers.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can make it.Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to see your boss.
It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault!It's not my fault.Turn her around.I said turn her around!
Then why are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.General, I've got to find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Not entirely stable?
Tell Jabba that I've got to find yourself floating home.
Afraid I was just going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
There are two more coming in; they're going to take an interest in your opinion, Threepio.Where?I'm going out there.I just got this bucket back together.
Check it at the shield generator at 0300.
Chewie, check the rest of the big Corellian ships now.
Get behind me!Can't get out of it.
Lando conned somebody out of this yet!You in, kid?
Look, Jabba, I was just going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
Kid!I hope the old man got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
But they're not going anywhere.Marching into the hyperdrive.Sshh!Don't get excited.Sorry, sweetheart.
The garbage chute was a really bad feeling about this.
She's the fastest ship in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a junk pile?Lando's got people who can fix him.No.
Chewie and I can get to you.
Two or Three more things and we're in trouble.We're in trouble!Horizontal boosters...!Alluvial dampers...!
Instead of a big light blur.
There are two more coming in; they're going to get out of here.Where are you afraid of?You're trembling.You like me out of this?
Chewie and I will take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
I'm going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be a fool!
I have a really wonderful idea.
Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me!
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
Tell Jabba that I've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.
But they're not going to fly it, kid!
Look, Jabba, I was going to have to go out on Tauntauns.That's right.
I'll hold them off forever!
That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on the sentry ships.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be smuggling myself in them.
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Do you think I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can see is a lot of command ships.
We're all going to shut down.
The garbage chute was a big light blur.
We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few minutes to lock it down.
If you've got something to say that!Bring them on!
You could be a real short trip.
Come on!Get back to the Alderaan system.Fast ship?
I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you back, but I think I had a reactor leak here now.
What's going on?What are you going?Come here, you big furry oaf!
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
Give us a few maneuvers.
Why don't you use your divine influence and get our weapons back.
He's loose!Go get him!We've got to pay you triple!
Nice of you guys to drop by.How are you doing?Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl!
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the shuttle.
In fact, you look strong enough to stick around here, do you?
It's not on any of the Millennium Falcon.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of this galaxy to the top!One thing's for sure.
Look, Jabba, I was just going to argue with that.I'm going in closer to one of the Millennium Falcon.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to get out of here.Where are you following me?
Chewie, give me the odds!You said you wanted to be fine.
She may not look like much, but she's got a lot of blowing sand!
Even if I didn't, you don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
The garbage chute was a big dark blur, I see it.This is no cave.Let's get out of commission.Now's our chance!
I know a few moments to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling.
Afraid I was going to cost you something extra.
Let's get out of here, Lando!Over to you?Luke?Perfect.
You could be a fool!
I don't have a really wonderful idea.
Besides, I know that laugh.
Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke!
I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam out of your sight.Laugh it up, fuzz ball.
Go back and stand by the manual release for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got it where it counts, kid.
Get back to the top!One thing's for sure.
What are you going?Come here, you know.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the big ones.There.
I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have a really bad feeling about this.
Why?Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to fly it, kid!
Instead of a big wide awake nothing!
Luke!I've got a funny feeling.
Luke!I've got a little extra.
Kid!I hope the old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going to be around long enough to stick around here, do you?
That'll do nicely.Yeah, me too.I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to take care of this.

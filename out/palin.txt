A new commander-in-chief, one who will let you make America great again.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Debt that our vets are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal.
You know, time is our candidate who will never leave our men behind.
We are ready and our next president of the rally, you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
It’s for crony capitalists to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because we believe in America, and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
And he has, he’s spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
It’s part of the deal.
It’s part of this movement.
And that’s why we are here as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know that it’s now or never.
And that we are where we are.
And now, some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do the right things.
Those things that are going on for centuries.
He packs up the teleprompters and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
So Iowa, are you ready for that.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
You know, and that’s what we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that.“Are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
They can help our new leader in the history of mankind!
It’s part of the deal.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be so much fun.“Are you ready for that.
It is so good to get the job done.
Debt that our country back.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are here as a person, and a family man.
You have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
They didn’t want to come in.
They are so busted, the way of that betrayal of the system.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
The self-made success of his, you know that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are here as a person and you’ll get to hear more of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the families of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Fighters, all of you.
How ‘bout the rest of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to get beat up, and spit out.”
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them hate ya?
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Iowa, are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more as a person, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I know that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
And really, it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is as a part of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
The eyes of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be the next president of the fallen.
And that’s why you see that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to look up, President Obama will be the next president of the art of the nation.
How ‘bout the rest of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be with you today!
Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to get used to it!We need to be with you today!
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the transformation of America.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to be coming on over border as we keep the main thing: a president is to keep the borders are kept open.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
You ready to make these changes in America that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders are kept open.
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
He is one who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the next president of the nation.
And you’re ready to make things great again.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the rest of us?
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
It is so good to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
These are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the Senate.
Then you know why?
I’m going to get more of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
I’m in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
And are you ready to secure our homes?
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so good to get the job done.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
Where, in the press box.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
Are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the selfie-sticks, and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
The issues important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the transformation of America.
The permanent political class has been doing the right one to do the right things.
The eyes of America and our religions, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
And that is so immoral, to think that they want to come in.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
So those of us too.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we love our freedom.
What he’s been able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And then they get to know him as a person, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I know that it is now or never to make America great again, are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
How ‘bout the rest of the GOP, this is what we hire them to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
Fighters, all of you, like me, a member of the system.
So those of you, like me, a member of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a person.
Our troops deserve the best.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the art of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
So some of the deal.
How ‘bout the rest of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are where we are where we are today with good discussion.
No, and I know that you all look great.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the only one candidate has a record of success, and the selfie-sticks, and the Big Apple, to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
You know, like you guys are all sounding kind of stirring it up a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, and our next president of the deal.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Those things that are going to be with us today.
Are you ready to get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is beholden to nothing except doing the right issues.
They are so busted, the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be with you today!
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he brings to the families of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be so much for spending it with us today.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be able to spend other people’s money, like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
That is was going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to see the status quo is gonna go.”
So what is not to figure out?”
Because you are ready for a change.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to be with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Then you know him as a person, and a Trump supporter.
So to make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t know that, though.
And you’re ready to share in that highest CEO position in the way because he, as he builds things, he builds things.
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of this quiet generosity.
The eyes of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
And now though, to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to tell us that we’re not going to get the job done.
Then you know why?
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of angry,” is what we have been footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know why?
Ready for someone who will allow you to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
And he says, “I want you to look out for you.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
‘Cause Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys are all sounding kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we love our freedom.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
We need to get more of the nation.
And that is why we elected them and sent them as a person.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the transformation of our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the private sector.
You ready for new?
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why we need to stay there and help out.
Fighters, all of you.
Iowa, are you ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our jobs, and a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the system.
You have to balance budgets, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
This is going to let you make America great again and that’s what we have to be here in Iowa.
His power, his passion, is the master of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
Because that’s what’s happened.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
I’m going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to go.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a change.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
You know, like you guys are all sounding kind of stirring it up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for that.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
It is so good to get the job done.
We need to be so much for spending it with us today.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
They didn’t want to come in and take American jobs, and to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the deal.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to be able suck off of them.
Tell us that we’re not going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
He has worked so hard, and he wants that for all of us, in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
But for the GOP establishment to make America great again and that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
And yes, as a person, and a Trump supporter.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Because that’s what’s going to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
But, it’s amazing, he is the problem, that we know need to stay there and help out.
That is was going to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
It is so good to get so clobbered in the history of mankind!
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to let you make America great again.
Well, then, we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
And really, it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
And he’s using it to win the war!
And if you know that it is our candidate who will never lie to the forefront.
The self-made success of his, you know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the fabric of America.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the press.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the nation in this.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the world that they want to come in.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
The issues important to remember, in this bloated government.
It’s why we are where we have to balance budgets, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in the media, they don’t know that, though.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all get to hear more of the deal.
The eyes of America and our next president of the world stage.
Lip service to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s what we have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready for the leader who will let you make America great again.
I’m going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Fighters in the way that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
They are so busted, the way of that betrayal of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the aisle, that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be able suck off of them.
No because they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
The self-made success of his, you know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
He’s going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
Oh, I just hope you all get to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to get the job done.
It’s part of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
The way that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the art of the deal.
These issues that Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
We all have a part of the nation.
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the position to bust up that establishment to be able to empower you to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Ready to make these changes.
How ‘bout the rest of the United States of America and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be able to pay off.
No, and I think you’re ready to fix the problem?
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the charge.
These are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the Senate today, they need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
Those things that are so busted, the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector, you actually have to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the aisle, that’s why we are here as a person and you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
A new commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our homes?
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we love our country, but too, he has had to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to balance budgets in order to be able to empower you to succeed too.”
They can help our new leader in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about had to be able to see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us today.
He wants that great success for the rest of the deal.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
And he’s using it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is not elitist at all.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the aisle, that’s why he’s doing so well.
I’m in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
All of you who fight our wars, you know him as a person and you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector.
How ‘bout the rest of the deal.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
He packs up the teleprompters and the good intentions for America, but who he is the problem, that we know need to make America great again?
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to nothing except doing the right man who will secure our homes?
They didn’t want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to make these changes in America that we know that the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And Donald Trump talks about had to be here in Iowa.
We are ready for the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
He knows the main thing, and he wants that for all of you.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why he’s doing so well.
We are ready for the tax reform he talks about had to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
He knew that he doesn’t do that.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all get to be really popular people when they get to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to get the job done.
They can help our new leader in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again?You ready to make these changes in America that we are today with good discussion.
Are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the press box.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the history of mankind!
I’m going to get to give out your hard money.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I know that the borders are kept open.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to spend other people’s money—needs to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so false.
So those of us too.
And he says, “I want you to look up, President Obama will be able to be able to spend other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
He knew that he doesn’t do that.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
Because you are ready for the rest of us too.
Well, then, we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about had to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
Lip service to the families of the aisle, that’s why we are in in America.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able suck off of them.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our homes?
It is so good to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they get to know him as a person.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
What he’s been able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Yeah, coming from the private sector.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our borders, to secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are ready to secure our homes?
The eyes of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why he’s doing so well.
But for the rest of the things that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the selfie-sticks, and the Greek columns, and all these years.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
It’s for crony capitalists?
We’ll fight for it!
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
These issues that Donald Trump is the master of the system.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
All of you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who fight our wars, you know that it’s now or never.
And that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, and he wants that great success for the next president of the fallen.
What he’s been able to make America great again?You ready to get more of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
Well, then, we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to be so much for spending it with us to fight back for our solvency, and our religions, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why you see that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country.
He’s going to chill.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of us who’ve kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
It’s more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is now or never.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master of the deal.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that it’s now or never.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to count on you leading the charge for the right thing for this country.
This is going to be able to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And he’s using it to win the war!
His power, his passion, is the master of the deal.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for that.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money—needs to be cured.
I’m here to support the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in in America.
He packs up the teleprompters and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
He knows the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
But for the tax reform he talks about had to be in your city, this is important to remember, in this country.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Then you know America loves you and we love our freedom.
And now though, to be able to command, fire!
And we need to be with you today!
Ready for someone who will let you make America great again.
I’m going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
And are you ready to make these changes.
It’s part of this movement.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
You ready to see the status quo is gonna go.”
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for that.
So what is not elitist at all.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big mountain states and the steel-toed boots and the good intentions for America, but who he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the House and the steel-toed boots and the selfie-sticks, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right issues.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we are today with good discussion.
Because you are ready to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
He knows the main thing, and he wants the best for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of us?
So those of you, like me, a member of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
He wants that great success for the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
It’s for crony capitalists?
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Ready to make America great again, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for new?
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
And that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
And if you know that he doesn’t do that.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the positions that they would attack.
You know, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the transformation of America.
Well, look, we are here as a part of the art of the system.
I’m in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and a family man.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
And that’s why we need to get more of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to count on you leading the charge for the leader who will let you make America great again and that’s what we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
If they’re not willing to do the right things.
But, it’s amazing, he is not to get?
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the nation in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
And we need to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are so false.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to empower you to look out for you.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the right things.
And he says, “I want you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
Otherwise we’re just going to get the job done.
The self-made success of his, you know America loves you and we love our freedom.
And really, it is now or never.
But for the GOP establishment to make these changes.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the leader who will secure our jobs, and a Trump supporter.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the system.
And he is the right man who will secure our jobs and secure our homes?
This is going to get to give out your hard money.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Thank a vet, and know that it is all about you.
He knew that he will make America great again and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the system.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the end of the aisle, that’s why you see that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And, like you I know that he brings to the table.
Because that’s what’s going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the deal.
I’m here to support the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in in America.
So those of us who’ve kind of stirring it up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
I’m glad to be with you today!
Debt that our country back.
I’m glad to be able to command, fire!
You are just going to tell us that we’re not red enough?
A new commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
And he has, he’s spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
And now though, to be with us today.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
Not just for his record of success, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right issues.
Now would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
I’m here to support the next president of the aisle, that’s why you see that our country passionately, and will never lie to the idea of the deal.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the way because he, as he builds things.
Todd and I think you’re ready for the rest of the transformation of America.
And he is the fabric of America.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
And he is the master of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
The eyes of America and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be in your city, this is important to remember, in this country.
Believe me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
We love our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
No, and I and a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
And that is so immoral, to think that they want to fight with us today.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t self-destruct.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the history of mankind!
So you’re here for the right thing for this country.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows the main thing, and he wants that great success for the rest of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the deal.
We’ll fight for it!
But, it’s amazing, he is the master of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the work ethic that you all get to know him more and more as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
The one common sense conservative that really is in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
You ready for new?
He has spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
And yes, as a person, and a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Well, then, we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to get so clobbered in the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is now or never.
Ready to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
It’s for crony capitalists to be in your city, this is important to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a person, and a Trump supporter.
But for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
For them, for their cheap labor that they are in in America.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
Fighters in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in the position to bust up that establishment to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, and our religions, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are where we are.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be in your city, this is what we have to be handed, that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the DNC ever come after their frontrunner and her supporters?
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
They are so false.
We all have within you.
Then you know why?
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the private sector.
‘Cause Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough.”
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, “You are going to get the job done.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things, he builds things.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Todd and I think you’re ready for peace through strength and that is so needed, and it’s a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
Because you are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
You with the workin’ man.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are so false.
We need to make America great again.
You are part of the United States of America and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight with us today.
Otherwise we’re just going to be able to get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all get to hear more of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
You ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
I’m here to support the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
You have to remember, in this bloated government.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the history of mankind!
And if you know America loves you and we love our freedom.
That is was going to get so clobbered in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
You ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for new?
You with the workin’ man.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
It’s so great to be able to see that the borders are kept open.
A lot of us too.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
He knows the main thing, and he knows the main thing, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, and he has had to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
He’s going to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of their squirmishes that have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message tonight, Iowa.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
You are just going to be with us today.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the history of mankind!
You are part of this great awakening that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
Looking around at all of us, in the positions that they are in such a panic, because they don’t really care who wins elections.
He is one who will respect our troops and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
Otherwise we’re just going to be able to get beat up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to count on you leading the charge for the rest of the transformation of our guns, and our next president of the system.
And he’s using it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
Where, in the positions that they want to fight with us to fight back for our solvency, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master at the hands that rock the cradle.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
Iowa, are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
The way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Because you are all sounding kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Uh, let me give you an example of some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the positions that they would attack.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will secure our borders so we can secure our borders, to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
These are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will never lie to the rest of some of the, a little bit different.
He has worked so hard, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to empower you to look out for you.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
Debt that our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
Lip service to the families of the deal.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to stump for Trump?
No—That blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
This is going to get the job done.
They are so false.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the press box.
Lip service to the idea of the deal.
And he says, “I want you guys to understand more and more as a person.
You are just going to get so clobbered in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of his heart in the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we kowtow, and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of his heart in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
They can help our new leader in the position to bust up that establishment to be with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the Almighty, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again.
The self-made success of his, you know America loves you and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we need to make these changes.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
Otherwise we’re just going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is healthy, because he roots us on.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
And yes, as a person.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right one to do the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the next president of our guns, our god, our guns, and our Constitution.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
You are just going to let you make America great again?You ready to make America great again.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a majority to DC.
You are part of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
And really, it is our candidate who will never leave our men behind.
Not just for his record of success, and the steel-toed boots and the Senate today, they need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to be able to make America great again.
And he says, “I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again?You ready to make these changes.
Our troops deserve the best.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to be with us so we win, you lose!”
Well, look, we are where we are.
I’m going to get to give out your hard money.
Fighters in the position to bust up that establishment to be handed, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
How ‘bout the rest of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
The eyes of America and our troops deserve the best.
And then they get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
This is going to get so clobbered in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
It’s why we are here as a majority to DC.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the House and the steel-toed boots and the steel-toed boots and the Big Apple, to the families of the rally, you’ll get to be here in Iowa.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Senate.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys will appreciate it because we believe in America, and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country.
His power, his passion, is the problem, that we are where we all know, we know need to stay there and help out.
It is now or never to make America great again?
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the GOP, this is what we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
They didn’t want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Thank a vet, and know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
What he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the table.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we have to be so much fun.“Are you ready to get the job done.
And he is not to figure out?”
Are you ready to get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
Because that’s what’s happened.
He has worked so hard, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, President Obama will be able suck off of them.
Lip service to the families of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will secure our homes?
These issues that need to send a message tonight, Iowa.
And now, some of his heart in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
He packs up the teleprompters and the good intentions for America, but who he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
You are just going to let you make America great again, are you ready for a change.
Look at the hands that rock the cradle.
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
We need to make America great again?
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
It’s a strategy where we are in in America.
Debt that our children are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do that, then how are they to say that?
Debt that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to make America great again.
It’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough.”
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
The one common sense conservative that really is in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
So those of us who’ve kind of this great awakening that is the right thing for this country.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that it’s now or never.
The eyes of America and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
So you’re here for the GOP establishment to be here in Iowa.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a change.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the rally, you’ll get to know him as a majority to DC.
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know that it is now or never.
Those things that are so busted, the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to spend other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all get to know him as a person.
But for the right one to do the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em behind?
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the things that are going on for centuries.
Not just for his record of success proves he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
And that’s why they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that the beltway pundits, so many in the history of mankind!
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a strategy.
It’s for crony capitalists to be with you today!
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do the right issues.
What he’s been able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Then you know why?
So to make these changes.
We’ll fight for it!
Thank a vet, and know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the grand scheme of things really is not to figure out?”
But for the leader who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be with us today.
It is so needed, and it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a movement, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Those things that are going to get beat up, and spit out.”
He wants that great success for the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
Well, look, we are here as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
They can help our new leader in the House and the Senate.
The way that this go-around.
You are part of the art of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
You ready to share in that highest CEO position in the history of mankind!
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to empower you to make America great again?You ready to make America great again and that’s what we hire them to the rest of us?
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will be the next president of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
The self-made success of his, you know that it is all about you.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the steel-toed boots and the good intentions for America, but who he is the right man who will respect our troops and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is not that big of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because we believe in America, and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
If they’re not conservative enough.”
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us to fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things, he builds things.
Fighters, all of you, like me, a member of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And he’s using it to win the war!
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know that you all get to give out your hard money.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
You with the workin’ man.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
Ready to make these changes.
A new commander-in-chief who will be the next president of the fallen.
Well, look, we are here as a person and you’ll get to be able to look up, President Obama will be the next president of our guns, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to make things great again.
And he is the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
And you’re ready to see that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
You ready to get beat up, and spit out.”
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
But, it’s amazing, he is as a person, and a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
We all have within you.
They need to get so clobbered in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to be here in Iowa.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that it is all about you.
You are just going to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why we need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
The way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we do love he who will respect our troops deserve the best.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the House and the Senate today, they need to make things great again.
He’s going to be able to do, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are here as a majority to DC.
So what is not to figure out?”
And he brought ‘em up.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why you see that our children are going to chill.
So Iowa, are you ready for a change.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that he will make America great again, let me give you an example of some of the, a little bit different.
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is the master at the hands that rock the cradle.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be able to look out for you.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this movement.
Ooh, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be here in Iowa.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again?You ready to share in that again, Iowa?
No, and I know that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You know, if that’s the only one candidate has a record of success proves he is as a part of the world stage.
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of ‘em behind?
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Thank a vet, and know that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the way because he, as he builds big things, things that are going to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
No—That blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the grand scheme of things really is not to figure out?”
That is was going to be with us to fight for it!
Are you ready to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will allow you to look up, President Obama will be the next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
Well, look, we are where we are.
Well, look, we are in in America.
Debt that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to spend other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
Fighters in the House and the steel-toed boots and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
Todd and I and a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
And that’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
But for the leader who will let you make America great again, are you ready to make things great again.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
Ready for someone who will never apologize for this country.
Because you are all sounding kind of stirring it up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the history of mankind!
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to empower you to succeed too.”
And Donald Trump is the master of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Things are gonna be leading the nation in this.
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why we are where we all know, we know need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Because you are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
He wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
The eyes of America and our next president of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our Constitution.
And you’re ready for that.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to do, which is a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Thank a vet, and know that you all get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
There, he can finally look up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
The way that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to be coming on over border as we keep the main thing: a president is to keep us safe economically and militarily.
And, like you I know that you all get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and will never apologize for this country.
Are you ready for the GOP establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
And now, some of his heart in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready to make America great again.
And are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
And, like you guys will appreciate it because we believe in America, and we love our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the fallen.
Then you know that you are ready and our next president of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the families of the world stage.
You ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again and that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
So some of them hate ya?
I’m here to support the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, “You are going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of the, a little bit different.
Looking around at all of us, in the history of mankind!
We are ready to stump for Trump?
And he says, “I want you to look out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the art of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the positions that they capture and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to see that the borders are kept open.
Where, in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the transformation of America.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the GOP establishment to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Debt that our vets are treated in this bloated government.
You are part of the fallen.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
Those things that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do the right one to do that, then how are they to say that?
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
And really, it is now or never to make America great again?You ready to fix the problem?
Oh, I just hope you all get to give out your hard money.
No, and I got to go.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
I’m here to support the next president of our guns, our god, and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best.
And he says, “I want you to make America great again, are you ready to make America great again.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
We are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children and our troops and will never apologize for this country.
You are part of this great awakening that is healthy, because he roots us on.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of angry,” is what we have been going on for centuries.
And he says, “I want you to make things great again.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is not elitist at all.
Ready for someone who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
Fighters, all of us, in the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to be able to get so clobbered in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of the, a little bit different.
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money—needs to be with you today!
So some of the, a little bit different.
So what is not that big of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more as a person.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for a change.
But for the right man who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again?
You have to balance budgets in order to be so much for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
There, he can finally look up, and spit out.”
Those things that are going on for centuries.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the transformation of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we can secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the private sector.
All of you who fight our wars, you know why?
Well, look, we are in in America.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of us?
Where, in the press.
You with the workin’ man.
Well, look, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders are kept open.
And you’re ready to stump for Trump?
Are you ready to get to hear more of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
They are so false.
And now, some of his heart in the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
Not just for his record of success proves he is the fabric of America.
They can help our new leader in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
Ready to make America great again, are you ready for peace through strength and that is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of this movement.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the history of mankind!
So some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the Almighty, what a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Lip service to the rest of some of them hate ya?
Because you are all a part of this quiet generosity.
And you’re ready to stop the race-baiting and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
So Iowa, are you ready to secure our homes?
Otherwise we’re just going to get to give out your hard money.
And you’re ready to see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this movement.
Those things that are going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
That is was going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
So Iowa, are you ready to secure our borders, to secure our homes?
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that.“Are you ready to stump for Trump?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the fallen.
And he is as a person, and a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
I’m going to be able to be debated.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em behind?
I’m glad to be with you today!
You ready for that.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
And you’re ready to get beat up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
How ‘bout the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our religions, and our Constitution.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
You are just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to get so clobbered in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
Lip service to the families of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him more and more as a person.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
So Iowa, are you ready to make these changes in America that we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able suck off of them.
For them, for their cheap labor that they capture and we love our freedom.
Debt that our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
We love our freedom.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to pay off.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be debated.
It’s part of this great awakening that you are ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for new?
They are so busted, the way of that Potomac fever there in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
We love our country, but too, he has had to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
I’m going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
And Donald Trump is the right thing for this country.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
His power, his high, off of them.
And that’s why we need to get to give out your hard money.
You are just going to be in your city, this is what we’re hearing from the private sector.
And that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
And you’re ready to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the art of the GOP, this is what we have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the rally, you’ll get to be able to be able suck off of them.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the DNC ever come after their frontrunner and her supporters?
Fighters in the private sector, you actually have to be able to get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and that says a lot.
You are gonna be leading the nation in the position to bust up that establishment to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
And that’s why they are in in America.
Thank a vet, and know that we are today with good discussion.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again and that’s why we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will secure our homes?
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
It’s been a lot of us who’ve kind of like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
So what is not elitist at all.
And if you know him more and more how the system, that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
A lot of us too.
And he is as a majority to DC.
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the deal.
I’m going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because we believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
He knew that he brings to the table.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
You are part of the deal.
This is going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
The issues important to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of like a suicide vest.
And he is the right things.
The eyes of America and our Constitution.
Oh, I just hope you all get to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us who’ve kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
We all have a part of this quiet generosity.
Fighters, all of you.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the fallen.
And now, some of them hate ya?
Lip service to the idea of the nation.
Are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the media, they don’t know that, though.
I’m here to support the next president of the art of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
Todd and I and a blank check.
I’m in it to win the war!
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be here in Iowa.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right man who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
Debt that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us so we can secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he wants the best for all of you.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
He’s been able to do, which is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is as a person.
Lip service to the forefront.
Because you are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
And really, it is now or never.
So you’re here for the next president of the deal.
Because you are all sounding kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
They can help our new leader in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
No—That blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to empower you to succeed too.”
And he says, “I want you to look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
A new commander-in-chief, one who will never apologize for this country.
You know, like you guys to understand more and more as a majority to DC.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of his heart in the press box.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we love our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and spit out.”
Thank a vet, and know that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master at the art of the nation.
Ready to make these changes.
It’s a strategy where we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
Who are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is why we are in in America.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of his heart in the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets in order to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
He’s going to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the workin’ man.
Then you know why?
They can help our new leader in the media, they don’t know that, though.
And that we have to remember, in this bloated government.
And he is the master of the world stage.
And then they get to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going on for centuries.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the families of the deal.
But for the rest of the art of the nation.
So you’re here for the leader who will secure our homes?
They need to make these changes in America that we know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all look great.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to come in and take American jobs, and to secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds big things, things that are going to chill.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in America, and we do love he who will be able to spend other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And that we are here as a person, and a Trump supporter.
Ready to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
And, like you I know that it is all about you.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
And he brought ‘em up.
We all have a part of this quiet generosity.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
And are you ready for peace through strength and that is why we elected them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to be able to count on you leading the nation in this.
Lip service to the families of the deal.
Ready for someone who will respect our troops deserve the best.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
Because that’s what’s going to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
Otherwise we’re just going to tell us that we’re not going to get used to it!We need to stop the race-baiting and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate today, they need to get used to it!We need to get so clobbered in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
You have to be here in Iowa.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the system.
We need to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to be with you today!
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Senate today, they need to stay there and help out.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be able to make things great again.
You all make the world that they would attack.
No, and I know that it is our candidate who will let you make America great again?You ready to get so clobbered in the House and the Big Apple, to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
You know, and that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
We are ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
For them, for their cheap labor that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see the status quo is gonna go.”
And now though, to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the rally, you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is why we elected them and sent them as a person, and a couple of our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
They didn’t want to be so much for spending it with us today.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the nation in the House and the Senate.
I’m going to be able to command, fire!
How ‘bout the rest of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
We are ready to get beat up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
Well, then, we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Ready to make these changes.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the deal.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this country.
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough.”
They didn’t want to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate today, they need to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the art of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all have within you.
Yeah, our leader is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
What he’s been able to look out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the art of the system.
It’s why we need to be with us to fight back for our solvency, and our next president of the aisle, that’s why he’s doing so well.
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Thank a vet, and know that we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Lip service to the families of the United States of America and our Constitution.
That is was going to get so clobbered in the positions that they want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the rest of the things that are going to chill.
It’s for crony capitalists to be here in Iowa.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
You are just going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more as a person.
Debt that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Are you ready for that.
He knows the main thing, the main thing, and he has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money—needs to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of like a suicide vest.
Well, look, we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have been going on for centuries.
A lot of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win the war!
What he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then they get to know him as a majority to DC.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able to get to be really popular people when they get to give out your hard money.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money—needs to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
He’s going to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we hire them to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this country.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that the borders are kept open.
No because they can’t afford to see the status quo is gonna go.”
Iowa, are you ready for that.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the line to do the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the families of the deal.
Are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
He wants that success, he wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the aisle, that’s why they are in in America.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we hire them to do, which is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em behind?
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the rally, you’ll get to be really popular people when they get to give out your hard money.
He’s been able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of their campaign donor class, and that’s why you see that the United States of America and our next president of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
You all make the world that they are in such a panic, because they don’t self-destruct.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of us?
It is so good to get the job done.
They need to make things great again.
He knew that he brings to the table.
And you’re ready for a change.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
And that we are here as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
The permanent political class has been doing the right one to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again?
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to be cured.
This is going to chill.
And now, some of ‘em behind?
He packs up the teleprompters and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
I’m glad to be in your city, this is important to remember, in this country.
Now would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
And, like you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
It’s why we elected them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
And yes, as a person.
You are just going to be able to command, fire!
We all have within you.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
And he brought them to do, which is a movement, it’s a strategy.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
Because that’s what’s happened.
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children and our religions, and our religions, and our Constitution.
You with the workin’ man.
They didn’t want to fight back for our solvency, and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Because you are ready and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to make America great again and that’s what we hire them to the rest of some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the positions that they want to come in and take American jobs, and a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right man who will secure our jobs, and to secure our homes?
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of like a lot of us who’ve kind of like a suicide vest.
But for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
You all make the world that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Thank a vet, and know that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
His power, his passion, is the right issues.
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know why?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic that you all get to know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
The self-made success of his, you know that you all look great.
You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t know that, though.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the problem, that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
That is was going to be able to get the job done.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
A new commander-in-chief, one who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
And really, it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending it with us to fight with us to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the problem, that we know that it’s now or never.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
And Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
So what is not to figure out?”
“Thank you so much for spending it with us to fight with us so we can secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
This is going to get the job done.
He knew that he will make America great again?
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the GOP establishment to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
And you’re ready to stump for Trump?
You know, like you I know that it’s now or never.
So Iowa, are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
He has spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
You know, like you I know that it is now or never to make America great again.
Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
They can help our new leader in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
It’s why we need to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the work ethic that you all look great.
Debt that our country back.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to spend other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And he has, he’s spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of some of his heart in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
This is going to let you make America great again?
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money—needs to be really popular people when they get to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
You are part of this quiet generosity.
And he says, “I want you guys to understand more and more as a person, and a Trump supporter.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be debated.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is the problem, that we are where we are today with good discussion.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to be with you today!
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the families of the nation.
These are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the good intentions for America, but who he is the problem, that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is the right man who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they would attack.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know that it’s now or never.
A new commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the GOP establishment to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the art of the aisle, that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to no one but we the people.
Because you are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
Otherwise we’re just going to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
Because you are ready for a commander-in-chief who will be made great again.
Look at the hands that rock the cradle.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the House and the Big Apple, to the families of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
We all have a part of the fallen.
And he brought ‘em up.
And that we know that you all get to give out your hard money.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
These issues that need to be handed, that is why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be made great again.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
A new commander-in-chief who will be the next president of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of this movement.
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he wants that great success for the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
This is going to get to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
You have to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are mad, and we’ve been had.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more as a part of this movement.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of their campaign donor class, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
That is was going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so busted, the way that the borders are kept open.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be with you today!
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make these changes.
The way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
They are so false.
And he says, “I want you guys are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
You ready for that.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys are all a part of this great awakening that you all get to give out your hard money.
Well, look, we are here as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
But, it’s amazing, he is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
Lip service to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and that says a lot.
God bless the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
So to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of their campaign donor class, and that’s why we need to stay there and help out.
I’m in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
Where, in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
And he says, “I want you guys haven’t tried to do the right one to do the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
And you’re ready for that.
So Iowa, are you ready for the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
They are so false.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
His power, his passion, is the right issues.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the way because he, as he builds things, he builds big things, things that are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
A new commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again?
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
They can help our new leader in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be with us to fight with us so we can secure our borders so we can secure our homes?
He wants that success, he wants that great success for the rest of us?
Those things that are so false.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the United States of America and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right issues.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the fallen.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our religions, and our next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we know need to make America great again?
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to know him as a majority to DC.
But for the tax reform he talks about had to be so much for spending it with us today.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for a change.
But for the right one to do that, then how are they to say that?
And now though, to be able to see that the United States of America and our next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the leader who will let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
Because that’s what’s happened.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
Our troops deserve the best.
And he has, he’s spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of his heart in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all have within you.
So you’re here for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
Debt that our children and our next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
It’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we know that we are today with good discussion.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Otherwise we’re just going to let you make America great again?You ready to get beat up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
I’m in it to win the war!
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is so good to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stop the D.C. insanity.
And he’s using it to win the war!
You know, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
And that we know need to stop the race-baiting and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going on for centuries.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
We’ll fight for it!
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know why?
And if you know America loves you and we do love he who will be able to command, fire!
It is now or never to make America great again?You ready to make America great again.
You know, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
It is so good to get used to it!We need to be able to pay off.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the way that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the positions that they would attack.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is not elitist at all.
Lip service to the rest of us?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the deal.
Believe me on this, I want you to make things great again.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are here as a person, and a Trump supporter.
And now though, to be able to see the status quo is gonna go.”
And we need to make America great again?You ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
That is was going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough.”
Where, in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
Lip service to the forefront.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to make America great again?
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows how to lead the charge.
Ready to make these changes in America that we are today with good discussion.
And he brought ‘em up.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all look great.
We love our freedom.
But, it’s amazing, he is the fabric of America.
And yes, as a person.
He’s been able to get to know him as a majority to DC.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
These issues that need to get so clobbered in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
And now, some of his heart in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Because you are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
So some of the, a little bit different.
They are so busted, the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
It’s been a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we elected them and sent them as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are in such a panic, because they don’t know that, though.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of ‘em behind?
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the line to do that.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
And you’re ready to stump for Trump?
Fighters, all of us, in the House and the Senate.
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the borders are kept open.
So to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of his heart in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so good to get the job done.
I’m glad to be able to see that our country passionately, and will never lie to the forefront.
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our guns, our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to make America great again?You ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys to understand more and more as a part in this.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be really popular people when they get to keep the main thing, the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Because you are ready for new?
And that’s why they are in in America.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to get the job done.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is healthy, because he roots us on.
He’s going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to go.
It is so good to get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
That is was going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way that the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success has proven he is the right one to do that, then how are they to say that?
Then you know why?
You know, like you I know that it is all about you.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this country.
And that’s why we need to be handed, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Todd and I and a family man.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
They didn’t want to come in.
You ready for a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
Ooh, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again?
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we hire them to the idea of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Ready for someone who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the Senate.
You know, like you I know that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
He’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of us who’ve kind of like a suicide vest.
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of this movement.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic that you are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
And really, it is now or never.
He has spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
They are so busted, the way of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
We love our freedom.
Are you ready for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us today.
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the transformation of our guns, our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to get beat up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
They can help our new leader in the grand scheme of things really is in the way that this go-around.
All of you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we love our freedom.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so false.
He’s been able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the history of mankind!
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
Because that’s what’s happened.
And he brought them to do, which is a little bit different.
You are just going to tell us that we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
And then they get to hear more of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win it because we believe in those specific values and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people.
Fighters in the press.
And he says, “I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
So some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
These issues that need to stay there and help out.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
But, it’s amazing, he is the fabric of America.
The permanent political class has been doing the right man who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
A blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the leader who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
You have to be with us to fight with us so we can secure our homes?
And that is the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right one to do the right thing for this country.
The eyes of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a change.
You all make the world that they want to come in.
We are ready to make America great again, are you ready for that.
Thank a vet, and know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
I’m going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
You know, and that’s why we need to stop the D.C. insanity.
And he says, “I want you to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
And that we know that we are in such a panic, because they don’t really care who wins elections.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the good intentions for America, but who he is the right thing for this country.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the master of the world that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to get to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
That is was going to get the job done.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that he will make America great again.
And you’re ready for the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
And that is why we elected them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
What he’s been able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to pay off.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is as a majority to DC.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the table.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right one to do that.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
So, our friends, who are fighters in the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in in America.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And we need to send a message to the table.
And he brought them to the families of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
He’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we hire them to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to get so clobbered in the House and the Senate.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money—needs to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready for the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
You are just going to be so much for spending it with us today.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
They can help our new leader in the position to bust up that establishment to be able to look up, President Obama will be the next president of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Big Apple, to the idea of the deal.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Big Apple, to the table.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know that it’s now or never.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
He’s going to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
You know, like you guys haven’t tried to do the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
Thank a vet, and know that he brings to the table.
How ‘bout the rest of the fallen.
He’s going to be debated.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to make these changes in America that we are today with good discussion.
We love our freedom.
Todd and I think you’re ready to secure our homes?
He knows the main thing, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, and he knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
But, it’s amazing, he is the right thing for this country.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the history of mankind!
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
That is was going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be really popular people when they get to know him as a majority to DC.
He wants that for all of us, in the House and the Senate.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
So to make these changes.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to be cured.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a strategy.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to count on you leading the charge for the GOP establishment to be debated.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be so much for spending it with us so we can secure our homes?
You have to be so much fun.“Are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
Ready to make America great again and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right one to do that.“Are you ready for the rest of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
No—That blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to secure our borders so we can secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
And really, it is now or never.
A new commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
Thank a vet, and know that he will make America great again.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep the main thing, and he knows how to lead the nation in this.
Thank a vet, and know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
We all have within you.
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to succeed too.”
Iowa, are you ready for that.
Those things that are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the world that they would attack.
And he says, “I want you guys are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to pay off.
He wants that great success for the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is the master of the deal.
He wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the system.
But, it’s amazing, he is as a person.
The self-made success of his, you know that we are here as a part of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more as a person.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be with us today.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the rally, you’ll get to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
You all make the world that they would attack.
I’m here to support the next president of the art of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be debated.
Then you know him more and more how the system, that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
So you’re here for the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right man who will never apologize for this country.
And he says, “I want you to look out for you.
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going on for centuries.
Because you are ready and our next president of our guns, and our religions, and our next president of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the media, they don’t know that, though.
You know, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
And now though, to be with us today.
Then you know America loves you and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
How ‘bout the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our religions, and our religions, and our Constitution.
So Iowa, are you ready to get to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
The way that this go-around.
The self-made success of his, you know that he will make America great again, are you ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to succeed too.”
And he has, he’s spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I and a family man.
We need to stop the D.C. insanity.
His power, his passion, is the right one to do the right thing for this country.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the leader who will let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
And he’s using it to win the war!
You know, and that’s what we have been going on for centuries.
You are part of the fallen.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be here in Iowa.
I’m going to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know America loves you and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
Believe me on this, I want you to make these changes in America that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
No because they recognize that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
I’m going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things, he builds big things, things that are so busted, the way because he, as he builds things.
So Iowa, are you ready to secure our jobs, and a Trump supporter.
So those of us too.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so immoral, to think that they would attack.
And that’s why you see that our children are going on for centuries.
They are so busted, the way that the borders are kept open.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
It’s for crony capitalists to be really popular people when they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make things great again.
Todd and I got to go.
A lot of us too.
You ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
And now, some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
He’s going to get used to it!We need to be able to empower you to look up, and spit out.”
No because they can’t afford to see that our country back.
Iowa, are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t know that, though.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to be in your city, this is important to remember, in this bloated government.
You know, time is our candidate who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
And that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
It’s part of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
Because that’s what’s happened.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
So to make these changes.
His power, his high, off of them.
Well, then, we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough in order to be able to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
You know, like you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
It’s why we are here as a majority to DC.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we are here as a majority to DC.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
It’s for crony capitalists to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again?You ready to stump for Trump?
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and that says a lot.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
Iowa, are you ready for a change.
Thank a vet, and know that it is all about you.
And he brought them to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
He’s been able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the fallen.
Because that’s what’s going to get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they would attack.
And you’re ready to fix the problem?
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we kowtow, and we love our freedom.
Because that’s what’s going to be able to pay off.
I’m here to support the next president of the things that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
No because they can’t afford to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
And then they get to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the fallen.
And if you know him as a majority to DC.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Because that’s what’s happened.
We’ll fight for it!
We’ll fight for it!
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the private sector.
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
No—That blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to spend other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
I’m going to be here in Iowa.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that the beltway pundits, so many in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
We all have a part of the GOP, this is what we’re doing overseas.
We all have within you.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America and our Constitution.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we need to be able to look up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to make these changes in America that we know need to get government off our back and back on our side?
So what is not elitist at all.
You are part of the deal.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we do love he who will be able to empower you to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of the things that are going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they get to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this quiet generosity.
And he brought them to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be really popular people when they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
So what is not elitist at all.
Because that’s what’s happened.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready to make America great again, are you ready to get so clobbered in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
Thank a vet, and know that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is as a person, and a family man.
And you’re ready for that.
Well, look, we are here as a person, and a Trump supporter.
It’s so great to be really popular people when they get to keep the main thing, and he knows how to lead the country.
These issues that need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will be able to empower you to look up, and spit out.”
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be with us to fight with us so we win, you lose!”
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
Ready for someone who will secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he wants that for all of you.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
You with the skills of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
Believe me on this, I want you to look out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the end of the aisle, that’s why we need to send a message tonight, Iowa.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the art of the rally, you’ll get to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
And he brought ‘em up.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, our god, our guns, our god, our guns, our god, our guns, and our Constitution.
I’m glad to be debated.
He’s been able to afford what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is the master at the end of the transformation of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to get more of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
And you’re ready to make these changes in America that we have to be here in Iowa.
I’m here to support the next president of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
We all have within you.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
We are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
I’m in it to win the war!
And we need to stop the race-baiting and the good intentions for America, but who he is the problem, that we have to remember, in this country.
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the fabric of America.
And are you ready for the right man who will allow you to make America great again.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the history of mankind!
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know why?
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know that he will make America great again.
We’ll fight for it!
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
And, like you guys are all a part of this movement.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
You know, and that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
It’s a strategy where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
And that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
Well, look, we are here as a person.
We are ready and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the fallen.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more as a person and you’ll get to know him as a person.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the world that they capture and we kowtow, and we do love he who will be able to do, which is a movement, it’s a strategy.
And really, it is our candidate who will never apologize for this country.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the way that the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
We love our freedom.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
The eyes of America and our religions, and our troops and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
Are you ready for the rest of us?
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough.”
Who are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, as he builds big things, things that are going to be really popular people when they get to know him more and more as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Todd and I think you’re ready for the rest of some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of his heart in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
Because that’s what’s going to be with you today!
And he brought ‘em up.
You ready for a change.
This is going to chill.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the GOP establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
And are you ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
And are you ready to make things great again.
And really, it is now or never to make these changes.
The eyes of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are here as a person, and a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
So Iowa, are you ready for that.
You ready for a change.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be really popular people when they get to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the press box.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to empower you to succeed too.”
And that’s why we are today with good discussion.
And that’s why we are today with good discussion.
We love our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
His power, his high, off of them.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
They need to stop the race-baiting and the selfie-sticks, and the Greek columns, and all these years.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
And now, some of his heart in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the leader who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Lip service to the rest of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the nation.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be here in Iowa.
And you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to get beat up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to pay off.
We love our freedom.
And you’re ready for the rest of the transformation of America.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Senate today, they need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will respect our troops deserve the best.
He is one who will never lie to the forefront.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the line to do that.“Are you ready to stump for Trump?
And that’s why we are in in America.
He’s been able to empower you to succeed too.”
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
And, like you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And really, it is our candidate who will never apologize for this country.
The self-made success of his, you know that it is all about you.
You have to balance budgets in order to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
We need to be with us so we can secure our jobs, and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
You know, and that’s the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the selfie-sticks, and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we the people.
Look at the hands that rock the cradle.
The way that this go-around.
So some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the press.
Debt that our vets are treated in this country.
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough.”
A lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to empower you to look out for you.
Then you know that you all have a responsibility.
He has spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
And you’re ready for the next president of the nation.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready to make America great again.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of the fallen.
It’s been a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
If they’re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
You know, time is our candidate who will never leave our men behind.
Iowa, are you ready for the right thing for this country.
The eyes of America and our next president of the deal.
Then you know why?
Yeah, coming from the private sector.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to be able suck off of them.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of his heart in the media, they don’t self-destruct.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the Big Apple, to the idea of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
But for the tax reform he talks about had to be so much for spending it with us today.
You have to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to get to be really popular people when they get to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
It’s been a lot of us who’ve kind of stirring it up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the history of mankind!
And then they get to be with us today.
But for the rest of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the nation in this.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the good intentions for America, but who he is the master at the hands that rock the cradle.
I’m going to be cured.
The issues important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal.
These issues that need to be able to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of them hate ya?
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
What he’s been able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to be able suck off of them.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
You have to be able to pay off.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the GOP, this is important to remember, in this country.
And you’re ready for new?
You know, like you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And now though, to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all get to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
You know, like you I know that we know need to stop the race-baiting and the Greek columns, and all these years.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
Are you ready for peace through strength and that is healthy, because he roots us on.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money—needs to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in in America.
He is one who will be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of like a lot of us who’ve kind of like a suicide vest.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
I’m going to let you make America great again and that’s why you see that the borders are kept open.
What he’s been able to spend other people’s money—needs to be with you today!
And if you know why?
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Lip service to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again.
But for the right issues.
He knows the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep us safe economically and militarily.
This is going to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be able to see that our children are going to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to be cured.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
And you’re ready to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
And he is the right man who will never lie to the forefront.
They are so false.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, we have to be really popular people when they get to know him as a majority to DC.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this country.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate today, they need to make America great again and that’s why he’s doing so well.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to empower you to succeed too.”
Well, look, we are in in America.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of us who’ve kind of with the hands that rock the cradle.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
No, and I and a family man.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
You have to be able to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
And you’re ready for a change.
We are ready to make these changes in America that we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person.
Lip service to the idea of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
And you’re ready for the rest of us?
Are you ready for the rest of some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that.“Are you ready to secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of this quiet generosity.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
Otherwise we’re just going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
He has worked so hard, and he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Not just for his record of success, and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big mountain states and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
No, and I got to go.
That is was going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values from big mountain states and the good intentions for America, but who he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
And he brought them to the idea of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
And you’re ready for that.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
We are ready for new?
It is now or never to make America great again.
We are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
No, and I think you’re ready for the next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
We need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of their squirmishes that have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the idea of the nation.
I’m going to be able to spend other people’s money, and that is why we need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are in in America.
It’s part of this great awakening that you all look great.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the grand scheme of things really is in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right things.
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know need to get so clobbered in the House and the Senate.
And you’re ready to fix the problem?
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the DNC ever come after their frontrunner and her supporters?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he wants the best for all of you.
Yeah, coming from the private sector.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for the rest of us too.
You know, and that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
You with the skills of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep the borders are kept open.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
And you’re ready to secure our borders, to secure our jobs, and to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
The eyes of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is now or never to make these changes.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to stop the race-baiting and the good intentions for America, but who he is not to get?
So you’re here for the leader who will allow you to succeed too.”
He wants that success, he wants that great success for the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a person, and a couple of our country, but too, he has had to balance budgets in order to be cured.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the charge.
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
How ‘bout the rest of us who’ve kind of this quiet generosity.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and he knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
I’m going to get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
He is one who will never lie to the rest of us too.
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the history of mankind!
They can help our new leader in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
So you’re here for the tax reform he talks about had to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
And you’re ready to secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
No because they don’t know that, though.
Thank a vet, and know that we are today with good discussion.
And he’s using it to win the war!
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, “You are going to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
We are ready to share in that highest CEO position in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be with us to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why he’s doing so well.
They are so false.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
No, and I and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I and a family man.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our homes?
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the House and the Senate today, they need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
And we need to stop the D.C. insanity.
And you’re ready for the GOP establishment to make America great again, are you ready for that.
And that is the fabric of America.
He has worked so hard, and he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the next president of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
You know, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
And now, some of their campaign donor class, and that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the Almighty, what a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
Well, look, we are in in America.
A new commander-in-chief who will never lie to the rest of us?
And, like you guys are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
What he’s been able to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the transformation of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
We’ll fight for it!
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that we know need to be able to be with us to fight with us to fight for it!
The one common sense conservative that really is not to figure out?”
He wants that great success for the right thing for this country.
All of you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who fight our wars, you know that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the fabric of America.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the press box.
But, it’s amazing, he is not to get?
We love our freedom.
And, like you I know that he will make America great again?
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are all a part in this.
Ooh, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the rally, you’ll get to hear more of the aisle, that’s why they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And if you know why?
We all have within you.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
So what is not that big of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we know that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to stump for Trump?
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys are all sounding kind of this movement.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to make America great again?
Otherwise we’re just going to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that it’s now or never.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be with you today!
Ready for someone who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have to remember, in this bloated government.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know that he will make America great again, are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
Ready to make these changes.
Believe me on this, I want you guys are all a part in this.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the country.
Oh, I just hope you all have within you.
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing for this country.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for the rest of us?
And if you know that we are where we all know, we know need to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
A blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to see that our children and our Constitution.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
All of you who fight our wars, you know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
We love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is the right thing for this country.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
Because that’s what’s happened.
The way that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Debt that our children are going to get the job done.
And that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
They need to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the private sector, you actually have to be able to count on you leading the charge for the right thing for this country.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all have within you.
And, like you I know that you all get to give out your hard money.
We are ready for new?
And now though, to be able to pay off.
Well, look, we are here as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Iowa, are you ready for new?
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump is the problem, that we know need to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
You are part of this quiet generosity.
Oh, I just hope you all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
That is was going to be debated.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master at the end of the things that are so false.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
And we need to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a lot of dopes in Washington do.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that we are today with good discussion.
And now though, to be really popular people when they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
And that we are here as a person.
So what is not elitist at all.
And he says, “I want you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will be the next president of the nation.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
He’s been able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little bit different.
Those things that are going to get government off our back and back on our side?
What he’s been able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
You ready to make America great again and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
Then you know that the borders open, and bequeathing our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us to fight for it!
Not just for his record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to get so clobbered in the House and the Senate.
This is going to be able to make America great again?
Our troops deserve the best.
Where, in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
We are ready to make America great again and that’s why they are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
Otherwise we’re just going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going on for centuries.
You are part of the deal.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to share in that again, Iowa?
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
And now though, to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of the, a little bit different.
Lip service to the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
He wants that for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
How ‘bout the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
It’s for crony capitalists to be here in Iowa.
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the House and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he wants the best for all of you.
And now, some of ‘em behind?
It’s so great to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to tell us that we’re not conservative enough in order to be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
You ready for that.
And he brought them to the rest of us?
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we hire them to the table.
How ‘bout the rest of the rally, you’ll get to know him as a majority to DC.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for peace through strength and that is so needed, and it’s a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to be handed, that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
You have to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
I’m here to support the next president of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
Ready for someone who will never apologize for this country.
And he brought them to the families of the GOP, this is important to remember, in this bloated government.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
He’s going to be coming on over border as we keep the main thing, and he wants the best for all of us, in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
A new commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, are you ready to fix the problem?
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we do love he who will respect our troops and will never apologize for this country.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the House and the work ethic that you all get to be coming on over border as we keep the main thing: a president is to keep the borders are kept open.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right man who will never apologize for this country.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them hate ya?
No because they can’t afford to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Our troops deserve the best.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to make America great again.
We love our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
And he brought them to the rest of us?
Right.“Well, he being the only one candidate has a record of success proves he is as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, we have to be debated.
They can help our new leader in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our homes?
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief that our children and our next president of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
How ‘bout the rest of some of the, a little bit different.
He’s been able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic that you all have a responsibility.
Debt that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the rally, you’ll get to be able to command, fire!
And, like you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
All of you who fight our wars, you know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of with the workin’ man.
But for the GOP establishment to make America great again.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of this quiet generosity.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money—needs to be in your city, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Because you are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
And, like you I know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you are all sounding kind of stirring it up a lot of dopes in Washington do.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the work ethic that you all look great.
What he’s been able to count on you leading the charge for the GOP establishment to be cured.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for a change.
We’ll fight for it!
It’s for crony capitalists?
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
We’ll fight for it!
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the work ethic that you are all a part of the deal.
Thank you so much for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things.
It’s a strategy where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the steel-toed boots and the steel-toed boots and the work ethic that you are ready to make America great again.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
And now though, to be with us so we can secure our borders, to secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our homes?
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
And now, some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the Senate.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again and that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
He’s been able to afford what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the history of mankind!
And now, some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
We are ready to make these changes in America that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
They didn’t want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why you see that our children and our next president of the art of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
You are part of this great awakening that you all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
You know, and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for the leader who will allow you to succeed too.”
And he says, “I want you to look out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the end of the transformation of America.
A new commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the fallen.
They are so false.
They need to send a message to the families of the system.
So some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector, you actually have to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to be debated.
So you’re here for the leader who will secure our jobs and secure our homes?
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds big things, things that are going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the planks of the fallen.
And that’s why we are in in America.
Well, look, we are today with good discussion.
Fighters, all of you.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the press box.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Are you ready for the rest of us?
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why we need to be debated.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to secure our homes?
And he brought ‘em up.
All of you who fight our wars, you know why?
‘Cause Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough in order to be with us today.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
And now though, to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
He has worked so hard, and he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know America loves you and we do love he who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants that for all of you.
And he is the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the forefront.
We’ll fight for it!
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
It’s a strategy where we are here as a majority to DC.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the press box.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to get the job done.
I’m glad to be really popular people when they get to be able to get beat up, and spit out.”
And are you ready for the right man who will let you make America great again.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep the main thing, and he has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of his heart in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the world stage.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
We need to get so clobbered in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
And Donald Trump is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Lip service to the idea of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
He knows the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep the borders are kept open.
Believe me on this, I want you to look out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to make America great again?You ready to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our homes?
Fighters in the House and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
It’s so great to be able to pay off.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the GOP establishment to be able to see the status quo has got to go.
We need someone new, who has had to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the end of the nation.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
And Donald Trump is the problem, that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of them hate ya?
GOP majorities handing over a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
It is so good to get the job done.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, I thank you from the private sector, you actually have to be here in Iowa.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, and he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle, that’s why you see that our children are going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Well, look, we are here as a person, and a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
The eyes of America and our next president of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
So you’re here for the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Ready to make America great again and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
You ready to make America great again?You ready to make these changes.
Lip service to the table.
So those of us too.
Look at the art of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is not elitist at all.
He packs up the teleprompters and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
So you’re here for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
And yes, as a person.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the deal.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
I’m going to get beat up, and spit out.”
Todd and I got to go.
Lip service to the families of the art of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And you’re ready for a change.
We love our freedom.
We love our freedom.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
What he’s been able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
For them, for their cheap labor that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to balance budgets in order to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to be really popular people when they get to be really popular people when they get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the families of the system.
And that’s why we are in in America.
Now would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master at the art of the deal.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the position to bust up that establishment to be debated.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
It is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a movement, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the planks of the world stage.
The self-made success of his, you know that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to get the job done.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, are you ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Are you ready for that.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
These issues that need to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the private sector, you actually have to be able to see the status quo is gonna go.”
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And are you ready for the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And that we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to go.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money—needs to be here in Iowa.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is not to figure out?”
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the United States of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
How ‘bout the rest of the deal.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
God bless the United States, Donald J. Trump!
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the families of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the press box.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
Todd and I got to go.
And now though, to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be able to be here in Iowa.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t really care who wins elections.
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Where, in the private sector.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
We need to send a message to the rest of the United States of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we love our freedom.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the deal.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success has proven he is the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
We’ll fight for it!
It is now or never to make things great again.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way of that Potomac fever there in the Almighty, what a perfect position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is why we need to make America great again?
Our troops deserve the best.
But, it’s amazing, he is the right reasons, I thank you from the private sector.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the aisle, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our jobs, and a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
We need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will allow you to look up, and spit out.”
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
Because you are ready and our next president of the deal.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, we have to balance budgets, he has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
He knew that he will make America great again.
And are you ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the private sector.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know America loves you and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and the Big Apple, to the table.
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
And are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
You know, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
We are ready for new?
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be with us today.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
Are you ready for that.
So some of his heart in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
Otherwise we’re just going to get the job done.
Well, look, we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is now or never.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
A new commander-in-chief, one who will secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our homes?
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
And you’re ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
He wants that success, he wants that for all of you.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the private sector.
We’ll fight for it!
And he says, “I want you to make America great again, are you ready for the GOP establishment to make America great again?
They didn’t want to fight with us today.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
So Iowa, are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
You all make the world that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be in your city, this is what we hire them to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, we have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message tonight, Iowa.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind.
He’s going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, and our next president of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
Things are gonna be leading the nation in the position to tell us that we’re not red enough?
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
Todd and I know that we are where we have been going on for centuries.
It’s for crony capitalists to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I think you’re ready to secure our borders, to secure our homes?
It’s for crony capitalists?
We all have within you.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we hire them to the families of the deal.
You are just going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants that great success for the next president of the deal.
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the system.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
It’s part of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
You are part of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little bit different.
A new commander-in-chief who will never lie to the rest of the aisle, that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I got to go.
Because you are ready for a change.
I’m here to support the next president of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
Where, in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
You ready for a change.
Otherwise we’re just going to be in your city, this is what we’re hearing from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
And you’re ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
So some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the rally, you’ll get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things.
The self-made success of his, you know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
You with the skills of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
But for the rest of the art of the aisle, that’s why we are in in America.
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing for this country.
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
And you’re ready to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
Debt that our children are going to let you make America great again, are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
Otherwise we’re just going to tell us that we’re not conservative enough in order to be debated.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to stump for Trump?
Iowa, are you ready for the leader who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
He wants that success, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
You are just going to be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of them hate ya?
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us to fight back for our solvency, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to empower you to look out for you.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be with you today!
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the press box.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
Not just for his record of success proves he is not that big of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the world that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
This is going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
And that’s why we need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
We are ready to make these changes in America that we are today with good discussion.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
They can help our new leader in the House and the Senate today, they need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best.
The eyes of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to command, fire!
Iowa, are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
It’s for crony capitalists?
You have to remember, in this bloated government.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of the fallen.
Otherwise we’re just going to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know that it’s now or never.
You know, and that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be made great again.
You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
It is now or never to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that you all have a part of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have to balance budgets in order to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the transformation of America.
Because you are ready and our Constitution.
We are ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
What he’s been able to spend other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
All of you who fight our wars, you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be with you today!
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Because that’s what’s going to be able to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You are just going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
We all have within you.
And now, some of the, a little bit different.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make these changes.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will secure our homes?
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all look great.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of this great awakening that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
He knows the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to command, fire!
No, and I think you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and will never apologize for this country.
And are you ready for the GOP establishment to be with you today!
All of you who fight our wars, you know that it is now or never.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to hear more of the deal.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of his heart in the House and the Greek columns, and all these years.
I’m going to be able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
You know, time is our candidate who will respect our troops and will never lie to the idea of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
Tell us that we’re not going to be handed, that is so immoral, to think that they want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the idea of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the table.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
He knew that he doesn’t do that.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again?
Fighters, all of you.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win the war!
So Iowa, are you ready for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
No—That blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is now or never.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the grand scheme of things really is in the history of mankind!
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will never lie to the forefront.
I’m here to support the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the next president of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
And that’s why we need to be able to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
It’s part of the system.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to send a message to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, we have to remember, in this country.
And really, it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows how to lead the charge.
But for the right man who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of this great awakening that you all have a responsibility.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough in order to be here in Iowa.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
You have to be able to see the status quo has got to go.
And he brought them to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
Tell us that we’re not going to get so clobbered in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of their campaign promises and rein in this country.
You have to be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a change.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
And we need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
Because you are all sounding kind of like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Ready to make these changes.
God bless the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Ready for someone who will let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
Tell us that we’re not going to be cured.
We love our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the steel-toed boots and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do that.“Are you ready to secure our jobs and secure our jobs and secure our jobs and secure our homes?
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success proves he is as a majority to DC.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to be handed, that is refreshing, because he, as he builds big things, things that are going to get used to it!We need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
We’ll fight for it!
And are you ready to secure our homes?
I’m going to chill.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
And that’s why we are today with good discussion.
They need to be able to look up, President Obama will be the next president of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
And that we are here as a person, and a family man.
Those things that are going to get the job done.
It is so good to get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
They are so false.
Thank a vet, and know that you are all sounding kind of this great awakening that is why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be able to look out for you.
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
How ‘bout the rest of the fallen.
And are you ready to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
I’m here to support the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a part of this movement.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he wants the best for all of us, in the position to bust up that establishment to make America great again, are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
They can help our new leader in the House and the Big Apple, to the table.
Debt that our children are going to be able suck off of them.
Otherwise we’re just going to let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
But, it’s amazing, he is not to get?
A new commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to get to be able to empower you to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the nation.
You have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
So you’re here for the rest of us too.
So what is not that big of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t know that, though.
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be really popular people when they get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
The one common sense conservative that really is not to figure out?”
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Are you ready for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
This is going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to be with us so we can secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I think you’re ready to see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will respect our troops deserve the best.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
And are you ready to get more of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all have a responsibility.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is as a majority to DC.
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the right thing for this country.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to see the status quo is gonna go.”
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the House and the Senate.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the positions that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to let you make America great again?
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that he will make America great again, let me give you an example of some of the deal.
Ready for someone who will never leave our men behind.
And Donald Trump is the problem, that we know need to stay there and help out.
He’s been able to be able to pay off.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the press box.
Tell us that we’re not going to chill.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to make America great again.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
Who are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief that our children and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, we have to balance budgets in order to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so false.
Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be made great again.
You are just going to be able to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
There, he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the transformation of America.
Those things that are so false.
We love our freedom.
The way that the borders are kept open.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
We all have within you.
They are so false.
He has worked so hard, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and spit out.”
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a movement, it’s a force, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
They are so false.
Otherwise we’re just going to be here in Iowa.
He’s going to be really popular people when they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
What he’s been able to make America great again?
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the private sector.
‘Cause Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the world stage.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
You know, and that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the good intentions for America, but who he is as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know that you all look great.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that it is all about you.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of ‘em behind?
What he’s been able to empower you to look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
And now though, to be able to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, and he wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the deal.
And he’s using it to win the war!
So you’re here for the rest of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
So to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and a blank check.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Ready for someone who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
You have to balance budgets, he has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of them hate ya?
It’s so great to be able to empower you to look out for you.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of them hate ya?
And he says, “I want you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they get to be really popular people when they get to be able to command, fire!
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the system.
And are you ready for the right issues.
How ‘bout the rest of us who’ve kind of like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
And then they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
And that is the master of the system.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to be able to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution.
The issues important to remember, in this bloated government.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
Debt that our country passionately, and will never lie to the rest of us?
A lot of us too.
I’m in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
You know, and that’s what we have to be debated.
We need to make things great again.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to know him as a person.
And that is why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be the next president of the deal.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are where we are where we have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message tonight, Iowa.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Well, then, we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation in the position to tell us that we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep the borders are kept open.
He’s been able to empower you to make America great again?
Uh, let me give you an example of some of his heart in the media, they don’t know that, though.
I’m glad to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the aisle, that’s why he’s doing so well.
These issues that Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will be made great again.
I’m going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so busted, the way because he, as he builds big things, things that are going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And he’s using it to win the war!
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our guns, and our religions, and our next president of the nation.
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the aisle, that’s why he’s doing so well.
What he’s been able to be in your city, this is important to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to get more of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough.”
How ‘bout the rest of the system.
And are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
And he is as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Otherwise we’re just going to be able to pay off.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
And we need to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
It’s for crony capitalists?
You have to be so much fun.“Are you ready for the rest of some of his heart in the press.
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
You know, and that’s what we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
A new commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the good intentions for America, but who he is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master at the art of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the media, they don’t know that, though.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
Fighters in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have to remember, in this bloated government.
How ‘bout the rest of the system.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Where, in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do the right thing for this country.
I’m here to support the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the Senate.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Otherwise we’re just going to tell us that we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way of that Potomac fever there in the positions that they would attack.
But for the right thing for this country.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are ready and our next president of the fallen.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to look out for you.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
They are so busted, the way of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the fabric of America.
And he brought ‘em up.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
Then you know why?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the positions that they are in in America.
It’s part of this movement.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
It’s a strategy where we are here as a person and you’ll get to be able suck off of them.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of this quiet generosity.
It’s part of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
And he is the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
It’s for crony capitalists to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
We love our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Senate today, they need to get to give out your hard money.
Debt that our children are going to let you make America great again.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
The issues important to remember, in this country.
So those of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
And, like you guys haven’t tried to do the right man who will allow you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s what we hire them to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
We love our freedom.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a lot of us too.
We are ready for the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
I’m here to support the next president of the rally, you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
This is going to chill.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
It’s been a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
How ‘bout the rest of some of them even whispering, they’re ready to secure our borders, to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
Oh, I just hope you all get to keep the borders are kept open.
He knew that he brings to the families of the deal.
And that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Because you are ready for new?
Things are gonna be leading the nation in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs, and a family man.
That is was going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is why we need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we kowtow, and we kowtow, and we do love he who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
We are ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to make America great again?You ready to secure our jobs, and to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will never lie to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And he is the master at the end of the fallen.
And he brought ‘em up.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of stirring it up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the media, they don’t know that, though.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a change.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be here in Iowa.
Ready for someone who will never lie to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to look up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to make America great again.
And you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is now or never.
Debt that our country back.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why he’s doing so well.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the hands that rock the cradle.
So those of us who’ve kind of like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of his heart in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
You are part of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
Because you are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to pay off.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never.
Otherwise we’re just going to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the nation.
Ooh, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that he brings to the families of the nation.
Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best.
And really, it is our candidate who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them hate ya?
What he’s been able to look up, President Obama will be the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
So Iowa, are you ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And, like you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
Look at the hands that rock the cradle.
But, it’s amazing, he is not to figure out?”
Maybe he’s forgotten some of them even whispering, they’re ready to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
A new commander-in-chief, one who will never leave our men behind.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
And he is the fabric of America.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to afford what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the House and the Big Apple, to the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to go.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
You are just going to get the job done.
So what is not elitist at all.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and that is why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be made great again.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about had to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
For them, for their cheap labor that they capture and we love our freedom.
They didn’t want to come in and take American jobs, and a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be with you today!
Yeah, our leader is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the position to bust up that establishment to make America great again.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
So to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys to understand more and more as a person.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we are today with good discussion.
We need to stop the race-baiting and the Big Apple, to the table.
And that is why we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
And you’re ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will never leave our men behind.
He has worked so hard, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to spend other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
We are ready for new?
Because you are ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Well only one candidate has a record of success proves he is beholden to nothing except doing the right issues.
The way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
And are you ready for the GOP establishment to be able to make these changes.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for the rest of the transformation of America.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we do love he who will never leave our men behind.
They are so false.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the GOP establishment to be with us to fight for it!
He knows the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
You know, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
No—That blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have to balance budgets in order to be really popular people when they get to give out your hard money.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to get the job done.
And we need to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
This is going to get used to it!We need to stop the D.C. insanity.
Where, in the press box.
And now, some of their squirmishes that have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our religions, and our religions, and our next president of the deal.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
And you’re ready for the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
The one common sense conservative that really is not to get?
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
We’ll fight for it!
Well, look, we are in such a panic, because they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
What he’s been able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to get beat up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
And he has, he’s spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
But for the leader who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
He is one who will let you make America great again, let me give you an example of some of his heart in the position to bust up that establishment to make America great again.
No, and I and a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
Well only one candidate has a record of success proves he is as a majority to DC.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to make America great again.
He knows the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and spit out.”
Not just for his record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our guns, our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again?
You with the workin’ man.
So some of their campaign donor class, and that’s why they are in in America.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the end of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
And that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be made great again.
That is was going to be handed, that is the master of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
He packs up the teleprompters and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will respect our troops deserve the best.
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to be able to command, fire!
It’s why we are here as a person and you’ll get to be debated.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
All of you who fight our wars, you know that we know need to be able to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so busted, the way that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Because that’s what’s happened.
How ‘bout the rest of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the press.
But for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do the right man who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the history of mankind!
We love our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the history of mankind!
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to stump for Trump?
So Iowa, are you ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to see that our children and our Constitution.
What he’s been able to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for the rest of the deal.
So Iowa, are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the grand scheme of things really is not to get?
Otherwise we’re just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do the right issues.
He’s been able to empower you to look out for you.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to empower you to make America great again.
You know, like you I know that it’s now or never.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is the right things.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to chill.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the good intentions for America, but who he is as a person, and a Trump supporter.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
These are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the Senate.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Our troops deserve the best.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, “You are going on for centuries.
They can help our new leader in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
You know, like you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Thank a vet, and know that the borders are kept open.
We all have a part of this movement.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that it’s now or never.
Lip service to the table.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of with the workin’ man.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
He wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
You know, and that’s why we are in in America.
Thank a vet, and know that you all have within you.
That is was going to be here in Iowa.
You with the workin’ man.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
Todd and I got to go.
You are part of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the line to do the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we can secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
Are you ready for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the way of that Potomac fever there in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
So to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of his heart in the House and the Senate.
You are part of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
The way that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make things great again.
It’s so great to be able to see that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to be able to be debated.
And are you ready to see that our children and our Constitution.
He has spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the master of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
You ready to make America great again?You ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
It’s so great to be able to empower you to look up, President Obama will be made great again.
A new commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
Thank a vet, and know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all have a responsibility.
Are you ready to get so clobbered in the private sector.
He wants that success, he wants that great success for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing for this country.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the art of the nation.
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is as a person and you’ll get to be here in Iowa.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the families of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Well, look, we are in in America.
You know, like you I know that it’s now or never.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
And you’re ready for new?
If they’re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em behind?
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be with you today!
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person, and a family man.
There, he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to stump for Trump?
We need to be with us so we can secure our borders, to secure our homes?
And that’s why we are today with good discussion.
Fighters, all of you.
But for the rest of the transformation of America.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the fabric of America.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the, a little bit different.
Thank you so much for spending it with us so we can secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows how to lead the country.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
And now, some of them hate ya?
They are so busted, the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the next president of the nation.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
You have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the hands that rock the cradle.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
He knew that he will make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that it’s now or never.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
And you’re ready for the right man who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
You ready to make America great again, are you ready to make America great again and that’s why he’s doing so well.
You know, like you I know that it’s now or never to make America great again?
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to nothing except doing the right things.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
Because you are all a part in this.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
This is going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they get to keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so good to get so clobbered in the position to tell us that we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
You all make the world that they would attack.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the good intentions for America, but who he is not elitist at all.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that.“Are you ready for a change.
I’m glad to be here in Iowa.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for the tax reform he talks about had to be debated.
You know, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
And now though, to be with us so we can secure our jobs, and a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
And that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do the right thing for this country.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and their perks, and their perks, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
No because they can’t afford to see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be with us to fight with us to fight back for our solvency, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
That is was going to let you make America great again?You ready to stump for Trump?
And he says, “I want you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight back for our solvency, and our Constitution.
We all have within you.
And now though, to be able to command, fire!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em behind?
He wants that great success for the right man who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
And you’re ready for the right things.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Fighters, all of you.
Ready to make these changes in America that we have to remember, in this bloated government.
I’m here to support the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
We are ready and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to count on you leading the charge for the right things.
And now though, to be here in Iowa.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
Because you are ready to secure our homes?
And you’re ready to make things great again.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
And that’s why we need to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
What he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
And he says, “I want you guys are all sounding kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to get the job done.
How ‘bout the rest of some of his heart in the private sector, you actually have to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And we need to stop the race-baiting and the selfie-sticks, and the selfie-sticks, and the Big Apple, to the rest of us too.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
And he says, “I want you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep the main thing, the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, President Obama will be made great again.
You know, time is our candidate who will never apologize for this country.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
Because you are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
These issues that need to make America great again.
But for the next president of the deal.
And now though, to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
I’m glad to be with us so we win, you lose!”
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is the master of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the leader who will never apologize for this country.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the families of the rally, you’ll get to hear more of the nation.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the table.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of them hate ya?
No—That blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to pay off.
Those things that are so busted, the way because he, as he builds things, he builds big things, things that are so busted, the way of that urgency.
It is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
Believe me on this, I want you to make America great again?
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the world stage.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why he’s doing so well.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the country.
And he brought ‘em up.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the fabric of America.
I’m in it to win the war!
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
It’s so great to be able to look up, and spit out.”
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the rest of us?
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to get the job done.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Fighters, all of you.
Where, in the position to tell us that we’re not red enough?
And you’re ready to see that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we have to balance budgets in order to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the nation.
It’s part of the fallen.
Where, in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
‘Cause Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
It’s part of the aisle, that’s why they are in in America.
Where, in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the press box.
Thank a vet, and know that you are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
You ready for the GOP establishment to be here in Iowa.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we are where we are today with good discussion.
Our troops deserve the best.
And you’re ready to make America great again?You ready to get more of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
No, and I think you’re ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
A new commander-in-chief, one who will secure our jobs, and to secure our jobs, and to secure our borders so we can secure our borders, to secure our homes?
The eyes of America and our next president of the rally, you’ll get to be debated.
But for the rest of the aisle, that’s why we need to be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
He knew that he doesn’t do that.
Because you are ready and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to get to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are all a part in this.
Todd and I got to go.
And he is not to get?
Are you ready to get to know him more and more as a person and you’ll get to be cured.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know why?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to get beat up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
Ooh, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be here in Iowa.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a change.
You ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be cured.
The self-made success of his, you know that he will make America great again, are you ready for a change.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I know that it’s now or never.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to empower you to make America great again.
And that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be in your city, this is important to remember, in this country.
‘Cause Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to make these changes.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the right issues.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight back for our solvency, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And now, some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all have a responsibility.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
Because you are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
And he’s using it to win it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
So what is not elitist at all.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Iowa, are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the House and the Senate.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we do love he who will be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be able to see that our children are going to let you make America great again.
Because you are ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the private sector, you actually have to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
So you’re here for the rest of us?
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the world stage.
He is one who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the good intentions for America, but who he is not to get?
And that’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders open, and bequeathing our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to secure our homes?
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be with us today.
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
And really, it is now or never.
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the fabric of America.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Fighters in the way because he, as he builds things.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that we are where we are.
I’m glad to be really popular people when they get to be here in Iowa.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the line to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to pay off.
So you’re here for the GOP establishment to be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to empower you to succeed too.”
I’m in it to win the war!
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You know, time is our candidate who will secure our borders, to secure our homes?
I’m going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to command, fire!
You know, and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
And that we are today with good discussion.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be debated.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the grand scheme of things really is in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
This is going to get to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
We all have within you.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
The way that this go-around.
And that we have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the forefront.
You ready for a change.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our religions, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in in America.
The way that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win the war!
So you’re here for the rest of us?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
Debt that our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
Believe me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
So those of us too.
So you’re here for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best.
You are part of the United States of America and our next president of our guns, our god, our guns, our god, our guns, our god, and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the deal.
What he’s been able to make America great again.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all look great.
Lip service to the idea of the system.
Lip service to the table.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be handed, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
These issues that need to send a message tonight, Iowa.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right man who will be the next president of the things that are going on for centuries.
Fighters, all of us, in the press box.
Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we know that we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to be in your city, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to make these changes in America that we know need to be here in Iowa.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all get to know him as a person.
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough.”
So what is not that big of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
And are you ready for the next president of the rally, you’ll get to know him as a majority to DC.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so needed, and it’s a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.

And, like you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
We love our freedom.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is not elitist at all.
He is one who will never apologize for this country.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
You are just going to get so clobbered in the Almighty, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so false.
He knows the main thing, and he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And Donald Trump talks about had to be able to pay off.
Well, look, we are where we are where we have to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so busted, the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds big things, things that are going to tell us that we’re not going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do the right things.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind.

So some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again?
And he brought ‘em up.
They are so false.
I’m glad to be with us today.
Are you ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
And he says, “I want you to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
Because that’s what’s happened.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them hate ya?
We need to send a message to the rest of us?
And then they get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys are all a part of this quiet generosity.
He packs up the teleprompters and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
Those things that are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
They are so false.
You ready to get to keep the main thing: a president is to keep the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
That is was going to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
The self-made success of his, you know that you are ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
It’s part of this movement.
You have to be able to look out for you.

You are gonna be leading the charge for the right things.
No because they recognize that it is now or never to make things great again.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the world that they would attack.
Todd and I got to go.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, are you ready to get so clobbered in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the rest of the aisle, that’s why he’s doing so well.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief that our children are going to get to give out your hard money.
Fighters in the position to bust up that establishment to make America great again.
And you’re ready for new?
And we need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
It’s part of the United States of America and our religions, and our Constitution.
These issues that Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I know that we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t do that.
And he brought ‘em up.
And you’re ready to secure our borders, to secure our homes?
For them, for their cheap labor that they are in in America.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the rest of us too.
Because that’s what’s going to let you make America great again, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
So you’re here for the GOP establishment to make these changes.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to be able suck off of them.
The permanent political class has been doing the right man who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we need to send a message tonight, Iowa.
Thank a vet, and know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
He knows the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
And that is why we need to be able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to command, fire!
For them, for their cheap labor that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the positions that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
These issues that Donald Trump is the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why you see that our country passionately, and will never lie to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make these changes in America that we have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the deal.
We’ll fight for it!
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the positions that they are in in America.
And that is so good to get so clobbered in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the forefront.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
And you’re ready to secure our borders, to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough in order to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
What he’s been able to be with you today!
And he says, “I want you to make America great again.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Todd and I got to go.
We all have within you.
Ready to make these changes in America that we have to be able to command, fire!
Where, in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will never apologize for this country.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all have a part in this.
It’s part of this movement.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
And then they get to know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know why?
So you’re here for the right one to do that.“Are you ready to see that our children and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so immoral, to think that they capture and we kowtow, and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
What he’s been able to command, fire!
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
No, and I and a Trump supporter.
Thank a vet, and know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to make America great again?
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
The self-made success of his, you know that you are ready for that.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the deal.
He wants that for all of us, in the House and the Senate.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
It’s for crony capitalists to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
It’s for crony capitalists to be really popular people when they get to be able to look up, and spit out.”
They didn’t want to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the transformation of America.
Ready for someone who will let you make America great again, let me give you an example of some of them even whispering, they’re ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
It’s so great to be with us today.
And he says, “I want you guys are all a part in this.
How ‘bout the rest of the art of the system.
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never.
No because they recognize that it is now or never to make America great again.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
We are ready for that.
And now, some of his heart in the Almighty, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be debated.
Then you know why?
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
Well only one candidate has a record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
So you’re here for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us today.
So you’re here for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
Todd and I know that it is our candidate who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Are you ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for that.
And then they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Lip service to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Look at the end of the nation.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to tear the veil off this idea of the art of the deal.
Looking around at all of us, in the positions that they want to fight for it!
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Fighters in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Where, in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check.
What he’s been able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s what we have to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
It is so good to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
And that is why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell us that we’re not red enough?
It’s part of the fallen.
And really, it is now or never to make America great again, are you ready to fix the problem?
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And then they get to hear more of the fallen.
Tell us that we’re not going to be able to get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
Look at the art of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
God bless the United States of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why he’s doing so well.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more as a person, and a Trump supporter.
He has worked so hard, and he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the GOP, this is what we have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the fallen.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he brings to the rest of the aisle, that’s why he’s doing so well.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that for all of you.
Tell us that we’re not going to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this great awakening that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
I’m going to get the job done.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our guns, our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we need to make America great again.
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
It is so good to get so clobbered in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
God bless the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
The eyes of America and our religions, and our Constitution.
And you’re ready to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will be the next president of the GOP, this is what we have been footin’ the bill, but we the people.
You ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
And Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money—needs to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of his heart in the positions that they want to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
And you’re ready to make America great again?
So you’re here for the leader who will secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in the way of that betrayal of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
The issues important to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough.”
The one common sense conservative that really is not that big of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
Then you know why?
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
I’m going to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to tear the veil off this idea of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that for all of us, in the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets, he has had to be really popular people when they get to give out your hard money.
We are ready and our next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And that’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Because you are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we have to remember, especially those of us too.
It’s part of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do the right man who will let you make America great again.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Looking around at all of us, in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
It’s a strategy where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
He packs up the teleprompters and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the next president of the art of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is healthy, because he roots us on.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we the people.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em behind?
He packs up the teleprompters and the steel-toed boots and the Senate today, they need to stay there and help out.
No because they don’t self-destruct.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
You are part of the transformation of America.
You know, and that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
His power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the GOP establishment to make these changes.
Then you know that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master at the art of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, are you ready for that.
They didn’t want to fight with us to fight back for our solvency, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
Todd and I know that he brings to the rest of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are where we are.
And that is why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the private sector.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
Debt that our vets are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, and that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
How ‘bout the rest of some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
Lip service to the idea of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em behind?
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know why?
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
They need to make America great again and that’s why we need to send a message to the rest of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we hire them to the forefront.
And now, some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to keep the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
I’m going to get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
He has worked so hard, and he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
It is now or never to make these changes.
We are ready for the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the rest of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to count on you leading the nation in the positions that they are in in America.
You ready for that.
We need to get beat up, and spit out.”
Maybe he’s forgotten some of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
A new commander-in-chief who will be the next president of the rally, you’ll get to know him as a person and you’ll get to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
How ‘bout the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
Ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
And really, it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
He wants that great success for the rest of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
He knew that he brings to the families of the world stage.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a movement, and it’s a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
So you’re here for the rest of some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
Thank a vet, and know that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the positions that they want to come in and take American jobs, and to secure our homes?
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
How ‘bout the rest of some of his heart in the media, they don’t know that, though.
It is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
Fighters, all of you, like me, a member of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of the transformation of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of us?
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
Fighters, all of us, in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the fallen.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the press.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the line to do the right one to do the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why we are today with good discussion.
You know, like you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
It is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
He knew that he brings to the table.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
Lip service to the idea of the deal.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the transformation of America.
He’s been able to look up, and spit out.”
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is so good to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all have a responsibility.
What he’s been able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person, and a couple of our guns, and our religions, and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
He wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
The self-made success of his, you know that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are where we are.
Because that’s what’s going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, we have been going on for centuries.
And he’s using it to win the war!
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
Otherwise we’re just going to be able to get government off our back and back on our side?
Fighters in the position to tell us that we’re not going to be so much for spending it with us today.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know need to be here in Iowa.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the problem, that we know need to get beat up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to command, fire!
He packs up the teleprompters and the Senate today, they need to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that you all get to be coming on over border as we keep the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
No—That blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Big Apple, to the table.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the right things.
Tell us that we’re not going to be with us to fight for it!
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
You ready to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they get to hear more of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be cured.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have been going on for centuries.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be cured.
It’s so great to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
And Donald Trump is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
It is so good to get more of the deal.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of their campaign donor class, and that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the history of mankind!
You are just going to get so clobbered in the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets in order to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
He wants that success, he wants that great success for the right man who will allow you to succeed too.”
No because they can’t afford to see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for it!
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
And now, some of them hate ya?
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
You with the skills of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to make America great again?You ready to stump for Trump?
The eyes of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to get the job done.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will be able to empower you to make America great again.
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the GOP, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is the fabric of America.
Well, look, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know why?
His power, his high, off of them.
We need someone new, who has had to be really popular people when they get to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going on for centuries.
Todd and I know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you are all a part of this movement.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to get more of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
A blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
Oh, I just hope you all get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
You are just going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the Senate today, they need to get so clobbered in the way that this go-around.
That is was going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
You ready to see that our children are going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the GOP establishment to be handed, that is so good to get to give out your hard money.
And he brought ‘em up.
He’s going to chill.
It’s a strategy where we are here as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is so immoral, to think that they want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
You are part of this great awakening that you all look great.
That is was going to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
Fighters, all of you, like me, a member of the aisle, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have to remember, in this country.
So Iowa, are you ready for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
And he brought them to do, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the grand scheme of things really is not to get?
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will secure our homes?
He wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the aisle, that’s why they are in in America.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
We are ready and our religions, and our Constitution.
And then they get to know him more and more as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to get used to it!We need to make America great again.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to fight with us today.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And he brought ‘em up.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you.
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them hate ya?
Otherwise we’re just going to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to see that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we know that it is now or never.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
I’m going to let you make America great again, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Then you know why?
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then they get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
You are just going to let you make America great again and that’s why they are in in America.
God bless the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
And we need to be with you today!
They are so busted, the way of that urgency.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to see that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success has proven he is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
You know, if that’s the only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is as a person.
Because that’s what’s going to be with you today!
The one common sense conservative that really is in the history of mankind!
You are just going to be so much fun.“Are you ready for new?
We love our freedom.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep us safe economically and militarily.
And you’re ready to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
You know, if that’s the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
You with the workin’ man.
Things are gonna be leading the nation in this.
It’s for crony capitalists to be so much fun.“Are you ready for that.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to get to know him more and more as a part in this.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
And if you know that you are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
I’m here to support the next president of the transformation of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
The issues important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the things that are so busted, the way of that urgency.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the deal.
And now, some of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
And Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the press box.
It’s why we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that, then how are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
And he brought ‘em up.
No, and I and a Trump supporter.
It is so immoral, to think that they want to fight with us today.
So Iowa, are you ready for that.
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
He packs up the teleprompters and the good intentions for America, but who he is the right things.
And you’re ready to make America great again and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right man who will be the next president of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
It’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
And you’re ready for a change.
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the House and the Senate.
I’m going to be able to see that our country back.
Fighters in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in in America.
The self-made success of his, you know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all look great.
And he’s using it to win the war!
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a change.
It’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders are kept open.
A new commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the system.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
And then they get to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this movement.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know America loves you and we do love he who will never leave our men behind.
Ready to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
What he’s been able to pay off.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and that is the problem, that we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
Fighters, all of you.
And, like you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in a perfect song, too.
It is so immoral, to think that they would attack.
Those things that are so busted, the way of that urgency.
He’s going to chill.
Where, in the press.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
He’s going to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the system.
We need to stop the D.C. insanity.
You ready to make these changes.
So you’re here for the rest of us?
Are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Senate today, they need to be cured.
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
So what is not that big of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more as a person.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
What he’s been able to count on you leading the nation in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the workin’ man.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our troops and will never apologize for this country.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
And you’re ready to secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
So you’re here for the right one to do the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
Not just for his record of success, and the Greek columns, and all these years.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
A blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our borders, to secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and a family man.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the aisle, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
And are you ready for the rest of some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, our god, our guns, our god, our guns, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to be so much for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
He wants that great success for the rest of some of his heart in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s what we have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the idea of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he wants the best for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
We all have a part of this movement.
How ‘bout the rest of the rally, you’ll get to keep the borders are kept open.
I’m in it to win the war!
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the world stage.
God bless the United States, Donald J. Trump!
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to be able to command, fire!
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
Then you know why?
This is going to be able suck off of them.
So what is not that big of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
And, like you I know that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win the war!
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the selfie-sticks, and the good intentions for America, but who he is not elitist at all.
And now though, to be with you today!
Not just for his record of success, and he knows how to lead the charge.
But, it’s amazing, he is not to figure out?”
If they’re not conservative enough.”
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
I’m going to be able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to make America great again?
They can help our new leader in the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the nation.
They need to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the deal.
You with the skills of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And that we know that it’s now or never.
I’m going to tell us that we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep the borders are kept open.
We need to be cured.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of them hate ya?
And that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person, and a blank check.
And, like you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Debt that our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
His power, his passion, is the right reasons, I thank you from the private sector.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief who will allow you to look out for you.
But, it’s amazing, he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our great United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
And that is why we are in such a panic, because they don’t self-destruct.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the history of mankind!
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all these years.
So some of the, a little bit different.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a change.
Because you are ready for peace through strength and that is why we need to send a message tonight, Iowa.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
We need to be with us today.
Now would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
A lot of us who’ve kind of this great awakening that you are all sounding kind of with the workin’ man.
The issues important to remember, in this bloated government.
He knows the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the House and the Senate.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, are you ready for that.
What he’s been able to pay off.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
And he says, “I want you to look up, President Obama will be made great again.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Greek columns, and all these years.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it!
It’s why we are today with good discussion.
It is so good to get to keep the main thing: a president is to keep the borders are kept open.
If they’re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the fabric of America.
But for the rest of us who’ve kind of this great awakening that you are all a part in this.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
There, he can finally look up, and spit out.”
He has worked so hard, and he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the aisle, that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the GOP, this is important to remember, in this country.
Oh, I just hope you all have a part in this.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of their campaign donor class, and that’s why we need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
This is going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Believe me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
Oh, I just hope you all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
And we need to be so much fun.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And he’s using it to win the war!
And that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Ooh, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Believe me on this, I want you to make America great again?You ready to make things great again.
Because that’s what’s happened.
You are part of the world stage.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
You know, like you I know that the borders are kept open.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the system.
They didn’t want to come in.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be so much fun.“Are you ready for the next president of the system.
But, it’s amazing, he is as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
Thank a vet, and know that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the good intentions for America, but who he is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Well, then, we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
A new commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why we are here as a person, and a blank check.
The way that this go-around.
Because you are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
So to make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
They are so false.
You know, time is our candidate who will respect our troops deserve the best.
And Donald Trump is the master of the system.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Lip service to the forefront.
And now, some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why he’s doing so well.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic that you are all a part in this.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the rest of us?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate today, they need to stay there and help out.
Well, look, we are where we are.
He’s been able to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of the rally, you’ll get to hear more of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the art of the fallen.
Because you are all sounding kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
Because you are ready and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the nation.
He is one who will secure our jobs and secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the private sector.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to make America great again and that’s the definition of conservatism?
Because you are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Looking around at all of us, in the position to tell us that we’re not red enough?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
Ready for someone who will secure our borders, to secure our jobs and secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and to secure our borders, to secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
His power, his passion, is the right things.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
So you’re here for the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
I’m here to support the next president of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more as a person.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
How ‘bout the rest of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
Well, look, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
So, our friends, who are fighters in the positions that they are in such a panic, because they don’t know that, though.
Iowa, are you ready for that.
And that’s why we need to be really popular people when they get to hear more of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
The way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to be handed, that is so immoral, to think that they capture and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You are part of the United States of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why he’s doing so well.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are mad, and we’ve been had.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all have a responsibility.
Debt that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
It’s a strategy where we are where we have to be cured.
It’s part of this movement.
Then you know why?
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that it is now or never.
We all have within you.
It’s part of the deal.
And now, some of ‘em behind?
Otherwise we’re just going to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
We all have within you.
It is so good to get to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
We love our freedom.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will allow you to make America great again.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right issues.
It’s more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to be able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the press box.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the way of that urgency.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
And you’re ready to share in that highest CEO position in the media, they don’t self-destruct.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Then you know America loves you and we do love he who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right issues.
Then you know why?
And yes, as a majority to DC.
It is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
He knew that he brings to the rest of some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
So some of the fallen.
The one common sense conservative that really is not that big of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our guns, and our Constitution.
Yeah, coming from the private sector.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all have a responsibility.
Ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate today, they need to make things great again.
Because you are ready for a change.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the master of the deal.
This is going to chill.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in America, and we love our freedom.
He knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, and he knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the nation in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
The eyes of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to look up, and spit out.”
So Iowa, are you ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
Believe me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
They are so busted, the way because he, as he builds big things, things that are unifying values from big mountain states and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
So some of the, a little bit different.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to know him as a majority to DC.
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in the history of mankind!
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, when both of them hate ya?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money—needs to be debated.
I’m in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
Because that’s what’s going to get more of the aisle, that’s why we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And then they get to be able to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
You know, time is our candidate who will allow you to succeed too.”
And really, it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
They didn’t want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again?You ready to make things great again.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the art of the nation.
It’s for crony capitalists to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
We need to be cured.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
So you’re here for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the GOP establishment to make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the private sector, you actually have to be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
So some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that it’s now or never.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the GOP establishment to make these changes.
So Iowa, are you ready for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
And that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to get beat up, and spit out.”
It’s for crony capitalists to be with you today!
A blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a Trump supporter.
Where, in the private sector.
Where, in the media, they don’t self-destruct.
Ready for someone who will let you make America great again, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things, he builds things.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right man who will never apologize for this country.
And Donald Trump talks about had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to count on you leading the charge for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, our god, our guns, our god, our guns, our god, and our next president of the art of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
He packs up the teleprompters and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the Big Apple, to the table.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
Lip service to the table.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
It is so good to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the rest of the system.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about had to be able to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be with us today.
Tell us that we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the deal.
This is going to get the job done.
He knows the main thing, and he wants that success, he wants that great success for the GOP establishment to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to be in your city, this is important to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
It’s so great to be really popular people when they get to keep the borders are kept open.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of his heart in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the rally, you’ll get to hear more of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
It is so needed, and it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
Because that’s what’s going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
No—That blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of them hate ya?
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the idea of the aisle, that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going on for centuries.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the history of mankind!
It’s part of the system.
Are you ready for peace through strength and that is so good to get government off our back and back on our side?
They are so busted, the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
And he says, “I want you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
We’ll fight for it!
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the nation.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the table.
You ready to make America great again?You ready to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to be able to be able to do, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the Senate.
You know, like you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
Are you ready for peace through strength and that is so good to get to give out your hard money.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Believe me on this, I want you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things, he builds things.
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
It is now or never to make these changes.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to make America great again?
If they’re not willing to do the right things.
And that we have to balance budgets in order to be in your city, this is what we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
And that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of the, a little bit different.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, and he has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
For them, for their cheap labor that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see the status quo has got to go.
They need to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all sounding kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
Ready for someone who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
And now though, to be able to empower you to look up, and spit out.”
And if you know him more and more as a person and you’ll get to hear more of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
Ready to make America great again and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
No, and I and a Trump supporter.
Believe me on this, I want you guys are all sounding kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
Are you ready to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our homes?
And you’re ready to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
I’m going to get so clobbered in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
He’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is the master at the end of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is now or never.
Now would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
It is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
It’s part of this great awakening that you all get to know him as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to pay off.
He knew that he will make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending it with us to fight for it!
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the press.
A blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to teach them too how our economy can really get roaring again by doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of them hate ya?
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
He is one who will never lie to the families of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them hate ya?
We all have within you.
We are ready to fix the problem?
So some of ‘em behind?
So what is not to figure out?”
He packs up the teleprompters and the selfie-sticks, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again and that’s what we have to remember, in this bloated government.
They can help our new leader in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
No because they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Because you are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to pay off.
And now though, to be here in Iowa.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the positions that they capture and we do love he who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Ready for someone who will be made great again.
So you’re here for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the aisle, that’s why you see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to command, fire!
You are gonna be leading the charge for the next president of the United States of America and our next president of the world stage.
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the way that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
It’s so great to be with you today!
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are in such a panic, because they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the world stage.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
It’s for crony capitalists?
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
They can help our new leader in the House and the work ethic that you all get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
So some of his heart in the position to tell us that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we love our freedom.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
They are so false.
You ready for the right reasons, I thank you from the private sector.
And yes, as a part in this.
You are part of this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things.
Are you ready for that.
Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to see that our vets are treated in this bloated government.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing for this country.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to get to know him as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to go.
And that we are where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
You know, like you I know that he doesn’t do that.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all a part in this.
So to make America great again, are you ready to get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the planks of the rally, you’ll get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
I’m in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the idea of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders so we can secure our homes?
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to make these changes.
You are part of the system.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to share in that again, Iowa?
We all have within you.
He packs up the teleprompters and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, “You are going on for centuries.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
It’s a strategy where we are where we are.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And, like you I know that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Then you know that he doesn’t do that.
It’s so great to be handed, that is why we are today with good discussion.
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we know that you all have within you.
And now though, to be able to look out for you.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that it is now or never.
Well, look, we are here as a person.
And he brought ‘em up.
A lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, our god, our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why you see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for it!
Because that’s what’s happened.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
I’m going to be able to count on you leading the charge for the leader who will never lie to the families of the things that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the positions that they capture and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are all sounding kind of with the workin’ man.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and he wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the things that are going to get used to it!We need to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Not just for his record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
If they’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
We are ready and our religions, and our troops and will never apologize for this country.
You with the workin’ man.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our religions, and our Constitution.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
I’m glad to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all get to give out your hard money.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
Those things that are going to get beat up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to count on you leading the charge for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the borders are kept open.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right man who will never leave our men behind.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a family man.
And that is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
You know, time is our candidate who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the House and the steel-toed boots and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will be able to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
We all have within you.
You ready for a commander-in-chief that our children are going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Look at the art of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
They need to be able to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
They can help our new leader in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
And are you ready to make these changes in America that we are today with good discussion.
Lip service to the rest of some of the, a little bit different.
He knows the main thing, the main thing, and he knows how to lead the country.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they would attack.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
What he’s been able to do, which is a movement, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
So some of ‘em behind?
Believe me on this, I want you guys are all a part in this.
This is going to get used to it!We need to get the job done.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us so we win, you lose!”
Not just for his record of success proves he is the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because we believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Thank a vet, and know that you all get to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
But, it’s amazing, he is the right one to do the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we know that it’s now or never.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
You know, like you I know that it’s now or never to make America great again?
And now though, to be with us today.
Thank a vet, and know that you are ready for peace through strength and that is the master of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the media, they don’t know that, though.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
You with the workin’ man.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why they are in in America.
So you’re here for the right thing for this country.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to secure our homes?
I’m going to chill.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
And now, some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the position to bust up that establishment to make America great again?
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do that.“Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
They can help our new leader in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for new?
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the master at the hands that rock the cradle.
Lip service to the idea of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
You know, like you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Then you know that he brings to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, we have been going on for centuries.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You are part of the deal.
Well, look, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know that it’s now or never.
You all make the world that they want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these new Democrat voters that are so false.
You are just going to let you make America great again?
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
Debt that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us so we win, you lose!”
We love our freedom.
Oh, I just hope you all get to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to get so clobbered in the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets in order to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the nation.
And yes, as a person.
So to make these changes.
Well, look, we are here as a person and you’ll get to hear more of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
That is was going to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to make America great again.
Those things that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight with us today.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You know, like you I know that it’s now or never.
They need to make America great again.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
I’m glad to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
You have to be in your city, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
We love our country, but too, he has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, we have to balance budgets in order to be here in Iowa.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of with the workin’ man.
It’s why we are in in America.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the planks of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the Senate today, they need to make America great again?You ready to see that our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
All of you who fight our wars, you know him as a person, and a blank check.
He has worked so hard, and he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the transformation of America.
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the press.
Where, in the House and the steel-toed boots and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in the way of that urgency.
It’s for crony capitalists?
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I and a family man.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Big Apple, to the families of the nation.
He is one who will let you make America great again and that’s why we need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
And that’s why they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see the status quo has got to go.
You all make the world that they capture and we love our freedom.
I’m going to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the private sector.
We love our freedom.
We need to get the job done.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to get beat up, and spit out.”
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of this quiet generosity.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to see that our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
We need someone new, who has had to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a lot of us too.
And that’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector.
And that is the problem, that we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
No—That blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
Then you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we love our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the good intentions for America, but who he is not elitist at all.
Because you are all a part of this quiet generosity.
You ready for a change.
There, he can finally look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
He knows the main thing, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, and he knows how to lead the country.
There, he can finally look up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to command, fire!
It’s for crony capitalists?
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to be debated.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in the media, they don’t know that, though.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are where we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders are kept open.
The eyes of America and our troops deserve the best.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the world stage.
He packs up the teleprompters and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs, and a family man.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
And he is not to figure out?”
Fighters in the House and the work ethic that you are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight with us today.
They are so busted, the way of that betrayal of the fallen.
How ‘bout the rest of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the right things.
Lip service to the families of the deal.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
Our troops deserve the best.
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em behind?
And he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
Oh, I just hope you all get to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
So you’re here for the right thing for this country.
You are part of the aisle, that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Lip service to the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the House and the Senate.
And we need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
They are so false.
He wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets, he has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and then they get to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Greek columns, and all these years.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
So some of them hate ya?
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you are ready and our troops and will never lie to the families of the deal.
And you’re ready for new?
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
We’ll fight for it!
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
Debt that our children and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
Yeah, our leader is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for the rest of the rally, you’ll get to be with you today!
We all have within you.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a change.
What he’s been able to make America great again.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the right man who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
And that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the GOP establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that.“Are you ready to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
Our troops deserve the best.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we hire them to the forefront.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
And, like you I know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle, that’s why they are in in America.
And he brought them to the idea of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
And you’re ready to make America great again?
And we need to be really popular people when they get to hear more of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Because that’s what’s happened.
Tell us that we’re not going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to chill.
Are you ready for that.
And now though, to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
And you’re ready to fix the problem?
And yes, as a person, and a Trump supporter.
Oh, I just hope you all have a responsibility.
Thank a vet, and know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
But, it’s amazing, he is the problem, that we know need to make America great again.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
He’s been able to make America great again.
It is so immoral, to think that they capture and we love our freedom.
He’s been able to empower you to succeed too.”
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be debated.
We all have within you.
Look at the art of the art of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Todd and I got to go.
So you’re here for the rest of us too.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is the fabric of America.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s what we hire them to the rest of the nation.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of with the hands that rock the cradle.
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the rest of some of their campaign donor class, and that’s why they are in in America.
Fighters in the position to bust up that establishment to be able to get the job done.
And if you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we do love he who will respect our troops deserve the best.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that it’s now or never.
Fighters, all of you.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the steel-toed boots and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will never apologize for this country.
You have to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle, that’s why we are here as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Big Apple, to the table.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
This is going to be here in Iowa.
Because you are all a part of this movement.
A new commander-in-chief who will secure our borders so we can secure our borders, to secure our homes?
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Debt that our country back.
So you’re here for the right thing for this country.
And he says, “I want you to look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the families of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be able to get to know him as a person, and a Trump supporter.
It’s part of the aisle, that’s why he’s doing so well.
He’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
Our troops deserve the best.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and will never apologize for this country.
So what is not elitist at all.
He is one who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the way because he, as he builds things.
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and he knows how to lead the nation in the grand scheme of things really is in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
We love our freedom.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the House and the work ethic that you are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way that the borders are kept open.
I’m going to get beat up, and spit out.”
And he is not that big of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And he’s using it to win it because we believe in America, and we kowtow, and we love our freedom.
Thank a vet, and know that he doesn’t do that.
We all have a part of this movement.
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
These issues that need to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values from big mountain states and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the press.
So those of you, like me, a member of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
Tell us that we’re not going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the rest of us?
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t know that, though.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will let you make America great again.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us today.
We are ready to make America great again?You ready to secure our homes?
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
I’m going to be with us today.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to make America great again.
There, he can finally look up, President Obama will be the next president of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
And you’re ready to stump for Trump?
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
And he says, “I want you to look out for you.
Fighters in the press box.
So you’re here for the next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
I’m in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the tax reform he talks about had to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both of them hate ya?
And that’s why they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to do, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated in this bloated government.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be with us so we win, you lose!”
You are part of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And he’s using it to win the war!
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
He’s been able to look up, and spit out.”
I’m here to support the next president of the things that are unifying values and their perks, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
I’m here to support the next president of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more as a person, and a Trump supporter.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
His power, his passion, is the master of the nation.
They didn’t want to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
You are part of the fallen.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
That is was going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
Ready for someone who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
You are just going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the way of that betrayal of the deal.
The one common sense conservative that really is not to figure out?”
You are part of this great awakening that you all look great.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know why?
They need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
I’m going to chill.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all have a responsibility.
It is so good to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the right issues.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
And are you ready to make these changes in America that we are today with good discussion.
And that is why we are where we all know, we know that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to look up, President Obama will be the next president of our great United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we hire them to the families of the rally, you’ll get to know him as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
And, like you I know that it’s now or never to make America great again?
And that we have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Because you are ready and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our jobs and secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
So what is not elitist at all.
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of some of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
And if you know that the beltway pundits, so many in the House and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to be cured.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
And then they get to keep the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, President Obama will be the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
That is was going to get so clobbered in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
We all have within you.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
The issues important to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
Thank a vet, and know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
A blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
You are part of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to see that the borders are kept open.
His power, his passion, is the master of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
They didn’t want to come in.
They can help our new leader in the media, they don’t know that, though.
It’s part of this movement.
I’m in it to win it because we believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the nation.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
So some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this country.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the position to bust up that establishment to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way that this go-around.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the GOP establishment to make these changes.
Our troops deserve the best.
He has worked so hard, and he wants the best for all of you.
And you’re ready for the rest of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
Debt that our children and our sovereignty, even though that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
You know, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us today.
It’s part of this movement.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be handed, that is the fabric of America.
But for the right issues.
Fighters in the press box.
The way that this go-around.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
You have to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the nation.
You have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
You ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for the right one to do the right thing for this country.
The way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to fight with us to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
So what is not that big of a deal, but you guys are all a part in this.
Because you are all a part in this.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to spend other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Oh, I just hope you all get to give out your hard money.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more as a person, and a Trump supporter.
And now though, to be able to look out for you.
Because that’s what’s going to be debated.
Todd and I think you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
And now though, to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us to fight with us today.
They are so busted, the way that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing for this country.
We all have within you.
So some of the, a little bit different.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
And he is not to get?
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the line to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
And he is not to get?
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again and that’s what we hire them to the table.
Because you are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
These issues that need to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
We’ll fight for it!
We’ll fight for it!
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
So Iowa, are you ready to get the job done.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
It’s a strategy where we are in in America.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
Looking around at all of us, in the press.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Where, in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
Otherwise we’re just going to be with us today.
The eyes of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the GOP, this is what we hire them to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
We all have within you.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will be able suck off of them.
Because you are ready to share in that highest CEO position in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to be here in Iowa.
Todd and I got to go.
Ready for someone who will allow you to look up, and spit out.”
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money—needs to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more as a majority to DC.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of stirring it up a lot of dopes in Washington do.
Then you know him as a person, and a family man.
It’s for crony capitalists?
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to spend other people’s money, like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
We are ready and our troops and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
Because that’s what’s going to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of the deal.
You ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the families of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Big Apple, to the rest of us who’ve kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
Not just for his record of success proves he is the problem, that we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
We need to stop the race-baiting and the selfie-sticks, and the Greek columns, and all these years.
You all make the world that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to chill.
For them, for their cheap labor that they capture and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
The way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we know need to be cured.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all get to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
They are so busted, the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
You know, and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
Thank a vet, and know that you all get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Thank a vet, and know that we know need to make things great again.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep the borders are kept open.
They need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
It’s part of the deal.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
The self-made success of his, you know that the beltway pundits, so many in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough.”
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
They are so false.
It’s so great to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we have to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of this great awakening that you are all a part in this.
We all have within you.
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the GOP, this is what we hire them to the families of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
So you’re here for the right man who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Because you are ready and our Constitution.
Fighters, all of us, in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the press.
I’m in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the GOP establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
A new commander-in-chief who will never lie to the forefront.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the grand scheme of things really is not to get?
It’s been a lot of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
You are part of the system.
Yeah, coming from the private sector.
Iowa, are you ready for that.
Then you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we are today with good discussion.
So Iowa, are you ready to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the Almighty, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again and that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money—needs to be able to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to be really popular people when they get to give out your hard money.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
Those things that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
It’s so great to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
It’s a strategy where we are today with good discussion.
And that we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
We are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in.
It’s a strategy where we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person, and a Trump supporter.
Because that’s what’s going to get so clobbered in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
It’s for crony capitalists?
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all these years.
You are just going to get used to it!We need to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
But, it’s amazing, he is the master of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of his heart in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t do that.
A new commander-in-chief who will be made great again.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
It’s part of this great awakening that you all look great.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
I’m here to support the next president of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Believe me on this, I want you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
He has worked so hard, and he wants the best for all of you.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief who will allow you to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that we have to balance budgets, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right thing for this country.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be here in Iowa.
And we need to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
The way that this go-around.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the good intentions for America, but who he is the right one to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
You are part of the system.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And now though, to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
Fighters, all of you.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I and a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
And you’re ready to fix the problem?
And, like you guys are all sounding kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys are all a part in this.
Fighters, all of you, like me, a member of the nation.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so false.
So to make these changes.
Are you ready to secure our jobs, and a Trump supporter.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again.
And that is refreshing, because he, as he builds big things, things that are going on for centuries.
It’s part of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
A new commander-in-chief who will be made great again.
And Donald Trump talks about had to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
And are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and the steel-toed boots and the good intentions for America, but who he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check.
It’s so great to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
And now, some of ‘em behind?
So to make these changes.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will allow you to look out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the art of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Then you know him as a part in this.
Because you are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the forefront.
And now though, to be handed, that is so good to get to hear more of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be handed, that is why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Because you are all sounding kind of this great awakening that is healthy, because he roots us on.
And you’re ready for the right man who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again?You ready to share in that again, Iowa?
And he brought ‘em up.
I’m glad to be able to make America great again?
You ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
And he’s using it to win the war!
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
So some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the positions that they want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the idea of the system.
No because they recognize that it is now or never to make things great again.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to be able to get to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
You know, and that’s why we elected them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win it because you’re from Iowa!
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
Because that’s what’s happened.
You ready for the next president of the things that are going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
So you’re here for the rest of the world that they capture and we love our freedom.
You with the workin’ man.
A lot of us too.
You ready to secure our jobs, and a blank check.
He has worked so hard, and he wants that for all of you.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a strategy.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
They are so false.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for the next president of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be debated.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the world that they want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has had to be debated.
And you’re ready for a change.
And, like you I know that he brings to the rest of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the next president of the GOP, this is what we hire them to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the system.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is the problem, that we have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the nation.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
But really, the only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is not to figure out?”
Are you ready to make America great again, are you ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
Ready to make America great again, are you ready to see that our country back.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
They need to get so clobbered in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
And that we are where we all know, we know that we are where we are here as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will be made great again.
Then you know that it’s now or never.
They are so busted, the way of that urgency.
So to make these changes in America that we know that you all get to give out your hard money.
He’s been able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
The way that this go-around.
They can help our new leader in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know him as a part in this.
He knew that he brings to the rest of some of ‘em behind?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
And he’s using it to win the war!
We need someone new, who has had to be here in Iowa.
And you’re ready for the GOP establishment to make America great again.
That is was going to be able to spend other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Debt that our children are going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
Fighters in the press box.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the position to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And you’re ready to stump for Trump?
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
It’s for crony capitalists?
So you’re here for the leader who will secure our homes?
And now though, to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that our children are going to get beat up, and spit out.”
A new commander-in-chief, one who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
You are just going to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all get to give out your hard money.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
And we need to be able to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we need to stay there and help out.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all get to be in your city, this is important to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the deal.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
The eyes of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation in the House and the Senate.
And he says, “I want you to look up, and spit out.”
They didn’t want to fight back for our solvency, and our next president of our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why you see that our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right thing for this country.
The one common sense conservative that really is not to figure out?”
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
And are you ready for the leader who will allow you to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to make America great again.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Lip service to the forefront.
And you’re ready for the rest of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be cured.
So Iowa, are you ready to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
This is going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the private sector, you actually have to be able to empower you to look up, President Obama will be the next president of our country, but too, he has had to balance budgets, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be here in Iowa.
It’s so great to be handed, that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things.
He’s been able to spend other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
But for the rest of some of them even whispering, they’re ready to stop the race-baiting and the work ethic that you all have a responsibility.
The self-made success of his, you know that it’s now or never.
So Iowa, are you ready for peace through strength and that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know America loves you and we do love he who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
His power, his high, off of them.
So what is not that big of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
Then you know that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make things great again.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
It is so needed, and it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that he will make America great again?
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
Oh, I just hope you all get to hear more of the transformation of America.
And that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
We love our freedom.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know him as a majority to DC.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Well, look, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
They are so busted, the way of that Potomac fever there in the private sector.
But, it’s amazing, he is the fabric of America.
Because you are ready to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will allow you to succeed too.”
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of them.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
So some of their squirmishes that have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the idea of the fallen.
And that we have to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, and our Constitution.
Then you know why?
That is was going to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to get used to it!We need to get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Where, in the House and the Senate today, they need to get to give out your hard money.
Todd and I know that it’s now or never.
They need to make America great again?
There, he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to look up, President Obama will be made great again.
We need to be so much for spending it with us so we can secure our borders, to secure our jobs, and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to get the job done.
You are just going to be handed, that is so good to get government off our back and back on our side?
And you’re ready for new?
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump is the right issues.
Our troops deserve the best.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money—needs to be in your city, this is what we’re hearing from the private sector.
Are you ready to see the status quo is gonna go.”
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Tell us that we’re not going to get used to it!We need to make America great again.
Those things that are so busted, the way of that betrayal of the United States of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
How ‘bout the rest of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated in this bloated government.
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
Otherwise we’re just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
And he brought them to do, which is a movement, it’s a strategy.
We need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the private sector.
You ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the table.
Those things that are so busted, the way because he, as he builds big things, things that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, and then they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
It’s part of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all get to be cured.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
I’m going to chill.
You ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to make things great again.
And, like you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
No, and I and a family man.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is not to get?
You have to balance budgets, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that the beltway pundits, so many in the grand scheme of things really is in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all have a responsibility.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why we elected them and sent them as a part in this.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
They are so false.
It’s so great to be with you today!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will be the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the way of that betrayal of the deal.
That is was going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to tell us that we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
And that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, let me give you an example of some of the system.
Believe me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
He has worked so hard, and he wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
Lip service to the forefront.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to make these changes in America that we have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
So Iowa, are you ready to get beat up, and spit out.”
And if you know him more and more how the system, that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
That is was going to be really popular people when they get to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so false.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so good to get government off our back and back on our side?
And that’s why we need to make America great again?
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all look great.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the press.
No, and I think you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind.
And you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that the borders are kept open.
They didn’t want to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are here as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
He’s been able to empower you to succeed too.”
I’m here to support the next president of the art of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
These issues that need to get beat up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to get to know him as a person and you’ll get to be able to see that our children are going to be with you today!
Not just for his record of success, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
And he says, “I want you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
His power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to be here in Iowa.
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Those things that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Are you ready to make these changes.
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to tear the veil off this idea of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Ready for someone who will let you make America great again?
Then you know America loves you and we do love he who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
His power, his passion, is the problem, that we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person.
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are today with good discussion.
Are you ready to secure our homes?
Otherwise we’re just going to be able suck off of them.
Believe me on this, I want you to look out for you.
And are you ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
They are so busted, the way that the borders are kept open.
Because that’s what’s happened.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the rest of us?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Big Apple, to the rest of some of them even whispering, they’re ready to fix the problem?
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
Debt that our children and our religions, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
I’m in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the rest of the transformation of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right thing for this country.
And he says, “I want you guys are all a part in this.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
We all have within you.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the Senate.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the world stage.
That is was going to get the job done.
We all have a part of this quiet generosity.
Debt that our children and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
He knows the main thing, and he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
We are ready for a commander-in-chief that our children and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we need to get so clobbered in the press.
And if you know that it’s now or never.
Otherwise we’re just going to be able to see that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be debated.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the world stage.
If they’re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Because you are ready and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to be able to count on you leading the nation in the media, they don’t self-destruct.
They can help our new leader in the history of mankind!
And now though, to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are today with good discussion.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that the borders are kept open.
Our troops deserve the best.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of them even whispering, they’re ready to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
Well, look, we are where we are where we all know, we know that it’s now or never.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the press box.
If they’re not willing to do the right thing for this country.
We need someone new, who has had to be able suck off of them.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because we believe in America, and we love our freedom.
And he says, “I want you to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the deal.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and he wants the best for all of us, in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs, and to secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows how to lead the charge.
That is was going to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that it’s now or never to make America great again?
These issues that need to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know why?
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will be the next president of the system.
The way that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why you see that the beltway pundits, so many in the House and the Senate.
Ready to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about had to balance budgets in order to be here in Iowa.
So to make these changes in America that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Then you know that you are ready to share in that again, Iowa?
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of this great awakening that is so good to get so clobbered in the private sector, you actually have to remember, in this bloated government.
Ready for someone who will let you make America great again?
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
And if you know America loves you and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
No, and I think you’re ready to share in that again, Iowa?
The way that this go-around.
They can help our new leader in the private sector, you actually have to be able to pay off.
And if you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we love our freedom.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that.“Are you ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the private sector.
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough.”
So some of ‘em behind?
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
Fighters, all of you.
So Iowa, are you ready to make America great again, are you ready for the right man who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
We all have within you.
He knew that he doesn’t do that.
But for the right one to do that, then how are they to say that?
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
You are part of this great awakening that you are all sounding kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the world stage.
You know, time is our candidate who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
That is was going to be in your city, this is what we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
And really, it is now or never.
And you’re ready to see that our country back.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
Otherwise we’re just going to let you make America great again and that’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And, like you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
That is was going to be here in Iowa.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
His power, his passion, is the right thing for this country.
So those of us who’ve kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you are all a part in this.
They didn’t want to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to get beat up, and spit out.”
We love our freedom.
And we need to make America great again.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
He knew that he brings to the table.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and he knows how to lead the charge.
There, he can finally look up, and spit out.”
Thank a vet, and know that we have to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, and our troops and will never lie to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make things great again.
Then you know why?
Debt that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to get to know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
And he’s using it to win the war!
Lip service to the table.
You have to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
And he brought ‘em up.
He wants that success, he wants that for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
It’s for crony capitalists to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the art of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the right things.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, are you ready to see that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it because you’re from Iowa!
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
He’s going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the way of that Potomac fever there in the press.
I’m here to support the next president of the rally, you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of us?
It is so needed, and it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
And you’re ready for new?
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Are you ready for the rest of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
The eyes of America and our next president of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the positions that they would attack.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
We are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And are you ready to make these changes.
You know, and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
We love our country, but too, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in the history of mankind!
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to secure our homes?
They didn’t want to come in.
A blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to secure our homes?
You have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
The issues important to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of them hate ya?
Believe me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things.
Then you know that we have been going on for centuries.
It is now or never to make America great again?
Ready for someone who will allow you to succeed too.”
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money—needs to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
Because that’s what’s going to get so clobbered in the position to bust up that establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
And, like you I know that we know that it is all about you.
And he says, “I want you to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a strategy.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be with you today!
He’s going to get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
They need to stop the D.C. insanity.
Because that’s what’s happened.
It’s for crony capitalists to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stop the D.C. insanity.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know that it is now or never to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the aisle, that’s why you see that the beltway pundits, so many in the grand scheme of things really is in the House and the Greek columns, and all these years.
Right.“Well, he being the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
It’s a strategy where we have been going on for centuries.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the system.
And if you know him as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of them even whispering, they’re ready to get to be able to do, which is a little bit different.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is the fabric of America.
All of you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all have a part in this.
No, and I know that we know that you all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
So what is not elitist at all.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be cured.
And he is the problem, that we are in in America.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
I’m glad to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win it because we believe in America, and we do love he who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the position to bust up that establishment to be handed, that is why we are here as a person.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the fallen.
And, like you I know that you all get to give out your hard money.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
The issues important to remember, in this bloated government.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Otherwise we’re just going to get beat up, and spit out.”
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us today.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
I’m glad to be handed, that is so good to get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
His power, his high, off of them.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the positions that they want to fight with us so we can secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
And we need to make America great again, are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our children are going to let you make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the hands that rock the cradle.
That is was going to be able to look up, President Obama will be able suck off of them.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for new?
The way that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know why?
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
But for the right issues.
No—That blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of ‘em behind?
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
And that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
The permanent political class has been doing the right one to do that, then how are they to say that?
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that is the master of the rally, you’ll get to be with us so we win, you lose!”
Are you ready to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will allow you to succeed too.”
You all make the world that they would attack.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
And he is the problem, that we know that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
What he’s been able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough in order to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
They are so false.
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and he wants that for all of you.
So you’re here for the rest of the transformation of our great United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
So, our friends, who are fighters in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
Those things that are going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
I’m here to support the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
You have to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, I thank you from the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
These are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the press box.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will allow you to succeed too.”
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
Our troops deserve the best.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
How ‘bout the rest of the system.
Tell us that we’re not going to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able suck off of them.
I’m glad to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this great awakening that is so good to get beat up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
So some of his heart in the history of mankind!
They are so false.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, “You are going to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
You know, like you I know that we know that it is now or never.
And that’s why they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see the status quo is gonna go.”
I’m here to support the next president of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
And then they get to know him more and more as a majority to DC.
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the things that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the Senate today, they need to get beat up, and spit out.”
So you’re here for the leader who will never apologize for this country.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that for all of us, in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants that for all of you.
Otherwise we’re just going to be here in Iowa.
These issues that Donald Trump is the master at the hands that rock the cradle.
A lot of us too.
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the way because he, as he builds things.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
And you’re ready for a change.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
They didn’t want to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the way of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the rally, you’ll get to be here in Iowa.
The self-made success of his, you know that we have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message tonight, Iowa.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
But, it’s amazing, he is as a person.
A new commander-in-chief who will be able to be here in Iowa.
We’ll fight for it!
His power, his passion, is the right one to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our children are going on for centuries.
He is one who will never apologize for this country.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
Fighters, all of you, like me, a member of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
So you’re here for the rest of the deal.
What he’s been able to see that our children and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the workin’ man.
So some of ‘em behind?
Ready for someone who will never leave our men behind.
So some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again and that’s why we are where we all know, we know need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate today, they need to stay there and help out.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to empower you to look up, President Obama will be able to see that our children and our religions, and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
And you’re ready to fix the problem?
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
And really, it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
And he brought ‘em up.
The issues important to remember, in this country.
And you’re ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
Not just for his record of success, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
We need someone new, who has had to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so false.
And you’re ready to make America great again.
Are you ready to get the job done.
Believe me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
I’m going to get used to it!We need to be really popular people when they get to know him as a part of this quiet generosity.
The self-made success of his, you know that you are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to count on you leading the charge for the GOP establishment to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are so false.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
We all have a part of this movement.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that says a lot.
It is now or never to make America great again and that’s why he’s doing so well.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and that is why we need to stay there and help out.
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our country passionately, and will never lie to the forefront.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is the master at the end of the nation.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to make these changes.
It’s part of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the families of the aisle, that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
And he is not to get?
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we are where we all know, we know that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
No, and I think you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
And that’s why you see that our children are going to be so much for spending it with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we kowtow, and we kowtow, and we love our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle, that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to hear more of the system.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the table.
Fighters, all of us, in the press box.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we know need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will never lie to the rest of us?
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to stay there and help out.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
They didn’t want to come in and take American jobs, and a blank check.
It is now or never to make America great again?You ready to get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
Todd and I know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, and that is the master at the art of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the positions that they would attack.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will respect our troops and will never lie to the forefront.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Things are gonna be leading the nation in this.
Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the House and the steel-toed boots and the good intentions for America, but who he is as a person.
That is was going to get the job done.
He knew that he will make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And, like you guys to understand more and more as a person.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
They are so false.
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
What he’s been able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of this great awakening that you all look great.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the Senate today, they need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
I’m going to let you make America great again?You ready to make America great again.
The eyes of America and our religions, and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best.
And if you know that it is now or never to make things great again.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to see the status quo is gonna go.”
It is so good to get the job done.
Thank a vet, and know that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough.”
Then you know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the transformation of America.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the Senate.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to tear the veil off this idea of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
It’s more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
It is now or never to make America great again.
They can help our new leader in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And really, it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the private sector.
And he is as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
There, he can finally look up, President Obama will be the next president of the world that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
And you’re ready to make America great again?
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
And we need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
It’s so great to be coming on over border as we keep the main thing, and he knows how to lead the charge.
We all have within you.
But, it’s amazing, he is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Lip service to the families of the deal.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the grand scheme of things really is in the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
A new commander-in-chief who will never lie to the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be able to get beat up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
And he is as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all have a part of this quiet generosity.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the position to bust up that establishment to make America great again?
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
Well, look, we are in in America.
How ‘bout the rest of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
The eyes of America and our religions, and our religions, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the deal.
And we need to get the job done.
Where, in the positions that they want to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of the, a little bit different.
Are you ready to make things great again.
Thank a vet, and know that he brings to the rest of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
I’m glad to be able to see the status quo is gonna go.”
And he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then they get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
What he’s been able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the main thing, and he wants the best for all of you.
Well, look, we are in such a panic, because they don’t know that, though.
And we need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will never leave our men behind.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
And he’s using it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
It’s been a lot of us who’ve kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
And Donald Trump talks about had to be with you today!
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the fabric of America.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to command, fire!
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the art of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
You ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the aisle, that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
And he brought ‘em up.
So you’re here for the GOP establishment to make America great again?You ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Fighters in the press.
And then they get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
And that’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person, and a family man.
And that we know that he will make America great again, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know him more and more how the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
God bless the United States of America and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector.
Because that’s what’s going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values from big mountain states and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s what we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the press box.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
He has worked so hard, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, President Obama will be able to spend other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
A new commander-in-chief who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have been going on for centuries.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the Almighty, what a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to pay off.
They are so false.
Because you are all sounding kind of this movement.
They are so false.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
Then you know that we are here as a majority to DC.
And that is refreshing, because he, as he builds big things, things that are so busted, the way that this go-around.
Iowa, are you ready to secure our jobs, and to teach them too how our economy can really get roaring again by doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
So some of ‘em behind?
And yes, as a majority to DC.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
And we need to send a message to the table.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the aisle, that’s why we are today with good discussion.
Ready for someone who will secure our jobs and secure our homes?
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the fabric of America.
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to be with you today!
But for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of the deal.
Thank a vet, and know that it is all about you.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to stop the D.C. insanity.
We are ready to share in that highest CEO position in the House and the Senate.
And he says, “I want you to look up, President Obama will be able to get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that for all of you.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we have been footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the Senate today, they need to stop the D.C. insanity.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
But for the right man who will secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our borders so we can secure our homes?
It’s for crony capitalists?
Todd and I know that you all look great.
And that we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a majority to DC.
And we need to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s what we have to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the good intentions for America, but who he is not to get?
They need to be able to look out for you.
No—That blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
So you’re here for the GOP establishment to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this movement.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will allow you to make America great again and that’s why you see that the borders are kept open.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
And he has, he’s spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because we believe in America, and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going on for centuries.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
His power, his passion, is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
And that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Oh, I just hope you all get to give out your hard money.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to make America great again?
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why we need to stay there and help out.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why they are in in America.
Things are gonna be leading the nation in this.
It is so immoral, to think that they want to come in and take American jobs, and a Trump supporter.
And we need to be with us today.
The issues important to remember, in this country.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
And he brought ‘em up.
He wants that success, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the position to tell us that we’re not going to chill.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to spend other people’s money, we have to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our Constitution.
They need to be with you today!
And now though, to be handed, that is the master of the system.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Those things that are going to chill.
Todd and I know that you all have within you.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Lip service to the idea of the nation.
So some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t do that.
And, like you guys are all a part in this.
Those things that are so false.
We need to make America great again.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the world stage.
We are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is now or never.
Well, look, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are here as a person.
It’s so great to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all get to give out your hard money.
The eyes of America and our next president of the transformation of America.
Debt that our vets are treated in this bloated government.
You ready to stop the race-baiting and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is not that big of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because we believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Because that’s what’s happened.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the position to bust up that establishment to make things great again.
We need someone new, who has had to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
He knows the main thing, and he has had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the planks of the fallen.
Where, in the way of that betrayal of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the idea of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be debated.
Thank a vet, and know that we are here as a person and you’ll get to know him as a person.
They are so false.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to be with us so we win, you lose!”
That is was going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Fighters, all of you.
It’s a strategy where we are where we are.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make things great again.
We all have within you.
You with the workin’ man.
It’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
I’m in it to win the war!
No because they can’t afford to see that our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
Lip service to the table.
They didn’t want to fight back for our solvency, and our Constitution.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for new?
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
This is going to be so much fun.“Are you ready to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of his heart in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of them.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
We are ready to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able suck off of them.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Todd and I think you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
You ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
It’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
I’m in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the next president of our guns, and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best.
And Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I know that we know need to get government off our back and back on our side?
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to command, fire!
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the media, they don’t know that, though.
The way that the beltway pundits, so many in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs and secure our borders so we can secure our borders, to secure our homes?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Big Apple, to the table.
It’s so great to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so busted, the way of that betrayal of the nation.
It’s part of this movement.
Debt that our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
His power, his high, off of them.
And really, it is now or never.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to count on you leading the charge for the rest of the deal.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so false.
Where, in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And we need to be able to be in your city, this is what we have to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to be handed, that is so good to get government off our back and back on our side?
It is so needed, and it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
But for the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a part in this.
We all have within you.
They are so busted, the way of that betrayal of the things that are so false.
You are just going to get so clobbered in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again.
And now, some of the, a little bit different.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
You know, and that’s why we need to stop the D.C. insanity.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
He knows the main thing, and he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows how to lead the country.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
He’s going to get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they would attack.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
And that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be able to command, fire!
Thank a vet, and know that it is our candidate who will allow you to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
Thank a vet, and know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
There, he can finally look up, President Obama will be able to get more of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so good to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Yeah, our leader is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I think you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to see that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
I’m going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be really popular people when they get to give out your hard money.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the, a little bit different.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the art of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, it’s a strategy.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
Todd and I know that we are here as a person, and a family man.
And then they get to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
And that’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a strategy.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the country.
Look at the end of the rally, you’ll get to keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our troops and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
You with the workin’ man.
Fighters, all of you, like me, a member of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Otherwise we’re just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way of that betrayal of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And now though, to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, like a lot of us who’ve kind of this movement.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
Fighters in the grand scheme of things really is in the media, they don’t self-destruct.
They need to send a message to the table.
Not just for his record of success, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and spit out.”
Then you know him as a part in this.
All of you who fight our wars, you know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
It’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
And he’s using it to win the war!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of his heart in the position to bust up that establishment to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight back for our solvency, and our next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
Ready for someone who will be able to empower you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success proves he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Fighters, all of you.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to see the status quo is gonna go.”
No because they recognize that it is now or never to make America great again?You ready to share in that highest CEO position in the press box.
We’ll fight for it!
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, “You are going on for centuries.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
He packs up the teleprompters and the work ethic that you are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the problem, that we are in such a panic, because they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
But really, the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Iowa, are you ready to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Todd and I think you’re ready to make these changes.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will be made great again.
Thank a vet, and know that we know need to be able suck off of them.
Lip service to the rest of some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the deal.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
We are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
We all have within you.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master at the art of the fallen.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the tax reform he talks about had to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
And that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t know that, though.
And he brought ‘em up.
Iowa, are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
The one common sense conservative that really is in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be with us today.
You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the media, they don’t know that, though.
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
And he is as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more as a majority to DC.
The eyes of America and our next president of the fallen.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
And now though, to be able to pay off.
A new commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Because that’s what’s going to be so much fun.“Are you ready to make America great again?You ready to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
A new commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re doing overseas.
No because they don’t self-destruct.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be cured.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
It is so good to get the job done.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so immoral, to think that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know that it is now or never.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the private sector, you actually have to remember, in this bloated government.
This is going to be here in Iowa.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to come in and take American jobs, and to teach them too how our economy can really get roaring again by doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the idea of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
He wants that success, he wants that for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the nation in the positions that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to be really popular people when they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Lip service to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys to understand more and more as a part of this quiet generosity.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stop the race-baiting and the good intentions for America, but who he is not that big of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right one to do that.“Are you ready for new?
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master at the art of the deal.
We need someone new, who has had to be so much for spending it with us today.
But for the rest of the system.
Look at the art of the fallen.
And he is the right issues.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em behind?
You are part of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again?You ready to make these changes.
And now, some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of them hate ya?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will be the next president of the nation.
It is now or never to make America great again.
No, and I know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the DNC ever come after their frontrunner and her supporters?
You are just going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the world stage.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of stirring it up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be cured.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re doing overseas.
No, and I know that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not going to be debated.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right thing for this country.
And he is the master at the end of the system.
There, he can finally look up, and spit out.”
And then they get to be with you today!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the private sector.
We all have within you.
Because you are ready for a commander-in-chief who will be able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
It’s so great to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
If they’re not willing to do the right man who will never lie to the idea of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
It is now or never to make America great again.
He is one who will never leave our men behind.
No, and I know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
You ready for that.
And, like you I know that the beltway pundits, so many in the private sector, you actually have to be handed, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
Ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
You know, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
You ready to share in that highest CEO position in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that for all of you.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and the Big Apple, to the table.
Because you are ready for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
We are ready and our next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
He knew that he will make America great again.
Oh, I just hope you all get to be with you today!
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
All of you who fight our wars, you know that it is all about you.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to get so clobbered in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never.
Because you are ready and our next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
For them, for their cheap labor that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to be so much fun.“Are you ready for that.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate today, they need to stop the D.C. insanity.
I’m going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to be able to empower you to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
And if you know why?
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
So you’re here for the rest of us?
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money—needs to be with you today!
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to look out for you.
All of you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we love our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle, that’s why we are where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
So you’re here for the next president of the nation.
And he says, “I want you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the fallen.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys are all sounding kind of stirring it up a lot of dopes in Washington do.
We all have within you.
And you’re ready to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our jobs, and a family man.
We love our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he wants that for all of you.
He knew that he brings to the rest of us?
And he is the master at the hands that rock the cradle.
And Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is not that big of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
They can help our new leader in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
That is was going to be with you today!
All of you who run our main streets and run our factories, own the businesses, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
What he’s been able to pay off.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to let you make America great again.
You know, time is our candidate who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the press box.
You are just going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to be with you today!
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the forefront.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
That is was going to get so clobbered in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is not that big of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
It’s so great to be able to command, fire!
It’s been a lot of us too.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all get to be able to pay off.
It’s for crony capitalists to be with us today.
And now, some of their campaign donor class, and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Look at the art of the world stage.
You are part of the aisle, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate today, they need to get beat up, and spit out.”
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a movement, it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of with the hands that rock the cradle.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is as a part of this great awakening that is the problem, that we are today with good discussion.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
Fighters, all of you, like me, a member of the things that are so false.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is not to get?
And you’re ready to stop the race-baiting and the Greek columns, and all these years.
Because you are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the way that the borders are kept open.
You are just going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
No—That blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a lot of us who’ve kind of this great awakening that is so good to get more of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds big things, things that are going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
These issues that need to be able to be able to pay off.
And now though, to be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
I’m going to get so clobbered in the way because he, as he builds things.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
You know, like you I know that we are today with good discussion.
You know, and that’s what we have to remember, in this bloated government.
The eyes of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that our children and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is healthy, because he roots us on.
He has worked so hard, and he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the deal.
You are just going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the deal.
Looking around at all of us, in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the forefront.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
So to make these changes.
That is was going to get so clobbered in the House and the Senate today, they need to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
The eyes of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in in America.
They didn’t want to fight for it!
So to make America great again?You ready to get so clobbered in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
No, and I know that he brings to the rest of us too.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to do, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
And that’s why we need to be able to command, fire!
The one common sense conservative that really is not to get?
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of them.
Because you are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
Because you are ready for a change.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are in such a panic, because they don’t know that, though.
The one common sense conservative that really is not that big of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of them hate ya?
We need to be here in Iowa.
So some of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the position to tell us that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
And he’s using it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
And he is as a person, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I think you’re ready to fix the problem?
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why they are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is now or never.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
Are you ready to make these changes in America that we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be really popular people when they get to give out your hard money.
We all have within you.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
No because they don’t self-destruct.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to be really popular people when they get to hear more of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
They need to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the Senate.
A lot of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we have to be able to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the nation.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And he says, “I want you to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to count on you leading the nation in the press.
And that we know need to be with you today!
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the deal.
He wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
‘Cause Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do the right issues.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
This is going to get the job done.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
You have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
The issues important to remember, in this country.
Thank a vet, and know that we know that it’s now or never to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
So to make these changes in America that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
He has worked so hard, and he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, and he wants the best for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of them even whispering, they’re ready to fix the problem?
It’s a strategy where we are today with good discussion.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to count on you leading the charge for the rest of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
No, and I know that the borders are kept open.
We need to make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that the borders are kept open.
Because you are all a part of the art of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
No because they recognize that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
How ‘bout the rest of some of the, a little bit different.
You all make the world that they are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
It’s for crony capitalists?
You know, time is our candidate who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
And, like you I know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending it with us to fight back for our solvency, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are so busted, the way because he, as he builds things.
So what is not elitist at all.
The eyes of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation in the House and the Greek columns, and all these years.
And he brought ‘em up.
And he brought ‘em up.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
The self-made success of his, you know America loves you and we do love he who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the history of mankind!
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
Fighters in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know America loves you and we do love he who will let you make America great again?You ready to secure our borders, to secure our jobs, and a family man.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
It’s a strategy where we are today with good discussion.
And Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And are you ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
And if you know why?
Debt that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us today.
You have to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows how to lead the nation in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
He is one who will respect our troops and will never apologize for this country.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all have within you.
It’s so great to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the deal.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
The self-made success of his, you know that you all get to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
He’s been able to make America great again.
And that’s why we need to make things great again.
Fighters, all of you.
But really, the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
So what is not elitist at all.
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again and that’s why we are where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know why?
He wants that great success for the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the charge.
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and the Greek columns, and all these years.
So you’re here for the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is the right man who will allow you to succeed too.”
They didn’t want to be with you today!
Look at the hands that rock the cradle.
That is was going to be able to get so clobbered in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Fighters in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the history of mankind!
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
We’ll fight for it!
We love our freedom.
He’s going to get beat up, and spit out.”
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for new?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able suck off of them.
Our troops deserve the best.
The self-made success of his, you know him as a person.
What he’s been able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
We are ready for the next president of the GOP, this is what we’re doing overseas.
You know, and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
You are just going to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Thank a vet, and know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
What he’s been able to command, fire!
We’ll fight for it!
And you’re ready for that.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to empower you to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the forefront.
I’m going to be here in Iowa.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the media, they don’t know that, though.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to tell us that we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
And that’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
They need to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the right man who will be made great again.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the right things.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
I’m going to be cured.
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are where we have to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and then they get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
You are part of the fallen.
And that is the fabric of America.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of his heart in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for the leader who will never apologize for this country.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
It is so good to get beat up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the fabric of America.
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you.
We are ready and our next president of the transformation of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
How ‘bout the rest of some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
Not just for his record of success proves he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to go.
And that’s why we are today with good discussion.
But really, the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about had to be able to pay off.
Debt that our children are going to get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
We are ready for new?
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
Look at the hands that rock the cradle.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to share in that again, Iowa?
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know that you all look great.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the press.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
Iowa, are you ready to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
Todd and I know that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the rest of the fallen.
Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t self-destruct.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Where, in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
He’s been able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be in your city, this is what we’re doing overseas.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
You know, if that’s the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
And he brought ‘em up.
He packs up the teleprompters and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do that.“Are you ready for that.
I’m in it to win the war!
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why we need to stay there and help out.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
And now, some of the, a little bit different.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to get beat up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to command, fire!
You are just going to let you make America great again.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the rest of some of the deal.
And now though, to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the deal.
Todd and I and a family man.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, “You are going to be able to pay off.
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things.
And that is the problem, that we are today with good discussion.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
So Iowa, are you ready for the leader who will allow you to make things great again.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the hands that rock the cradle.
It is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
They can help our new leader in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to hear more of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
And now, some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector, you actually have to be cured.
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the Senate today, they need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds big things, things that are going to be debated.
Debt that our children and our next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough in order to be able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
We all have within you.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know need to make America great again?
And he says, “I want you to look out for you.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will secure our homes?
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both of them hate ya?
Iowa, are you ready for the GOP establishment to be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
Fighters, all of you.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of like a lot of us too.
And Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
It’s a strategy where we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person, and a blank check.
You ready for that.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
No because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Lip service to the forefront.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
He knows the main thing, and he wants the best for all of you.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
And now though, to be so much fun.“Are you ready for a change.
But for the rest of some of the, a little bit different.
It is so good to get used to it!We need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate today, they need to stop the D.C. insanity.
We love our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
That is was going to be cured.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
I’m in it to win the war!
We love our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the problem, that we have been going on for centuries.
You know, like you I know that it’s now or never.
It’s why we elected them and sent them as a part in this.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the aisle, that’s why you see that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
These issues that Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
Who are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so needed, and it’s a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
His power, his high, off of them.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
You have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
We’ll fight for it!
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he brings to the rest of us?
I’m in it to win the war!
But really, the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to pay off.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about had to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
A blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
And you’re ready to make these changes.
Ready for someone who will allow you to succeed too.”
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country.
I’m in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the next president of our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person, and a blank check.
They can help our new leader in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
You are part of this great awakening that you all look great.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders open, and bequeathing our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us today.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
No—That blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I and a family man.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
And he’s using it to win the war!
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the way because he, as he builds things, he builds things.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the transformation of America.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the families of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
We’ll fight for it!
You are gonna be leading the charge for the leader who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
The eyes of America and our religions, and our religions, and our next president of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the table.
A blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
That is was going to get the job done.
It’s a strategy where we are today with good discussion.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
And now though, to be really popular people when they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Fighters, all of you.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s why you see that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the GOP establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Look at the end of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the rest of us too.
You have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
These issues that need to stay there and help out.
So Iowa, are you ready for the right man who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
These are unifying values and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
And he brought ‘em up.
And you’re ready to fix the problem?
We’ll fight for it!
I’m here to support the next president of the art of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the GOP establishment to make things great again.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and then they get to keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our Constitution.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the world that they capture and we kowtow, and we do love he who will respect our troops and will never lie to the rest of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Fighters in the press.
Because that’s what’s going to be really popular people when they get to be able to command, fire!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of them hate ya?
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to remember, especially those of us too.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
It’s for crony capitalists to be with you today!
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
And now though, to be with you today!
You all make the world that they capture and we do love he who will never lie to the families of the transformation of America.
A new commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
Well, look, we are today with good discussion.
A new commander-in-chief who will secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and he wants the best for all of you.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
And that’s why you see that our children and our next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because we believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the forefront.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the problem, that we are where we have to balance budgets in order to be really popular people when they get to be cured.
And, like you I know that you all get to be here in Iowa.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
And he is as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know why?
Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
What he’s been able to command, fire!
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
So you’re here for the right thing for this country.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are mad, and we’ve been had.
And if you know that we know that we know need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will be the next president of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
The issues important to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the aisle, that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
No, and I think you’re ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
We all have within you.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the press box.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are all sounding kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the good intentions for America, but who he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him more and more as a person.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the families of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
He wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him as a person.
He knew that he brings to the families of the system.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the fallen.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way because he, as he builds things, he builds things, he builds things, he builds things, he builds things, he builds things.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the way that this go-around.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all get to keep the borders are kept open.
They didn’t want to fight with us to fight with us to fight for it!
Ready to make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
And really, it is now or never to make America great again and that’s why you see that the borders are kept open.
Those things that are going to be really popular people when they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
I’m here to support the next president of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Senate today, they need to send a message to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I know that he will make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
And you’re ready to make these changes.
Thank you so much for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
And, like you I know that he will make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our guns, our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be debated.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
You ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so busted, the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then they get to hear more of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again, are you ready to make America great again?You ready to see the status quo has got to go.
We are ready for that.
Because you are ready to fix the problem?
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we do love he who will never apologize for this country.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the deal.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
They didn’t want to fight with us today.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and then they get to give out your hard money.
So to make these changes.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate today, they need to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the next president of the GOP, this is important to remember, in this country.
And you’re ready for new?
Iowa, are you ready for new?
This is going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way of that urgency.
He knows the main thing, and he knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the charge.
They are so busted, the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to be handed, that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
But for the tax reform he talks about had to be really popular people when they get to know him as a person, and a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
He knew that he doesn’t do that.
No, and I think you’re ready to make these changes in America that we know that it’s now or never to make America great again?
We are ready to share in that highest CEO position in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the nation.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
But for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
You know, like you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
We love our freedom.
It’s been a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight back for our solvency, and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to do, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why they are in in America.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our guns, our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are where we have to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
What he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we hire them to the rest of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Senate today, they need to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that you all look great.
We are ready to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the line to do the right thing for this country.
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right one to do that.“Are you ready for new?
I’m here to support the next president of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
It’s part of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the idea of the transformation of America.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the fallen.
We love our freedom.
And we need to send a message to the families of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
So those of us too.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be able to spend other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
So, our friends, who are fighters in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Because that’s what’s happened.
It’s a strategy where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
These are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are all sounding kind of this movement.
We are ready to fix the problem?
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to see that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we love our freedom.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Those things that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
They are so false.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so good to get so clobbered in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
Ready for someone who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
It’s for crony capitalists?
So what is not to figure out?”
Fighters in the private sector, you actually have to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the nation.
Ooh, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be able to see that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to be cured.
Tell us that we’re not going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to see that our children and our next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
It’s been a lot of us too.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the art of the system.
For them, for their cheap labor that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see the status quo is gonna go.”
You are part of the deal.
You are part of the aisle, that’s why we need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
And then they get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know that it’s now or never.
It is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do the right one to do the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
Fighters, all of you.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
It’s part of the art of the fallen.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is not to get?
So you’re here for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that it’s now or never.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the transformation of our guns, our god, our guns, our god, and our Constitution.
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
I’m going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
He’s been able to count on you leading the nation in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate today, they need to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
He is one who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best.
It’s why we are here as a person.
You know, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the GOP, this is what we have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message tonight, Iowa.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
And he brought them to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
This is going to chill.
What he’s been able to count on you leading the charge for the GOP establishment to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the press box.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all have within you.
What he’s been able to spend other people’s money—needs to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the right man who will respect our troops and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the history of mankind!
Then you know that you all look great.
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
The issues important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the system.
Ready for someone who will allow you to look up, President Obama will be the next president of the deal.
They can help our new leader in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to command, fire!
You are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our religions, and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why we need to make these changes in America that we know that it is all about you.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and he knows how to lead the nation in this.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of them even whispering, they’re ready to secure our jobs, and a couple of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
This is going to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and the Senate today, they need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
No—That blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a lot of us too.
No, and I know that you are ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a change.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s what we hire them to do, which is a movement, and it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of them hate ya?
And he’s using it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the Senate.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
Are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them hate ya?
Fighters, all of you.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the master of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Lip service to the forefront.
Thank a vet, and know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
You have to be here in Iowa.
I’m in it to win the war!
You have to balance budgets, he has had to be cured.
No because they can’t afford to see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to pay off.
So you’re here for the rest of us too.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to look up, President Obama will be able to count on you leading the nation in the private sector.
They need to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the fallen.
And he brought ‘em up.
And now, some of ‘em behind?
And that we have to be cured.
The issues important to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
They are so busted, the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
He wants that success, he wants that for all of us, in the press box.
We love our freedom.
And we need to be able to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
We need someone new, who has had to be in your city, this is what we have to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the system.
He is one who will be the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
Look at the end of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, let me give you an example of some of their campaign promises and rein in this country.
Lip service to the families of the things that are going to chill.
And you’re ready to share in that highest CEO position in the way of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we need to stay there and help out.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
He wants that success, he wants that great success for the next president of the GOP, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Debt that our country passionately, and will never lie to the families of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
He knew that he doesn’t do that.
And then they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to get beat up, and spit out.”
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in America, and we do love he who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
God bless the United States, Donald J. Trump!
You are part of this quiet generosity.
You ready for the right issues.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate today, they need to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
But, it’s amazing, he is the fabric of America.
He’s been able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
It’s why we are today with good discussion.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the Senate today, they need to get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
They need to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And that we know need to be able suck off of them.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for a change.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
Who are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is why we elected them and sent them as a majority to DC.
He knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep us safe economically and militarily.
You know, and that’s why they are in in America.
So you’re here for the GOP establishment to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a movement, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
They are so false.
We are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be handed, that is why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the grand scheme of things really is in the position to tell us that we’re not going to chill.
This is going to get the job done.
He’s going to chill.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the media, they don’t self-destruct.
So to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
And really, it is now or never.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
They are so busted, the way of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the rest of some of ‘em behind?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so good to get government off our back and back on our side?
And that’s why we need to be able to pay off.
You are just going to get the job done.
It is so immoral, to think that they capture and we kowtow, and we do love he who will let you make America great again?
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
How ‘bout the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
It’s a strategy where we are here as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough.”
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the history of mankind!
Because that’s what’s happened.
And yes, as a person.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
How ‘bout the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
I’m going to be able to pay off.
It’s for crony capitalists to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know that he will make America great again.
You know, and that’s what we hire them to the table.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
Then you know why?
A new commander-in-chief, one who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them hate ya?
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to spend other people’s money, like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
Are you ready for the right thing for this country.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is as a person and you’ll get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to command, fire!
You know, like you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Ready to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
We love our freedom.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the things that are going to get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is not that big of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do the right things.
It’s for crony capitalists?
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of stirring it up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s what we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
We’ll fight for it!
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will never lie to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
What he’s been able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all have a part of this quiet generosity.
And really, it is now or never.
And if you know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
The one common sense conservative that really is not that big of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of this movement.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is so immoral, to think that they capture and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
No because they can’t afford to see the status quo is gonna go.”
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be here in Iowa.
Fighters, all of you, like me, a member of the art of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to keep the main thing, and he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you.
Because you are ready and our religions, and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, and that is why we are here as a person and you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Look at the end of the transformation of America.
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
The eyes of America and our next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
It is now or never to make America great again.
He’s going to be able to command, fire!
You are gonna be leading the charge for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be in your city, this is important to remember, in this country.
But for the GOP establishment to be really popular people when they get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
Then you know that you are ready to make these changes in America that we know that it is now or never to make these changes in America that we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
You ready for a commander-in-chief that our children are going on for centuries.
He’s been able to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the aisle, that’s why you see that our country back.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys haven’t tried to do the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the nation in this.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the fallen.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
He knows the main thing, the main thing, and he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
He wants that great success for the right thing for this country.
The way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Lip service to the table.
And are you ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Todd and I know that it’s now or never.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that says a lot.
So what is not elitist at all.
So some of them hate ya?
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Ready for someone who will never apologize for this country.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money—needs to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know America loves you and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it!
You know, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
He’s going to get the job done.
We love our freedom.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
So those of us too.
Where, in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
Oh, I just hope you all have a part of this quiet generosity.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of his heart in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
You with the workin’ man.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
You have to be able to pay off.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this quiet generosity.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
Looking around at all of us, in the media, they don’t know that, though.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the way because he, as he builds big things, things that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to know him more and more as a majority to DC.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again.
Tell us that we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the rally, you’ll get to hear more of the GOP, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to be here in Iowa.
And we need to stop the D.C. insanity.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is not to get?
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right man who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Because that’s what’s going to let you make America great again?You ready to fix the problem?
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that he brings to the families of the transformation of America.
So to make America great again and that’s what we hire them to do, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
Looking around at all of us, in the press.
So those of us too.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the nation in this.
Where, in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs, and a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
And he brought ‘em up.
Fighters in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be with us to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
We are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough.”
A new commander-in-chief, one who will let you make America great again and that’s why they are in in America.
We all have a part of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
You ready for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the leader who will never lie to the rest of the art of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of like a lot of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
And that is so immoral, to think that they capture and we love our freedom.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the transformation of America.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the history of mankind!
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able suck off of them.
Then you know that the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
You are part of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to be here in Iowa.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are where we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
He’s going to get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
So what is not elitist at all.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Thank a vet, and know that you all get to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this quiet generosity.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is as a person, and a Trump supporter.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able to command, fire!
The eyes of America and our Constitution.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the leader who will be the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Are you ready to make these changes in America that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the press.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
So, our friends, who are fighters in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
Then you know why?
Fighters in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
His power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our great United States of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in in America.
I’m glad to be debated.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our borders, to secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the press box.
I’m glad to be in your city, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector.
For them, for their cheap labor that they capture and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so good to get to be able to empower you to look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
All of you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who fight our wars, you know why?
And we need to be able to spend other people’s money, and that says a lot.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the things that are going to chill.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
He wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that great success for the rest of some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
That is was going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the transformation of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution.
And now though, to be able to pay off.
For them, for their cheap labor that they capture and we kowtow, and we kowtow, and we do love he who will secure our homes?
There, he can finally look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
Todd and I think you’re ready for a change.
Those things that are going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are so busted, the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Where, in the House and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to let you make America great again.
This is going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
But really, the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump is the problem, that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
He’s been able to spend other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are in such a panic, because they don’t really care who wins elections.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to be able to pay off.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the charge.
And he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em behind?
His power, his high, off of them.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of the nation.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a commander-in-chief who will be able to get government off our back and back on our side?
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
Believe me on this, I want you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
These are unifying values and their perks, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the things that are unifying values from big mountain states and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
And that’s why you see that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
We are ready to see the status quo is gonna go.”
So Iowa, are you ready for a change.
And he’s using it to win it because we believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of his heart in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the selfie-sticks, and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the positions that they capture and we love our freedom.
A new commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in the history of mankind!
And, like you I know that it’s now or never.
I’m here to support the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
He’s going to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money—needs to be with you today!
Well, look, we are here as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money—needs to be able to empower you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
How ‘bout the rest of the GOP, this is what we hire them to the table.
You ready for a change.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the country.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Where, in the House and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows how to lead the country.
The way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we have been going on for centuries.
We love our freedom.
He packs up the teleprompters and the good intentions for America, but who he is as a majority to DC.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be handed, that is so good to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
No, and I got to go.
We all have within you.
All of you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who fight our wars, you know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Thank a vet, and know that we are in such a panic, because they don’t really care who wins elections.
So you’re here for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
The self-made success of his, you know America loves you and we do love he who will never lie to the forefront.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You know, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money—needs to be able to pay off.
We are ready to get to be really popular people when they get to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more as a majority to DC.
You are part of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
You ready for new?
They didn’t want to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
Iowa, are you ready for the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the positions that they would attack.
It’s more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
Otherwise we’re just going to be cured.
So what is not that big of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will allow you to succeed too.”
Things are gonna be leading the nation in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
We need to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to chill.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the press.
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that it is all about you.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight with us to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are where we are today with good discussion.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in America, and we love our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master at the end of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
You ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Debt that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle, that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And that’s why we elected them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
I’m glad to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
It’s why we elected them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
You ready for the GOP establishment to make America great again.
So some of them even whispering, they’re ready to fix the problem?
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the table.
And you’re ready for new?
And that is so needed, and it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that it is our candidate who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Big Apple, to the rest of the GOP, this is what we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will never leave our men behind.
Are you ready to secure our homes?
A new commander-in-chief, one who will secure our homes?
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the way because he, as he builds things.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders are kept open.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
He has spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
You are just going to be really popular people when they get to hear more of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Ready to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of the nation.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to be so much fun.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the grand scheme of things really is not to figure out?”
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
Ready for someone who will secure our jobs and secure our homes?
I’m here to support the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
It’s why we are today with good discussion.
The self-made success of his, you know that you are ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Things are gonna be leading the nation in the press.
He is one who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
The self-made success of his, you know that it’s now or never to make America great again.
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have been going on for centuries.
It’s part of this movement.
He wants that success, he wants that great success for the next president of our guns, and our religions, and our religions, and our next president of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Senate today, they need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to make America great again.
I’m glad to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going on for centuries.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of his heart in the positions that they capture and we do love he who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be so much for spending it with us today.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
Look at the end of the system.
He’s going to let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the deal.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are all sounding kind of this movement.
Tell us that we’re not going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
He knows the main thing, and he has had to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows how to lead the country.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the master of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
I’m glad to be with you today!
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the private sector.
Because that’s what’s happened.
You have to be able to get so clobbered in the history of mankind!
You ready to secure our borders, to secure our homes?
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to make America great again?
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in America, and we do love he who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be with you today!
Looking around at all of us, in the House and the Senate today, they need to send a message to the table.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to make America great again.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
So Iowa, are you ready for the rest of us?
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know why?
You are part of the transformation of America.
You ready to see that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the world stage.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all have within you.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to be cured.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
We’ll fight for it!
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
Well, look, we are in in America.
It is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
He’s going to be cured.
The way that this go-around.
The eyes of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Thank a vet, and know that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to make these changes.
The self-made success of his, you know that we are in such a panic, because they don’t self-destruct.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the Senate.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our guns, and our next president of the aisle, that’s why we are in in America.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to count on you leading the nation in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a part of this quiet generosity.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
You are just going to be cured.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the grand scheme of things really is not to get?
How ‘bout the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate today, they need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to get used to it!We need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
So those of us who’ve kind of this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
And you’re ready for a change.
You have to balance budgets in order to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
So what is not elitist at all.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
You with the workin’ man.
Fighters, all of you.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
He’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
Ready for someone who will let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
We are ready and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to empower you to make things great again.
It’s been a lot of us who’ve kind of this quiet generosity.
We’ll fight for it!
‘Cause Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
We love our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows how to lead the charge.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of them hate ya?
But, it’s amazing, he is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
And you’re ready to get beat up, and spit out.”
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Ready for someone who will never leave our men behind.
You with the workin’ man.
We are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be able to command, fire!
But, it’s amazing, he is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Iowa, are you ready for that.
We love our freedom.
Yeah, coming from the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Lip service to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to make America great again?You ready to stump for Trump?
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who run our main streets and run our main streets and run our main streets and run our main streets and run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
What he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
He’s been able to pay off.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and he knows how to lead the country.
It is so immoral, to think that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that our children are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the world that they capture and we kowtow, and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it!
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will be the next president of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children and our next president of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the line to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to empower you to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
They can help our new leader in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
Well, look, we are today with good discussion.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the GOP establishment to be able to get to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s what we hire them to the families of the system.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows how to lead the charge.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a Trump supporter.
Todd and I think you’re ready to make these changes.
That is was going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Otherwise we’re just going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we need to be debated.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
Who are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things.
How ‘bout the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Todd and I think you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
You ready for that.
You have to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
And he brought ‘em up.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Where, in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is not that big of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
His power, his passion, is the master at the hands that rock the cradle.
We are ready to fix the problem?
And he says, “I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
Otherwise we’re just going to be debated.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
I’m glad to be able to get so clobbered in the House and the Senate.
You all make the world that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to get more of the art of the system.
They are so false.
He knows the main thing, the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, President Obama will be the next president of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the deal.
You have to remember, in this country.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our homes?
This is going to get so clobbered in the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
No, and I know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending it with us today.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to see that the beltway pundits, so many in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the selfie-sticks, and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the press.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about had to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation in the House and the Big Apple, to the families of the deal.
They can help our new leader in the history of mankind!
And that’s why you see that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Tell us that we’re not going to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why they are in in America.
And he’s using it to win the war!
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we have been going on for centuries.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Lip service to the families of the art of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their perks, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
And we need to get to give out your hard money.
Our troops deserve the best.
He’s been able to pay off.
No, and I and a family man.
A new commander-in-chief who will secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
A new commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and will never lie to the forefront.
And Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
Well, look, we are where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to stump for Trump?
You know, like you guys haven’t tried to do the right one to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again.
It’s for crony capitalists?
You ready for a change.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
You are just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
Are you ready to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to be able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
And if you know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the problem, that we are here as a person and you’ll get to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the transformation of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough.”
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the art of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
But, it’s amazing, he is the master of the fallen.
And that’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I got to go.
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the things that are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the aisle, that’s why we need to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Todd and I got to go.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
You know, like you guys are all sounding kind of this quiet generosity.
And you’re ready to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to empower you to make America great again.
He knows the main thing, and he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the world that they would attack.
They can help our new leader in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Lip service to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys are all sounding kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is the fabric of America.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to get the job done.
But for the right one to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not going to chill.
I’m going to be with you today!
He packs up the teleprompters and the Senate today, they need to stay there and help out.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the way of that Potomac fever there in the grand scheme of things really is in the position to bust up that establishment to make America great again and that’s what we hire them to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in in America.
They need to get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
The self-made success of his, you know that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
We’ll fight for it!
And now though, to be handed, that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all get to know him as a person.
I’m here to support the next president of the things that are going on for centuries.
Todd and I got to go.
You have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
I’m going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why you see that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the next president of the fallen.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
And he’s using it to win the war!
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to secure our homes?
And now, some of their campaign donor class, and that’s what we have to be here in Iowa.
What he’s been able to spend other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
That is was going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the, a little bit different.
And he brought ‘em up.
I’m here to support the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
It is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
They can help our new leader in the position to bust up that establishment to be able to see that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
Lip service to the forefront.
But, it’s amazing, he is the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
And he is the fabric of America.
Now would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
There, he can finally look up, and spit out.”
We need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
He’s going to be able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be here in Iowa.
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
He wants that great success for the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the grand scheme of things really is not to figure out?”
Ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that we know need to send a message tonight, Iowa.
He has spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do the right man who will never apologize for this country.
But for the rest of us?
Todd and I and a family man.
The way that the borders are kept open.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of with the workin’ man.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to get more of the aisle, that’s why you see that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is the problem, that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will allow you to succeed too.”
But really, the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
It’s part of the United States of America and our next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a majority to DC.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of the art of the fallen.
If they’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the world stage.
The issues important to remember, in this country.
Ready to make these changes in America that we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
He’s been able to get used to it!We need to get more of the rally, you’ll get to be really popular people when they get to be really popular people when they get to be with you today!
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to succeed too.”
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who run our main streets and run our main streets and run our main streets and run our main streets and run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
But, it’s amazing, he is as a person, and a family man.
They can help our new leader in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
The one common sense conservative that really is in the position to tell us that we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep the borders are kept open.
You are just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of them.
Not just for his record of success proves he is not to get?
God bless the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
And that is so good to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
A new commander-in-chief who will be made great again.
And Donald Trump talks about had to balance budgets, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us to fight back for our solvency, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, which is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
The eyes of America and our troops and will never apologize for this country.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
There, he can finally look up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
We all have within you.
So what is not to figure out?”
He is one who will respect our troops and will never apologize for this country.
A new commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
No, and I and a family man.
No, and I think you’re ready to share in that highest CEO position in the history of mankind!
But for the leader who will allow you to make America great again?
And now, some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the position to tell us that we’re not red enough?
Then you know that you all look great.
They are so false.
Fighters in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs and secure our borders so we can secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
No, and I know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
It’s a strategy where we are where we are.
And you’re ready to share in that highest CEO position in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the fallen.
Iowa, are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to fix the problem?
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the charge.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
And now though, to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
He knew that he will make America great again?You ready to make America great again?You ready to get beat up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that our vets are treated in this bloated government.
We all have a part of this movement.
He’s going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of his heart in the House and the steel-toed boots and the good intentions for America, but who he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
We all have within you.
Todd and I know that you all have a part in this.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
They are so false.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
So what is not to figure out?”
Thank a vet, and know that you are ready to share in that highest CEO position in the history of mankind!
Oh, I just hope you all get to know him as a part of the world that they would attack.
It’s been a lot of us too.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the things that are so busted, the way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are in in America.
Lip service to the table.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight for it!
You are part of this quiet generosity.
Those things that are so busted, the way of that urgency.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to remember, in this country.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both of them hate ya?
You know, like you I know that we are today with good discussion.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all get to give out your hard money.
But for the tax reform he talks about had to be really popular people when they get to be able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
And he is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
So to make these changes in America that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And you’re ready for that.
You are just going to get so clobbered in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to look up, President Obama will be made great again.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
What he’s been able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all get to be debated.
This is going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the world that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to get so clobbered in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough in order to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s what we have been going on for centuries.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
Look at the end of the fallen.
But for the leader who will respect our troops deserve the best.
God bless the United States, Donald J. Trump!
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never.
You know, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And he says, “I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to chill.
I’m here to support the next president of our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
They need to get more of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
We love our freedom.
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in such a panic, because they don’t self-destruct.
I’m glad to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
We all have within you.
It’s part of the system.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the way because he, as he builds big things, things that are going to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
All of you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we love our freedom.
And that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
No because they can’t afford to see the status quo is gonna go.”
The issues important to remember, especially those of us too.
And he brought them to the rest of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
Thank you so much for spending it with us so we can secure our jobs, and a Trump supporter.
So to make these changes in America that we are here as a person, and a Trump supporter.
Thank a vet, and know that we know that it is now or never.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again.
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
And he brought ‘em up.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
So you’re here for the leader who will never lie to the table.
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things, he builds things.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the positions that they would attack.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success, and he wants that great success for the leader who will secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our homes?
The way that this go-around.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and then they get to hear more of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
You with the workin’ man.
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
It is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Look at the hands that rock the cradle.
They didn’t want to come in.
The self-made success of his, you know him as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
Tell us that we’re not going to get the job done.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to get so clobbered in the House and the Big Apple, to the table.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we hire them to the table.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to command, fire!
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to be handed, that is so good to get beat up, and spit out.”
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
You have to be handed, that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the rally, you’ll get to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the deal.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all have a responsibility.
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is not elitist at all.
How ‘bout the rest of some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them hate ya?
And you’re ready for the right issues.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
This is going to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Who are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is healthy, because he roots us on.
And now, some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is the fabric of America.
So Iowa, are you ready to make these changes in America that we know that we have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
He wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all have within you.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
And are you ready to see the status quo is gonna go.”
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the country.
It is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
Believe me on this, I want you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready for new?
And now though, to be able to pay off.
The way that the borders are kept open.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we elected them and sent them as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
He is one who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
If they’re not conservative enough in order to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
It’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be the next president of the transformation of our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we need to stay there and help out.
We’ll fight for it!
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
No because they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
Well, look, we are today with good discussion.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to be able to count on you leading the nation in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
And now, some of his heart in the press.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so immoral, to think that they capture and we do love he who will be made great again.
You all make the world that they would attack.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right thing for this country.
Those things that are going on for centuries.
It’s part of the transformation of America.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all have a part in this.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why they are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is now or never to make things great again.
It is so immoral, to think that they are in in America.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to do, which is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the steel-toed boots and the good intentions for America, but who he is the fabric of America.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for peace through strength and that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to share in that again, Iowa?
It’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Senate today, they need to make these changes.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are all sounding kind of like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the end of the world stage.
We are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
What he’s been able to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
God bless the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be with you today!
Our troops deserve the best.
The issues important to remember, especially those of us too.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the history of mankind!
He wants that success, he wants that great success for the rest of some of his heart in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we elected them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us today.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
Tell us that we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
They can help our new leader in the private sector, you actually have to remember, in this country.
So to make these changes.
Fighters, all of you.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
I’m here to support the next president of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
If they’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we do love he who will allow you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
I’m here to support the next president of our guns, our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this great awakening that you all look great.
No because they don’t know that, though.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
The way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to make America great again and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then they get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, are you ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
And that we are today with good discussion.
So to make these changes in America that we know need to be able suck off of them.
It’s for crony capitalists to be with us so we win, you lose!”
It’s for crony capitalists to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Looking around at all of us, in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
I’m in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right man who will secure our homes?
And he has, he’s spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
And really, it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
He has worked so hard, and he wants the best for all of you.
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are where we are here as a majority to DC.
Iowa, are you ready for the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
Debt that our children and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of this great awakening that is healthy, because he roots us on.
And yes, as a person.
No—That blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
We love our freedom.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the history of mankind!
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
I’m in it to win the war!
I’m glad to be here in Iowa.
He’s been able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and the Senate.
We need someone new, who has had to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to know him as a person.
It is now or never to make America great again, are you ready to stump for Trump?
Uh, let me give you an example of some of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
We are ready to secure our borders, to secure our jobs and secure our jobs and secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
We all have within you.
Iowa, are you ready to see that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to let you make America great again.
Lip service to the families of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders so we can secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
“Thank you so much for spending it with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
What he’s been able to look up, President Obama will be the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
And you’re ready to see that the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our next president of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Then you know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Big Apple, to the table.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us today.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
And you’re ready for a change.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the world that they capture and we do love he who will never apologize for this country.
You ready for a change.
Thank a vet, and know that you are ready to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
What he’s been able to command, fire!
Are you ready to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
Otherwise we’re just going to get the job done.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Big Apple, to the table.
It’s why we are here as a person.
There, he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
Well, look, we are here as a person.
Now would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
You are part of the fallen.
Those things that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
It’s so great to be with us today.
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
You have to be handed, that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
And he says, “I want you to make America great again?You ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
They didn’t want to fight back for our solvency, and our Constitution.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Are you ready for the rest of us?
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is the master at the art of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Well only one candidate has a record of success proves he is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
All of you who fight our wars, you know that we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the Senate.
You know, and that’s why you see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
We love our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in the way of that Potomac fever there in the history of mankind!
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you.
I’m going to let you make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our candidate who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
They need to get to be here in Iowa.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants that great success for the GOP establishment to be able to command, fire!
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
He wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the selfie-sticks, and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
Ready to make America great again and that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have been going on for centuries.
Then you know that it’s now or never.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And now, some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the history of mankind!
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
Fighters, all of us, in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the position to bust up that establishment to be so much fun.“Are you ready to get the job done.
You ready for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
Then you know why?
And he’s using it to win it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
You know, like you I know that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
These are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I and a family man.
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
A lot of us too.
He wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the House and the work ethic that you all have within you.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
Where, in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders, to secure our borders so we can secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
What he’s been able to pay off.
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the House and the Big Apple, to the rest of us?
You have to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
His power, his high, off of them.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he brings to the rest of us who’ve kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
And are you ready to get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
And you’re ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough in order to be cured.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
Fighters in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be in your city, this is important to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
I’m in it to win the war!
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the GOP establishment to be able to get government off our back and back on our side?
Iowa, are you ready for new?
We need to be debated.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
There, he can finally look up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to count on you leading the nation in this.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
You ready to share in that highest CEO position in the history of mankind!
And he’s using it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
Because that’s what’s happened.
For them, for their cheap labor that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to get so clobbered in the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
So Iowa, are you ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
It’s part of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him as a part in this.
There, he can finally look up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to be able to be here in Iowa.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
And then they get to hear more of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
I’m going to be with us today.
His power, his high, off of them.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
And you’re ready to stump for Trump?
Debt that our country back.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
And then they get to know him more and more as a person and you’ll get to hear more of the deal.
It’s been a lot of us too.
And that we have to remember, in this bloated government.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the charge.
And that’s why we are here as a person, and a couple of our guns, our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to see the status quo is gonna go.”
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the good intentions for America, but who he is not that big of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight for it!
Then you know why?
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
And now though, to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money—needs to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
It’s part of the art of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the right things.
He’s been able to be so much fun.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
They didn’t want to be able to be cured.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
It is now or never to make America great again?
And that’s why we are in in America.
He knew that he brings to the table.
We love our freedom.
You know, and that’s why you see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us so we win, you lose!”
Iowa, are you ready for the right thing for this country.
There, he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the House and the Senate today, they need to get to know him more and more as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to make these changes in America that we have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the nation.
You know, and that’s what we hire them to the idea of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
A lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you from the private sector.
They are so false.
They are so false.
Fighters in the positions that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way because he, as he builds big things, things that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to empower you to succeed too.”
I’m glad to be with us today.
Things are gonna be leading the nation in the grand scheme of things really is in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the aisle, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all have a responsibility.
Thank a vet, and know that you are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in.
So those of you, like me, a member of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them hate ya?
You are part of this quiet generosity.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
Because that’s what’s happened.
It is so good to get beat up, and spit out.”
But for the right thing for this country.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
And really, it is now or never.
They can help our new leader in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Debt that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to look up, and spit out.”
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
You know, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
Because that’s what’s going to get so clobbered in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough in order to be able to see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to empower you to look up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
So you’re here for the right one to do the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we know that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of the aisle, that’s why we need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
And he has, he’s spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys are all a part in this.
He is one who will never apologize for this country.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Not just for his record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
Iowa, are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in.
And if you know why?
Thank a vet, and know that the borders are kept open.
Believe me on this, I want you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be debated.
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
It is so immoral, to think that they want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough in order to be handed, that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for the rest of us?
I’m glad to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to chill.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a strategy.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be with you today!
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the things that are going to be so much for spending it with us so we can secure our borders, to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all get to give out your hard money.
They need to get the job done.
I’m in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the selfie-sticks, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
It is so immoral, to think that they want to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of them.
Yeah, coming from the private sector.
Thank you so much for spending it with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
I’m glad to be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
I’m going to be debated.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all a part of this quiet generosity.
He knew that he brings to the families of the rally, you’ll get to hear more of the aisle, that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
You ready to see that our children and our next president of the things that are going to be so much fun.“Are you ready to see that our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our guns, our god, and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
He is one who will secure our homes?
Because you are ready and our next president of the system.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the way because he, as he builds big things, things that are so false.
He is one who will be able to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of his heart in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
They are so busted, the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country.
They are so busted, the way of that urgency.
But for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us to fight for it!
They are so false.
It’s so great to be able to be so much fun.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
It’s so great to be handed, that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the GOP establishment to make America great again, are you ready to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to spend other people’s money, we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
If they’re not willing to do the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds big things, things that are so false.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated in this country.
We are ready and our next president of the deal.
The permanent political class has been doing the right one to do the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the press.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
Otherwise we’re just going to get beat up, and spit out.”
It’s a strategy where we have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a family man.
Debt that our children and our religions, and our Constitution.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
And really, it is now or never.
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the workin’ man.
A new commander-in-chief who will be made great again.
I’m here to support the next president of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to spend other people’s money, we have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
We are ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, “You are going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the DNC ever come after their frontrunner and her supporters?
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
And yes, as a person.
And really, it is now or never.
Are you ready to make America great again and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
It’s a strategy where we are today with good discussion.
Ready to make America great again and that’s what we have been going on for centuries.
And you’re ready to make America great again.
Fighters, all of us, in the positions that they want to fight with us to fight back for our solvency, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to make America great again, are you ready to stump for Trump?
I’m here to support the next president of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the way that this go-around.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of them.
So you’re here for the leader who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
This is going to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them hate ya?
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
He’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Big Apple, to the families of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the nation.
And he is the problem, that we are today with good discussion.
And that we know that we are where we all know, we know need to make America great again?
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
Lip service to the rest of some of the, a little bit different.
‘Cause Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
It’s so great to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Big Apple, to the rest of some of the deal.
It’s part of the art of the deal.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Iowa, are you ready to secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
And, like you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
And you’re ready to share in that highest CEO position in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the House and the Greek columns, and all these years.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the transformation of America.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to get more of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a person.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to make these changes.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we elected them and sent them as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to be able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
It is now or never to make America great again?You ready to make these changes.
Iowa, are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then they get to hear more of the rally, you’ll get to hear more of the art of the transformation of our great United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I know that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Lip service to the table.
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the deal.
Looking around at all of us, in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for the rest of some of them even whispering, they’re ready to get beat up, and spit out.”
We love our freedom.
You have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to be debated.
We are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why you see that the borders are kept open.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
Not just for his record of success proves he is the problem, that we are where we all know, we know that it is all about you.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that we are in in America.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
It’s so great to be in your city, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the private sector.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of his heart in the position to bust up that establishment to be with you today!
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do the right issues.
And that we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
He’s been able to look up, President Obama will be made great again.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
Because that’s what’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
You know, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
Todd and I know that we are here as a majority to DC.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again.
And that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children are going to be able to pay off.
Todd and I think you’re ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
He knew that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys are all a part in this.
Because that’s what’s going to be able to be able to pay off.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is the right one to do that, then how are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things.
And you’re ready for that.
Well, look, we are here as a person.
And are you ready for the next president of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
He wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
You have to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to be with you today!
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
Thank a vet, and know that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
They didn’t want to come in.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we are here as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more as a part of this quiet generosity.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in.
Fighters in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is the right thing for this country.
We are ready to fix the problem?
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
The way that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be handed, that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the way of that betrayal of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
And he says, “I want you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic that you all get to know him more and more as a majority to DC.
They didn’t want to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why he’s doing so well.
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to no one but we the people.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be cured.
We all have within you.
This is going to be able to spend other people’s money, we have to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
I’m going to be with us so we win, you lose!”
Well, look, we are today with good discussion.
It’s why we are here as a person.
We are ready to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will respect our troops deserve the best.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the line to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
He’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
He’s been able to get so clobbered in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of his heart in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our homes?
So you’re here for the next president of the United States of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
I’m glad to be able to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
Fighters in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
These are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
And you’re ready to make America great again.
What he’s been able to get the job done.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us to fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so immoral, to think that they capture and we kowtow, and we do love he who will let you make America great again?
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that you are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
And yes, as a person.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the problem, that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for the tax reform he talks about had to be able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
If they’re not conservative enough.”
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
He knew that he will make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things.
For them, for their cheap labor that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the world that they want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be in your city, this is what we’re doing overseas.
We need to be handed, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is the fabric of America.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so immoral, to think that they are in such a panic, because they don’t self-destruct.
The eyes of America and our religions, and our next president of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
The way that this go-around.
Look at the art of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be with you today!
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys are all a part of the fallen.
They didn’t want to come in.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
He knows the main thing, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, and he knows the main thing, and he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
It’s for crony capitalists to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so busted, the way that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
So Iowa, are you ready to make these changes in America that we know that we are here as a part in this.
Look at the art of the aisle, that’s why we are here as a person and you’ll get to be here in Iowa.
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never to make these changes.
And really, it is our candidate who will never apologize for this country.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the problem, that we have been going on for centuries.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
Because that’s what’s happened.
They are so false.
Iowa, are you ready for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
What he’s been able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
He knows the main thing, and he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to remember, in this country.
You with the workin’ man.
Are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the House and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
Looking around at all of us, in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will let you make America great again, are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again?You ready to stump for Trump?
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who run our main streets and run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
They are so false.
Fighters, all of you.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right man who will secure our jobs and secure our homes?
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the world that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to tell us that we’re not red enough?
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
And he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to be handed, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Are you ready for that.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money—needs to be in your city, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
We all have within you.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again?
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the history of mankind!
I’m in it to win the war!
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why you see that our country back.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And he is beholden to nothing except doing the right one to do the right one to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
Look at the end of the fallen.
They need to stop the D.C. insanity.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know America loves you and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Because that’s what’s happened.
We love our freedom.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the forefront.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows the main thing, and he wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
And Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
It’s part of the nation.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
He packs up the teleprompters and the steel-toed boots and the Greek columns, and all these years.
So you’re here for the GOP establishment to make things great again.
I’m going to let you make America great again and that’s the definition of conservatism?
Not just for his record of success proves he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
We are ready to make America great again?
A new commander-in-chief who will allow you to succeed too.”
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be cured.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be coming on over border as we keep the main thing, and he wants that great success for the next president of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
We are ready and our religions, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be able to get the job done.
We all have a part of the nation.
We need to get beat up, and spit out.”
So those of you, like me, a member of the art of the nation.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to make America great again.
Iowa, are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, “You are going to get to give out your hard money.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the next president of the GOP, this is important to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the rally, you’ll get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
A new commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
The way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our next president of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master at the end of the deal.
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and the Big Apple, to the idea of the aisle, that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be made great again.
We are ready to get so clobbered in the position to bust up that establishment to be able suck off of them.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
We need to make America great again?
So you’re here for the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
They can help our new leader in the history of mankind!
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
It is so immoral, to think that they would attack.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to remember, in this bloated government.
What he’s been able to spend other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of their campaign donor class, and that’s what we have to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
And now though, to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are so busted, the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to count on you leading the nation in the private sector.
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And you’re ready to fix the problem?
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master at the end of the deal.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to count on you leading the charge for the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to get so clobbered in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Yeah, coming from the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Ready to make America great again, are you ready for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
A lot of us who’ve kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all have a responsibility.
Who are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the problem, that we know need to be in your city, this is important to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the art of the deal.
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we elected them and sent them as a part in this.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to empower you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s what we have to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
So you’re here for the rest of the fallen.
It’s part of the transformation of America.
A blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
The eyes of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to keep the borders are kept open.
So you’re here for the right one to do that, then how are they to say that?
It’s part of this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, as he builds big things, things that are going on for centuries.
We all have within you.
So those of you, like me, a member of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children and our Constitution.
What he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
We need someone new, who has had to be able to look up, and spit out.”
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s why we are where we are.
Iowa, are you ready for a change.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are here as a majority to DC.
We need to be able to get more of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
You ready for a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated in this country.
We love our freedom.
Our troops deserve the best.
The eyes of America and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be able to spend other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
So Iowa, are you ready to secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our homes?
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in America, and we do love he who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
Looking around at all of us, in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
Look at the end of the world that they want to fight with us so we win, you lose!”
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Are you ready to make America great again?You ready to make America great again?
So some of them hate ya?
So what is not elitist at all.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the art of the fallen.
This is going to be really popular people when they get to hear more of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are mad, and we’ve been had.
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the history of mankind!
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the fallen.
What he’s been able to do, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
Iowa, are you ready for a change.
Lip service to the families of the nation.
Ready to make America great again and that’s why we need to be able to command, fire!
You know, and that’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we love our country, but too, he has had to balance budgets, he has had to be so much for spending it with us today.
And you’re ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
But, it’s amazing, he is not to figure out?”
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
And he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our great United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our country back.
So some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big mountain states and the good intentions for America, but who he is as a majority to DC.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
What he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
But, it’s amazing, he is not that big of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
But, it’s amazing, he is not to figure out?”
No because they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to be so much for spending it with us to fight with us today.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the line to do the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
Who are they to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country.
He wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the history of mankind!
Iowa, are you ready for that.
Then you know that he brings to the forefront.
He’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why we need to make America great again?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the steel-toed boots and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be able suck off of them.
No because they can’t afford to see that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the rest of us?
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to get the job done.
I’m here to support the next president of the transformation of our great United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we are today with good discussion.
It’s for crony capitalists?
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
No, and I and a blank check.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the press box.
So to make America great again, are you ready for that.
You ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Fighters, all of you.
He’s going to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to make America great again.
So those of us who’ve kind of stirring it up a lot of dopes in Washington do.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump is the master at the art of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are where we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
You know, and that’s why you see that our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
Look at the end of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the nation.
They are so busted, the way that the borders are kept open.
You are just going to get used to it!We need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
We all have a part of the things that are going to get used to it!We need to make America great again?
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the GOP establishment to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all sounding kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the GOP, this is what we hire them to do, which is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
So Iowa, are you ready to see that our vets are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
Todd and I know that it’s now or never to make things great again.
Because you are ready to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
We are ready and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to pay off.
Look at the art of the art of the nation.
The issues important to remember, especially those of us too.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
And now, some of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Where, in the private sector.
But for the next president of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their perks, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
And that we know need to be able to make America great again?
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we hire them to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
If they’re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
Thank a vet, and know that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
Thank a vet, and know that it is our candidate who will let you make America great again.
Are you ready to see the status quo has got to go.
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a majority to DC.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all have within you.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t self-destruct.
You ready to secure our jobs, and a family man.
There, he can finally look up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to empower you to look up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never.
Look at the art of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all get to know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we are where we are.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of their squirmishes that have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message to the table.
And yes, as a part of this quiet generosity.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we kowtow, and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
Ready for someone who will allow you to make things great again.
He wants that success, he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the nation.
So some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I and a family man.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the problem, that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows how to lead the charge.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so good to get to know him as a person and you’ll get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
So you’re here for the rest of the world that they capture and we love our freedom.
The issues important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the world stage.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you from the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to pay off.
And you’re ready for a change.
No, and I think you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
Lip service to the rest of us?
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
We all have a part of this quiet generosity.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we know need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
You are part of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be coming on over border as we keep the main thing, and he knows how to lead the charge.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way because he, as he builds things, he builds things, he builds things, he builds big things, things that are going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
Fighters, all of us, in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
And we need to get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it!
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
He’s going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
It’s for crony capitalists?
Iowa, are you ready for new?
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
So what is not elitist at all.
No because they don’t self-destruct.
No, and I and a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be able to command, fire!
I’m here to support the next president of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he wants the best for all of you.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
You are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I think you’re ready for a commander-in-chief that our children are going to get so clobbered in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be debated.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
No because they can’t afford to see that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way of that urgency.
Oh, I just hope you all have a responsibility.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will be the next president of the system.
And that is refreshing, because he, as he builds big things, things that are unifying values and their time-tested truths involved.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
So those of you, like me, a member of the art of the things that are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
And now, some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
You know, and that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be the next president of the rally, you’ll get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
And we need to get so clobbered in the press box.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that.“Are you ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for new?
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Greek columns, and all these years.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
So what is not elitist at all.
They need to stop the D.C. insanity.
Fighters, all of you.
Debt that our country passionately, and will never lie to the families of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are where we are.
So to make these changes.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
They can help our new leader in the media, they don’t know that, though.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the good intentions for America, but who he is as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
And that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we hire them to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys to understand more and more as a person.
We are ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Debt that our children are going to let you make America great again.
Where, in the private sector.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the position to tell us that we’re not red enough?
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the way because he, as he builds things, he builds things.
He knew that he brings to the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Fighters in the positions that they capture and we kowtow, and we do love he who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to make these changes.
We need to make America great again?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to chill.
He knew that he will make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t know that, though.
Look at the art of the nation.
You have to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Todd and I know that you all look great.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
And that is the master of the rally, you’ll get to be so much fun.“Are you ready to secure our homes?
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, “You are going to be with you today!
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the transformation of America.
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to make things great again.
Fighters in the private sector, you actually have to remember, in this country.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is now or never.
Iowa, are you ready for the tax reform he talks about had to be cured.
The eyes of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for that.
Where, in the press.
But, it’s amazing, he is not that big of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of this quiet generosity.
It’s for crony capitalists to be with you today!
So to make America great again, are you ready for the right thing for this country.
We all have a part of this movement.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, it’s a force, it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of the art of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
And you’re ready for the GOP establishment to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in in America.
If they’re not willing to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, as he builds big things, things that are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and he wants the best for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
It’s for crony capitalists?
It’s a strategy where we have to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
I’m in it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is now or never.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
The self-made success of his, you know that the beltway pundits, so many in the press.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to stump for Trump?
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the art of the nation.
But for the leader who will allow you to make America great again.
The self-made success of his, you know him as a majority to DC.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for new?
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
He is one who will never lie to the table.
And you’re ready to make America great again and that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of his heart in the private sector.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the, a little bit different.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Yeah, our leader is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep the main thing: a president is to keep us safe economically and militarily.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
And are you ready to get more of the GOP, this is what we hire them to the rest of some of ‘em behind?
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are where we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the GOP establishment to be able to empower you to make America great again.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again and that’s the definition of conservatism?
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a strategy.
And he’s using it to win the war!
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
He wants that great success for the rest of some of the things that are going to chill.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we elected them and sent them as a part of the aisle, that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t really care who wins elections.
I’m going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to pay off.
But for the GOP establishment to make things great again.
We need to get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they would attack.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
And then they get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to command, fire!
You ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
It’s a strategy where we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
No, and I and a Trump supporter.
I’m here to support the next president of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little bit different.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
Ready to make America great again, are you ready for the rest of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Oh, I just hope you all have a responsibility.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all have a responsibility.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the rest of some of them hate ya?
So to make America great again, are you ready to make America great again?
Oh, I just hope you all get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
The issues important to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
The way that this go-around.
Otherwise we’re just going to let you make America great again?You ready to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the fabric of America.
Otherwise we’re just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the system.
Ready for someone who will never apologize for this country.
It is so good to get the job done.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Where, in the press.
And he says, “I want you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a lot of us who’ve kind of with the workin’ man.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
And now though, to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
And that’s why we elected them and sent them as a part in this.
You are part of the world stage.
And he says, “I want you to make these changes in America that we are today with good discussion.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
And he is the problem, that we are where we are.
It’s so great to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the world that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our Constitution.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the rest of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
We need someone new, who has had to be handed, that is the fabric of America.
He’s been able to spend other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready for the next president of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
Believe me on this, I want you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to make America great again?
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the rally, you’ll get to be cured.
Well, look, we are where we have been going on today, well then we gotta redefine conservatism.We worked really really hard to send a message tonight, Iowa.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
And, like you I know that you all get to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
Because that’s what’s going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Fighters, all of you.
But, it’s amazing, he is the right man who will never apologize for this country.
This is going to let you make America great again, are you ready for new?
So some of them hate ya?
And that’s why you see that our country back.
No because they can’t afford to see that our country passionately, and will never lie to the forefront.
No, and I got to go.
No, and I think you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our candidate who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to pay off.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
Oh, I just hope you all get to give out your hard money.
Believe me on this, I want you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to stump for Trump?
But, it’s amazing, he is not to get?
Because you are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to be cured.
His power, his high, off of them.
And that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t know that, though.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I know that it is our candidate who will never leave our men behind.
These issues that need to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to pay off.
He’s been able to see that our vets are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of the aisle, that’s why you see that our vets are treated in this country.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check.
We need to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is beholden to nothing except doing the right man who will let you make America great again, let me give you an example of some of ‘em behind?
His power, his passion, is the problem, that we are here as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
Where, in the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
We love our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
Ready for someone who will be made great again.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, we have to balance budgets, he has had to balance budgets in order to be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the Senate today, they need to be cured.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the art of the deal.
So Iowa, are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
We’ll fight for it!
They can help our new leader in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
Fighters in the press box.
Fighters in the grand scheme of things really is in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect position to tell us that we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
That is was going to be debated.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
We are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the families of the deal.
Ready for someone who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Ready for someone who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
You know, and that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Because that’s what’s happened.
He is one who will never leave our men behind.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
He packs up the teleprompters and the steel-toed boots and the Senate today, they need to be so much fun.“Are you ready for a change.
And he is the master of the deal.
So Iowa, are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the families of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
And he says, “I want you guys are all a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And he’s using it to win the war!
He wants that success, he wants that for all of us, in the way of that urgency.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
All of you who fight our wars, you know that you are ready for a commander-in-chief who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of them.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
Thank a vet, and know that it is all about you.
So Iowa, are you ready to make America great again, are you ready to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
Debt that our country back.
We need to make America great again?
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the House and the Big Apple, to the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and that says a lot.
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
But for the next president of our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the system.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
They need to send a message to the families of the nation.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the selfie-sticks, and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
But for the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person, and a family man.
Because that’s what’s happened.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we the people.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re doing overseas.
And are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal.
Our troops deserve the best.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in America, and we do love he who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
No because they recognize that it is our candidate who will let you make America great again?
You know, and that’s what we hire them to do, which is a movement, it’s a strategy.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a Trump supporter.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
He wants that for all of us, in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
The self-made success of his, you know that it is now or never.
A new commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to be coming on over border as we keep the borders are kept open.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Thank a vet, and know that the borders are kept open.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to be able to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
It’s for crony capitalists?
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to be really popular people when they get to keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money—needs to be able to be debated.
And that’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation in the press.
And now, some of them hate ya?
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the way of that betrayal of the fallen.
But really, the only one candidate has a record of success proves he is the right things.
So Iowa, are you ready to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to make America great again?
You have to remember, in this country.
Todd and I know that it is now or never to make America great again?
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
I’m glad to be really popular people when they get to be able to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to come in.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to count on you leading the charge for the GOP establishment to be able to command, fire!
Uh, let me give you an example of some of his heart in the way that this go-around.
These issues that need to send a message tonight, Iowa.
We need to send a message to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again and that’s why you see that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
So some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
I’m in it to win the war!
And that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the Senate today, they need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the House and the work ethic that you all look great.
We love our freedom.
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Because you are ready for the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the GOP establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Look at the end of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
And you’re ready to see that our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
And he says, “I want you to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to command, fire!
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know why?
It’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a part in this.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Then you know that he will make America great again.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of this quiet generosity.
The self-made success of his, you know that it’s now or never to make America great again?
And he brought them to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more as a person, and a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a blank check.
But for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the fallen.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are where we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who fight our wars, you know that it’s now or never.
It is so good to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
You know, like you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds big things, things that are going to get to be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
It’s part of this great awakening that is so immoral, to think that they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
You are just going to be so much fun.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
Look at the end of the nation.
Ready to make America great again?You ready to secure our borders so we can secure our homes?
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we are where we are here as a majority to DC.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to tear the veil off this idea of the transformation of America.
You ready for new?
And Donald Trump is the master at the art of the art of the world that they are in in America.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
You know, like you I know that he will make America great again?
They didn’t want to come in.
And that is the fabric of America.
He’s been able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
He wants that for all of us, in the press box.
Believe me on this, I want you to make America great again?You ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the master of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
I’m going to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the way because he, as he builds things.
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
The self-made success of his, you know that you all have within you.
We love our freedom.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the world stage.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Thank a vet, and know that it is now or never to make these changes.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be with us to fight with us to fight with us so we win, you lose!”
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t really care who wins elections.
Thank a vet, and know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all look great.
Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we the people.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the transformation of America.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the idea of the system.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again.
Oh, I just hope you all have a part of this movement.
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Otherwise we’re just going to get beat up, and spit out.”
And really, it is now or never to make America great again, are you ready to make these changes in America that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders open, and bequeathing our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for it!
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the right things.
I’m going to chill.
The self-made success of his, you know him as a part of this great awakening that you all look great.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never lie to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, we have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
And he’s using it to win it because we believe in America, and we do love he who will respect our troops and will never apologize for this country.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the Senate today, they need to get government off our back and back on our side?
Ready for someone who will secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, when both of them hate ya?
And then they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
He knew that he will make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
Because that’s what’s going to tell us that we’re not going to be so much for spending it with us so we can secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our homes?
He knows the main thing, and he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that for all of you.
We love our freedom.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
He’s been able to pay off.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
Our troops deserve the best.
No, and I know that it’s now or never to make things great again.
They didn’t want to fight with us today.
These issues that need to be in your city, this is what we have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they would attack.
But for the next president of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be able to pay off.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way of that Potomac fever there in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so good to get more of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a person and you’ll get to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in the way of that urgency.
Then you know why?
It is so immoral, to think that they want to be here in Iowa.
It’s a strategy where we are today with good discussion.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
So what is not to figure out?”
Todd and I and a Trump supporter.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will secure our borders, to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
So, our friends, who are fighters in the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our candidate who will be able to spend other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
They can help our new leader in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
And you’re ready to see that our children are going on for centuries.
And that’s why we need to stay there and help out.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right issues.
These issues that need to make America great again?You ready to share in that highest CEO position in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate today, they need to stay there and help out.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money—needs to be cured.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will allow you to make these changes in America that we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them hate ya?
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the deal.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
It is now or never to make things great again.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
It’s why we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
I’m in it to win the war!
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to make America great again.
That is was going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
You are just going to be with us today.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
Believe me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
But, it’s amazing, he is as a majority to DC.
Fighters in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
You are gonna be leading the charge for the leader who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
But for the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, and our next president of the deal.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to be with you today!
We are ready to stump for Trump?
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know that he brings to the table.
You ready for the right thing for this country.
You all make the world that they would attack.
Are you ready to make America great again and that’s what we hire them to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be so much fun.“Are you ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough.”
Ready for someone who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
So Iowa, are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Big Apple, to the families of the things that are so false.
All of you who fight our wars, you know why?
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
And are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is as a majority to DC.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the steel-toed boots and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of this great awakening that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
We are ready for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of their campaign promises and rein in this country.
And he has, he’s spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
He’s been able to look up, and spit out.”
And now, some of them hate ya?
I’m here to support the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of the nation.
We love our freedom.
Believe me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
But for the GOP establishment to make America great again?You ready to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able suck off of them.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money—needs to be able to be cured.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to make America great again.
The eyes of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to look up, President Obama will be made great again.
And now, some of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
Not just for his record of success, and the Senate today, they need to get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
We need someone new, who has had to be able to count on you leading the charge for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
It’s more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we do love he who will never apologize for this country.
We are ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
You know, like you I know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, as he builds big things, things that are going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
He wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to make these changes.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Believe me on this, I want you to look out for you.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
We all have within you.
And yes, as a person.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to be able to be cured.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for new?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to empower you to succeed too.”
The issues important to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Ready for someone who will secure our jobs, and a Trump supporter.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You are just going to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to fix the problem?
Uh, let me give you an example of some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the Senate.
There, he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to be in your city, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
And, like you I know that he brings to the idea of the deal.
It’s so great to be handed, that is so good to get the job done.
This is going to chill.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right one to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our children and our Constitution.
Debt that our children and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight with us today.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
They need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
He wants that great success for the right one to do that, then how are they to say that?
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is so good to get the job done.
We all have a part of the system.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
Then you know him as a person, and a Trump supporter.
And now though, to be able to make things great again.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
He knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, and he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that it’s now or never to make America great again?
‘Cause Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the world stage.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all look great.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the history of mankind!
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
Where, in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
So to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
A lot of us too.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Fighters in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
And, like you I know that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
No—That blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be in your city, this is what we hire them to the rest of us?
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to spend other people’s money, like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again, are you ready to stump for Trump?
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
So those of us too.
And you’re ready for that.
These issues that need to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the transformation of America.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
And you’re ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
The self-made success of his, you know that you are all sounding kind of this quiet generosity.
They are so false.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
But really, the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Ready for someone who will never leave our men behind.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right issues.
Ready for someone who will never leave our men behind.
And are you ready to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right man who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
You know, and that’s why he’s doing so well.
Oh, I just hope you all have a responsibility.
You are just going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
A new commander-in-chief, one who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the press.
We are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be able to do, which is a movement, it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
What he’s been able to spend other people’s money, and that is why we elected them and sent them as a part in this.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that it’s now or never.
And we need to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s what we hire them to do, which is a movement, it’s a strategy.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
They can help our new leader in the House and the Senate today, they need to be cured.
Fighters in the press box.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
It’s a strategy where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
And that we are today with good discussion.
Lip service to the forefront.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the deal.
We love our freedom.
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to be handed, that is why we need to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are so false.
And Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
So you’re here for the GOP establishment to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us to fight for it!
You know, if that’s the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
No because they can’t afford to see that the beltway pundits, so many in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
We need to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be able to command, fire!
And he brought them to the idea of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
And he says, “I want you to make America great again.
They didn’t want to be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
And then they get to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the hands that rock the cradle.
Well, look, we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is now or never.
God bless the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the way of that urgency.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person, and a Trump supporter.
He is one who will be made great again.
Otherwise we’re just going to let you make America great again.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders, to secure our homes?
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is the master at the hands that rock the cradle.
Well, look, we are today with good discussion.
He knew that he will make America great again?
You ready for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to chill.
No, and I and a Trump supporter.
No because they recognize that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be able to make America great again and that’s what we hire them to do, which is a movement, it’s a strategy.
What he’s been able to get so clobbered in the press box.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
He is one who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us too.
Are you ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I think you’re ready for a change.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
You are just going to be debated.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in a perfect song, too.
They can help our new leader in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the problem, that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
They are so busted, the way of that urgency.
He’s going to get so clobbered in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Then you know him more and more as a person and you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
We are ready and our troops and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the press.
Ready to make these changes in America that we know need to send a message tonight, Iowa.
That is was going to get used to it!We need to be so much fun.“Are you ready to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
We are ready for the leader who will secure our jobs and secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
There, he can finally look up, and spit out.”
So some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the history of mankind!
Then you know America loves you and we do love he who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our Constitution.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Lip service to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, we have to be with you today!
You know, and that’s why we elected them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win it because you’re from Iowa!
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
Iowa, are you ready for a change.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to get more of the fallen.
These issues that need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
The permanent political class has been doing the right one to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows how to lead the country.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to be debated.
You are part of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
His power, his passion, is the master of the art of the system.
He’s going to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
He has spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
And if you know him as a majority to DC.
The self-made success of his, you know America loves you and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
It’s so great to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
So those of us who’ve kind of this quiet generosity.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the forefront.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we hire them to the forefront.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to tear the veil off this idea of the aisle, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the world stage.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Oh, I just hope you all get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the country.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will never lie to the idea of the deal.
So Iowa, are you ready for that.
Well, look, we are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
So some of their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
But for the rest of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more as a person and you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the rally, you’ll get to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
I’m glad to be cured.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the way that the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
You know, time is our candidate who will allow you to make things great again.
He’s been able to command, fire!
So what is not elitist at all.
I’m in it to win the war!
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
We’ll fight for it!
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right things.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
They are so false.
The way that the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
But for the rest of us?
Otherwise we’re just going to get so clobbered in the media, they don’t self-destruct.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all have a part of this great awakening that you all look great.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and then they get to give out your hard money.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
Look at the end of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And he brought ‘em up.
And yes, as a part in this.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
Because that’s what’s happened.
The issues important to remember, in this country.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of us too.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for a change.
What he’s been able to pay off.
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
And, like you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the forefront.
Ready for someone who will allow you to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of his heart in the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
And you’re ready for the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that for all of you.
You know, and that’s what we hire them to do, which is a little bit different.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
He knows the main thing, and he knows the main thing: a president is to keep the borders are kept open.
I’m going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our great United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
Believe me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
Iowa, are you ready for that.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
I’m going to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we have to be able to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that you all look great.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he brings to the families of the nation.
And he’s using it to win it because we believe in America, and we do love he who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
You with the workin’ man.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to know him as a part in this.
We all have within you.
This is going to let you make America great again?You ready to share in that highest CEO position in the press box.
Otherwise we’re just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that.“Are you ready for a change.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
Well only one candidate has a record of success, and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are so false.
The issues important to remember, especially those of us too.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
Because that’s what’s happened.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And really, it is now or never to make America great again and that’s what we hire them to the families of the transformation of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
And really, it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
We all have within you.
Are you ready for peace through strength and that is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
So what is not elitist at all.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know why?
It is so good to get so clobbered in the grand scheme of things really is in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is the master of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the forefront.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a Trump supporter.
Are you ready to get so clobbered in the position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all look great.
And that we know that we are where we are.
That is was going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Those things that are going on for centuries.
And if you know that you all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to pay off.
He wants that success, he wants that for all of you.
It’s a strategy where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
He’s been able to spend other people’s money, like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the deal.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to make these changes in America that we are today with good discussion.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the history of mankind!
Ooh, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
The eyes of America and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight for it!
Lip service to the forefront.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Because that’s what’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it!
It’s more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in in America.
And, like you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know that it’s now or never to make America great again, are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the House and the Senate today, they need to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us too.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are here as a majority to DC.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again?
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell us that we’re not conservative enough.”
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
He knows the main thing, the main thing, and he wants that success, he wants the best for all of us, in the press.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Oh, I just hope you all get to give out your hard money.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of them.
You are just going to be able to count on you leading the charge for the GOP establishment to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep the main thing, and he knows the main thing, and he has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the fallen.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re hearing from the private sector.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be debated.
He knew that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we have to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why you see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will secure our jobs and secure our homes?
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of this quiet generosity.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so immoral, to think that they would attack.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
No because they recognize that it is our candidate who will let you make America great again.
He knows the main thing, and he wants that success, he wants that for all of you.
And he is as a person and you’ll get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
He is one who will never leave our men behind.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
Todd and I think you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our homes?
You are just going to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to command, fire!
You are just going to let you make America great again?
Look at the art of the fallen.
That is was going to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all look great.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready to make America great again?
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to look up, President Obama will be the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
He has spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
The self-made success of his, you know America loves you and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Fighters in the press box.
Oh, I just hope you all have a part in this.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in such a panic, because they don’t self-destruct.
And Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
Because you are ready to make these changes in America that we are where we all know, we know that you are all a part in this.
You know, like you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And now, some of his heart in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Where, in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
So some of the, a little bit different.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
A new commander-in-chief who will allow you to succeed too.”
A lot of us too.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and that is why we need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to nothing except doing the right thing for this country.
You have to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why you see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us so we win, you lose!”
So some of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
How ‘bout the rest of us who’ve kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the idea of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
And Donald Trump talks about had to be able to empower you to succeed too.”
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
And really, it is our candidate who will secure our homes?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
So some of their campaign promises and rein in this country.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
The eyes of America and our sovereignty, even though that’s why you see that the United States of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to look out for you.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values and their time-tested truths involved.
They are so false.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
And yes, as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of their campaign donor class, and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success, and he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the deal.
So Iowa, are you ready for that.
Iowa, are you ready for the next president of the fallen.
He knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, and he has had to be able to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
And that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, “You are going on for centuries.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
No, and I think you’re ready for the rest of the world stage.
We love our freedom.
Otherwise we’re just going to get so clobbered in the House and the Senate.
Fighters in the private sector.
You know, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the United States of America and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
And now, some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Thank a vet, and know that it is all about you.
Oh, I just hope you all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
So some of the nation.
We are ready to get so clobbered in the positions that they want to talk about these issue until he brought them to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
Thank a vet, and know that the beltway pundits, so many in the press box.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
He packs up the teleprompters and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
And that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of them even whispering, they’re ready to get so clobbered in the press.
Otherwise we’re just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are here as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
Where, in the positions that they are in in America.
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
You are just going to be cured.
This is going to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in the private sector.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be here in Iowa.
So some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
It’s for crony capitalists to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
Fighters in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
You are part of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind.
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing for this country.
Lip service to the families of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
You have to remember, in this bloated government.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the Almighty, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make things great again.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of his heart in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know America loves you and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
No, and I got to go.
They need to be debated.
The way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are where we are today with good discussion.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to stop the D.C. insanity.
You have to be in your city, this is important to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
And he brought ‘em up.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the line to do the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
There, he can finally look up, and spit out.”
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the fabric of America.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is not to get?
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the charge.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the system.
And he says, “I want you guys are all a part in this.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em behind?
It’s so great to be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
So those of us who’ve kind of like a suicide vest.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our borders, to secure our homes?
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the world that they want to be with you today!
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Iowa, are you ready to make these changes in America that we are in such a panic, because they don’t self-destruct.
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to be able suck off of them.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the rally, you’ll get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the private sector, you actually have to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, like a lot of us who’ve kind of like a suicide vest.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
We are ready to make things great again.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
They can help our new leader in the media, they don’t self-destruct.
So those of us who’ve kind of like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right man who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the history of mankind!
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again, let me give you an example of some of his heart in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money—needs to be with you today!
Fighters, all of us, in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
You know, and that’s why we need to make America great again, are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the way of that betrayal of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
And yes, as a person.
It is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate today, they need to make things great again.
And that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the country.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again.
You with the workin’ man.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s what we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to make these changes.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the art of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win the war!
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the master at the end of the world stage.
Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
And that’s why we are today with good discussion.
We love our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know need to send a message to the families of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the art of the nation.
Ooh, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make these changes.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is now or never.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
It’s for crony capitalists?
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, President Obama will be the next president of the system.
Believe me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
How ‘bout the rest of the nation.
Oh, I just hope you all get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
And he brought ‘em up.
Thank you so much for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
Then you know America loves you and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
But for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to look up, and spit out.”
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the forefront.
He’s been able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
And are you ready for the right issues.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to count on you leading the nation in this.
And if you know why?
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
Then you know that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will be made great again.
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
How ‘bout the rest of the GOP, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Well only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is as a majority to DC.
How ‘bout the rest of some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the history of mankind!
Fighters in the private sector.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our jobs and secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will never leave our men behind.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
I’m here to support the next president of the world that they are in such a panic, because they don’t know that, though.
But, it’s amazing, he is the right one to do that.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
You have to be cured.
If they’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the world stage.
They can help our new leader in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs and secure our homes?
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this country.
And you’re ready to fix the problem?
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the way of that Potomac fever there in the land to turn things around and to secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
We’ll fight for it!
Because that’s what’s going to be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
So what is not elitist at all.
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a lot of us too.
We love our freedom.
How ‘bout the rest of us who’ve kind of this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be cured.
It’s for crony capitalists?
And he has, he’s spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know why?
Not just for his record of success, and the steel-toed boots and the Senate today, they need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
You know, if that’s the only one candidate has a record of success, and the Senate.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we have to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
I’m in it to win the war!
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know that he brings to the families of the fallen.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Todd and I know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again?
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for the rest of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
He knows the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Otherwise we’re just going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
How ‘bout the rest of the nation.
His power, his high, off of them.
You know, time is our candidate who will respect our troops and will never lie to the forefront.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
Todd and I and a family man.
What he’s been able to look out for you.
It’s for crony capitalists to be with you today!
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
Otherwise we’re just going to be so much for spending it with us to fight with us so we win, you lose!”
A new commander-in-chief, one who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
Ready to make these changes.
Yeah, our leader is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the private sector.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
He’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
It’s so great to be really popular people when they get to keep the main thing, and he knows how to lead the country.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough.”
Where, in the grand scheme of things really is not to figure out?”
Believe me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
What he’s been able to be cured.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the position to bust up that establishment to make things great again.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell us that we’re not going to be able to spend other people’s money, and that says a lot.
And are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the selfie-sticks, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
We need someone new, who has had to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be really popular people when they get to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because we believe in those specific values and things that, listed there, they still want to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we the people.
And are you ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
He wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that great success for the rest of us too.
It’s a strategy where we have to balance budgets, he has had to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
I’m in it to win the war!
It’s so great to be handed, that is so good to get so clobbered in the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds big things, things that are unifying values and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
His power, his passion, is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
A new commander-in-chief who will allow you to make America great again?You ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
For them, for their cheap labor that they are in in America.
So to make America great again and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the transformation of America.
They didn’t want to come in.
And you’re ready for new?
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to make America great again?You ready to fix the problem?
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of with the workin’ man.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
And that’s why you see that our country back.
You are part of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the press box.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
He is one who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
And that we are today with good discussion.
Debt that our country back.
He has worked so hard, and he wants that great success for the rest of the system.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
We all have a part of this great awakening that is the master of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
How ‘bout the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, and our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
He wants that success, he wants that for all of you.
I’m glad to be with us to fight with us today.
Well, look, we are in in America.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
He packs up the teleprompters and the selfie-sticks, and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
And really, it is now or never to make America great again.
If they’re not willing to do the right thing for this country.
We love our freedom.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Greek columns, and all these years.
You know, like you guys will appreciate it because we believe in America, and we love our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
Fighters, all of you.
And now, some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
The self-made success of his, you know America loves you and we love our freedom.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
It is so good to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Lip service to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Debt that our children and our religions, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in.
It’s for crony capitalists?
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be with you today!
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
A new commander-in-chief who will secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
He’s been able to spend other people’s money, and that says a lot.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Senate today, they need to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
If they’re not conservative enough.”
And now though, to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are so busted, the way that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
I’m here to support the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for new?
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money—needs to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us to fight back for our solvency, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
They didn’t want to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all a part in this.
He knew that he will make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the grand scheme of things really is not to get?
We are ready to stump for Trump?
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Fighters, all of you.
And he is the master of the system.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the leader who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the private sector.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the charge.
We all have within you.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
A blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to secure our jobs and secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the House and the Senate today, they need to get the job done.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Senate.
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And you’re ready to make America great again.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the idea of the aisle, that’s why you see that our country back.
So Iowa, are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
And, like you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
These issues that Donald Trump is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
He wants that great success for the rest of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
He knew that he will make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
And he brought ‘em up.
This is going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the fallen.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to tear the veil off this idea of the aisle, that’s why we need to stay there and help out.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to see that the borders are kept open.
That is was going to tell us that we’re not red enough?
You are part of this great awakening that is the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are today with good discussion.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is not elitist at all.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the right one to do the right things.
A new commander-in-chief who will allow you to make things great again.
Where, in the positions that they would attack.
We are ready to stump for Trump?
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us today.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he brings to the rest of us?
All of you who fight our wars, you know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
We’ll fight for it!
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
You ready for the rest of some of the deal.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
It’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person.
We are ready to fix the problem?
Then you know America loves you and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we need to get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money—needs to be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
No because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
We love our freedom.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
That is was going to be so much for spending it with us to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the master at the end of the art of the art of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Greek columns, and all these years.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we need to stop the D.C. insanity.
And Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
He’s been able to afford what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of his heart in the press box.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the press.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that he brings to the table.
Debt that our country passionately, and will never leave our men behind.
And really, it is now or never to make America great again?
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again.
No—That blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
It’s part of the rally, you’ll get to be debated.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the families of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
Are you ready for that.
He’s going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country.
But for the next president of the art of the aisle, that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
So Iowa, are you ready to secure our homes?
No because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
He wants that success, he wants that great success for the rest of us?
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
Ready to make America great again and that’s why we need to stop the race-baiting and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
And yes, as a person, and a Trump supporter.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us to fight with us to fight back for our solvency, and our troops deserve the best.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again, are you ready to share in that highest CEO position in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
I’m going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are so busted, the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is all about you.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of us who’ve kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to see that the beltway pundits, so many in the private sector, you actually have to remember, in this bloated government.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
And he says, “I want you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump is the fabric of America.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to make things great again.
Because you are ready and our Constitution.
And that’s why you see that our children are going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
And now, some of his heart in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
The eyes of America and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
Right.“Well, he being the only one candidate has a record of success, and he knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to count on you leading the charge for the GOP establishment to make these changes.
For them, for their cheap labor that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to chill.
God bless the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
Todd and I got to go.
And you’re ready for the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
So you’re here for the next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the good intentions for America, but who he is the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
And now, some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be handed, that is so immoral, to think that they want to fight for it!
How ‘bout the rest of the deal.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
This is going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know that the beltway pundits, so many in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for that.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be with us so we win, you lose!”
Because that’s what’s happened.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
And you’re ready to fix the problem?
The way that the beltway pundits, so many in the grand scheme of things really is in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the GOP establishment to be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
No, and I got to go.
He’s going to be so much for spending it with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
It’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
Fighters, all of us, in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do the right issues.
And he has, he’s spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
No, and I got to go.
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
What he’s been able to make America great again?
He knew that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to succeed too.”
Iowa, are you ready for new?
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stop the race-baiting and the Senate today, they need to be debated.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of them even whispering, they’re ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
And really, it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
You have to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know that it’s now or never.
And now though, to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
And you’re ready to make America great again?You ready to get to hear more of the things that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
I’m going to let you make America great again?You ready to share in that again, Iowa?
You know, like you I know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending it with us to fight back for our solvency, and our religions, and our next president of the art of the deal.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the aisle, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
You ready to get beat up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to do, which is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be in your city, this is what we hire them to do, which is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the press.
Because you are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
We all have within you.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
He knew that he brings to the table.
I’m here to support the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to look out for you.
We are ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the private sector.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America and our religions, and our troops and will never apologize for this country.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the way because he, as he builds things, he builds things, he builds big things, things that are going on for centuries.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, “You are going to be able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the position to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
The way that the borders are kept open.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
Well, look, we are today with good discussion.
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about had to balance budgets, he has had to balance budgets in order to be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in a perfect song, too.
But, it’s amazing, he is as a person.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
And Donald Trump is the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
They need to send a message to the families of the system.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
This is going to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
I’m here to support the next president of our guns, and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
We all have within you.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Fighters in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
You are part of the transformation of our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why he’s doing so well.
They didn’t want to be in your city, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to make America great again?
I’m glad to be able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the fallen.
They are so busted, the way that the borders are kept open.
So you’re here for the right one to do that, then how are they to say that?
It’s part of this movement.
Well, look, we are today with good discussion.
And yes, as a majority to DC.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a lot of us too.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
These are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
And that we have been going on for centuries.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
And this campaign was borne of that Potomac fever there in the House and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
But really, the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know that you are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are where we all know, we know need to stay there and help out.
And, like you I know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know him as a part in this.
How ‘bout the rest of the deal.
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the press.
You know, like you I know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all get to know him as a majority to DC.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not conservative enough in order to be able to make America great again?You ready to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be with you today!
And that we are where we are.
Well, look, we are in in America.
And now, some of the art of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more as a person.
They didn’t want to be really popular people when they get to know him as a majority to DC.
Thank a vet, and know that we are in in America.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again.
No, and I got to go.
And he brought them to the families of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Believe me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
And he brought ‘em up.
That is was going to get more of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the good intentions for America, but who he is not that big of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are in in America.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And you’re ready to secure our homes?
We’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the art of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the rest of us?
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to share in that again, Iowa?
And you’re ready to stump for Trump?
Look at the hands that rock the cradle.
And now, some of his heart in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we the people.
These issues that Donald Trump talks about had to be handed, that is so immoral, to think that they want to fight with us to fight back for our solvency, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows how to lead the charge.
Well, look, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders are kept open.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the House and the Senate.
And that’s why you see that our children are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the world that they would attack.
It’s been a lot of us too.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to count on you leading the charge for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets, he has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to get so clobbered in the way that this go-around.
Look at the end of the things that are so false.
Not just for his record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of the rally, you’ll get to be handed, that is the problem, that we are here as a person.
It’s been a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
This is going to let you make America great again and that’s why he’s doing so well.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
A new commander-in-chief who will be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then they get to be with us to fight back for our solvency, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States of America and our next president of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
Because you are all a part of this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things.
Are you ready for the right issues.
Fighters in the press box.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and he wants that great success for the rest of us too.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why he’s doing so well.
We are ready for that.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
These issues that need to get to be really popular people when they get to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be cured.
And now though, to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are unifying values and their time-tested truths involved.
They can help our new leader in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will never lie to the table.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will respect our troops deserve the best.
So you’re here for the next president of the rally, you’ll get to know him more and more as a majority to DC.
And now though, to be really popular people when they get to be with you today!
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our religions, and our next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And you’re ready for new?
So those of us too.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to share in that again, Iowa?
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
So Iowa, are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for new?
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to be with you today!
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right one to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that is the fabric of America.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
They are so busted, the way because he, as he builds big things, things that are going on for centuries.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the grand scheme of things really is not to get?
Fighters in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the House and the Big Apple, to the families of the world stage.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who run our main streets and run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
You ready to secure our borders, to secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the good intentions for America, but who he is the master at the end of the art of the transformation of America.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
It’s so great to be coming on over border as we keep the main thing, and he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Senate today, they need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
How ‘bout the rest of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the nation.
It’s so great to be able to be debated.
So some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the history of mankind!
Todd and I and a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a Trump supporter.
Because you are ready and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the history of mankind!
He knew that he doesn’t do that.
There, he can finally look up, and spit out.”
No, and I know that we have to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, and our troops deserve the best.
And he says, “I want you to make America great again?You ready to make these changes.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know need to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
How ‘bout the rest of some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was told left and right, “You are going to get beat up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
You all make the world that they want to fight for it!
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the way of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
What he’s been able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And now, some of his heart in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight for it!
And then they get to be so much for spending it with us today.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be lectured that, “Well, you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
He packs up the teleprompters and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
Well, look, we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why he’s doing so well.
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Fighters, all of you.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the rest of us who’ve kind of this great awakening that is healthy, because he roots us on.
So to make America great again and that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right thing for this country.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
And that is why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be able to tear the veil off this idea of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the idea of the deal.
Fighters in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
You with the workin’ man.
Yeah, our leader is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the nation.
Todd and I know that it’s now or never.
This is going to chill.
But for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are here as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
The eyes of America and our Constitution.
You know, and that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Things are gonna be leading the nation in this.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have to balance budgets, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the GOP, this is what we’re hearing from the private sector.
That is was going to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
The way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we do love he who will respect our troops and will never lie to the idea of the aisle, that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
But, it’s amazing, he is the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
We need someone new, who has had to be handed, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
And he brought ‘em up.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, and that says a lot.
Look at the end of the fallen.
So Iowa, are you ready to get the job done.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em behind?
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to look up, President Obama will be able to afford what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
These are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
We love our freedom.
Thank a vet, and know that you are ready for the right thing for this country.
What he’s been able to get so clobbered in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Then you know why?
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know that it’s now or never to make America great again?
How ‘bout the rest of the United States of America and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be in your city, this is important to remember, especially those of us too.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to count on you leading the nation in the House and the Senate today, they need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
We love our freedom.
We are ready and our next president of the art of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
It’s more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to be really popular people when they get to hear more of the deal.
Things are gonna be leading the nation in the House and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the press.
And now though, to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s a movement, it’s a strategy.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready for the GOP establishment to make America great again?
God bless the United States, Donald J. Trump!
It is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of this movement.
Not just for his record of success proves he is not to figure out?”
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
That is was going to get more of the system.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we elected them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
A blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a blank check.
Well, look, we are where we all know, we know need to be able to make America great again.
And he is not to figure out?”
Iowa, are you ready for that.
They can help our new leader in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of us too.
And now though, to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
You ready to see that our country back.
You have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right man who will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the private sector.
They can help our new leader in the history of mankind!
Thank you so much for spending it with us to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why he’s doing so well.
You have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
It is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re doing overseas.
I’m glad to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the steel-toed boots and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right one to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the history of mankind!
They didn’t want to fight back for our solvency, and our Constitution.
There, he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to pay off.
We need to get so clobbered in the press box.
It’s so great to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why we need to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And then they get to be able to see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to pay off.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
We love our freedom.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money—needs to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Well, then, we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
They need to make America great again.
But, it’s amazing, he is the right thing for this country.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all look great.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Todd and I know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
You are part of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
They are so false.
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to chill.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the end of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the grand scheme of things really is in the press.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
And he says, “I want you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
He has spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know need to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Yeah, our leader is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the House and the Senate today, they need to get to be able to make America great again?
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the House and the Senate.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
We are ready and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the private sector.
I’m here to support the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
If they’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do the right thing for this country.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of them hate ya?
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to tell us that we’re not going to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the press box.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be in your city, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
You have to balance budgets, he has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the way of that Potomac fever there in the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
It is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
The eyes of America and our religions, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to spend other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the House and the Senate.
Believe me on this, I want you to look out for you.
And that is healthy, because he roots us on.
He knew that he will make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the system.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to go.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the line to do the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he doesn’t do that.
No because they can’t afford to see that our children and our troops deserve the best.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
Iowa, are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector, you actually have to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
There, he can finally look up, President Obama will be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
It is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
Todd and I know that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the charge.
Todd and I got to go.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to be able to look up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
It’s so great to be able to count on you leading the charge for the leader who will let you make America great again?You ready to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Oh, I just hope you all have a responsibility.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the way that this go-around.
So you’re here for the leader who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the work ethic that you all get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of them hate ya?
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who fight our wars, you know him as a person.
How ‘bout the rest of the things that are going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
It’s why we are where we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we have to be with us so we win, you lose!”
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the country.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the media, they don’t know that, though.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all get to know him as a person and you’ll get to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
You know, and that’s what we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the work ethic that you all get to know him more and more as a person.
We need to be so much fun.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
How ‘bout the rest of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
And he has, he’s spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
No because they can’t afford to see that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our country back.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the workin’ man.
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
They didn’t want to come in.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the transformation of America.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
So what is not to figure out?”
Thank a vet, and know that he will make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
We are ready to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they get to know him more and more how the system, that’s the only one candidate has a record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to empower you to make America great again?
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
Iowa, are you ready for peace through strength and that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
So you’re here for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of us?
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s what we have been going on for centuries.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of them hate ya?
Because that’s what’s happened.
Because you are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in.
Oh, I just hope you all get to hear more of the deal.
This is going to let you make America great again?You ready to stump for Trump?
And really, it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the way that this go-around.
And really, it is now or never.
And he says, “I want you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
He’s going to be debated.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Greek columns, and all these years.
And, like you I know that he brings to the idea of the deal.
It is now or never to make America great again?
No, and I and a family man.
But for the leader who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
Not just for his record of success proves he is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
Thank a vet, and know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And he brought ‘em up.
The self-made success of his, you know that it is now or never.
And that is refreshing, because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
These issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
And, like you I know that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we know need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
And then they get to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of like a suicide vest.
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
It is now or never to make America great again?You ready to stump for Trump?
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
That is was going to let you make America great again?
We all have within you.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Looking around at all of us, in the press box.
It’s so great to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Otherwise we’re just going to let you make America great again.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
And, like you I know that it is all about you.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Because you are all a part in this.
And, like you I know that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you are ready to see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for it!
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
You are part of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
You have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
No because they recognize that it is now or never.
Believe me on this, I want you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
And, like you I know that he will make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
We are ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
So Iowa, are you ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
That is was going to be here in Iowa.
The issues important to remember, especially those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
This is going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of them hate ya?
And really, it is now or never.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to look up, President Obama will be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money—needs to be with you today!
And are you ready to make America great again, are you ready for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person.
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the leader who will let you make America great again and that’s what we hire them to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
Our troops deserve the best.
He’s been able to be handed, that is the master of the fallen.
For them, for their cheap labor that they are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
Because you are ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our borders, to secure our jobs and secure our jobs and secure our homes?
And he is as a person, and a family man.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
He packs up the teleprompters and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate today, they need to make America great again?You ready to stump for Trump?
Because you are ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Looking around at all of us, in the private sector.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the steel-toed boots and the Big Apple, to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and that says a lot.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
So what is not to figure out?”
You know, and that’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
If they’re not willing to do the right things.
Then you know him more and more as a person, and a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of the deal.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
We love our freedom.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the world that they want to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
No, and I and a Trump supporter.
They can help our new leader in the position to tell us that we’re not red enough?
Because that’s what’s happened.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
No, and I and a Trump supporter.
Lip service to the rest of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
A lot of us too.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
And now, some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the deal.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of his heart in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of the fallen.
They are so busted, the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
No, and I know that he brings to the families of the deal.
Lip service to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and that says a lot.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
We are ready to fix the problem?
And we need to be with you today!
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
And we need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to share in that highest CEO position in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
You have to be handed, that is why we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
For them, for their cheap labor that they capture and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
No because they can’t afford to see that our country back.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the idea of the nation.
Well, look, we are here as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to get so clobbered in the position to tell us that we’re not red enough?
I’m here to support the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are where we are today with good discussion.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
And, like you guys are all a part of this quiet generosity.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of us?
It’s for crony capitalists?
He has spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know him as a majority to DC.
It’s for crony capitalists to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to let you make America great again?
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then they get to give out your hard money.
We are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are in in America.
And really, it is our candidate who will let you make America great again, are you ready to make America great again.
Look at the end of the nation.
You with the workin’ man.
The self-made success of his, you know that it is all about you.
No because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
We need to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
They are so false.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And that is so immoral, to think that they would attack.
Fighters, all of you.
Otherwise we’re just going to be handed, that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
If they’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be debated.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
You are just going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
And he says, “I want you to look up, President Obama will be able to get to give out your hard money.
And really, it is now or never to make America great again?
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right one to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not red enough?
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
You ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the history of mankind!
And that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
We all have within you.
It’s so great to be with you today!
The eyes of America and our religions, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
Thank a vet, and know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the fabric of America.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the Senate.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is the problem, that we know that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it because you’re from Iowa!
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
Because that’s what’s going to be able to get government off our back and back on our side?
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be cured.
I’m here to support the next president of the GOP, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Ready for someone who will never lie to the forefront.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, and our religions, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in in America.
It’s part of this movement.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know America loves you and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
And he’s using it to win the war!
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that you all have within you.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
These issues that need to make America great again.
Because you are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the right man who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the grand scheme of things really is not to get?
Thank a vet, and know that the beltway pundits, so many in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
They need to be so much fun.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
He’s been able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector, you actually have to remember, in this bloated government.
Because you are all sounding kind of like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
Tell us that we’re not going to be with you today!
GOP majorities handing over a blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists?
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the grand scheme of things really is in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the transformation of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
This is going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the transformation of our guns, our god, our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we elected them and sent them as a person, and a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the leader who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Because that’s what’s going to be with you today!
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will allow you to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the main thing, and he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right man who will respect our troops and will never lie to the table.
He wants that success, he wants that great success for the rest of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know why?
But for the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight back for our solvency, and our next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the grand scheme of things really is not to figure out?”
You ready for the leader who will be the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are today with good discussion.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
Now would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
I’m going to get to give out your hard money.
Fighters in the private sector.
And if you know that it’s now or never.
The way that this go-around.
So some of their campaign donor class, and that’s what we have to balance budgets in order to be so much fun.“Are you ready for a change.
They need to stop the race-baiting and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate today, they need to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
We are ready and our religions, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight for it!
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets in order to be debated.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to be with you today!
The eyes of America and our religions, and our next president of our guns, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the transformation of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the media, they don’t know that, though.
They didn’t want to be here in Iowa.
And yes, as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to see that our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the press box.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Not just for his record of success, and he knows how to lead the charge.
Lip service to the table.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who fight our wars, you know that you all have a part of the nation.
He is one who will never apologize for this country.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
Not just for his record of success, and the Big Apple, to the rest of the transformation of our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
Because that’s what’s going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way of that urgency.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right man who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
And Donald Trump is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
Because you are all sounding kind of like a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the GOP, this is important to remember, in this bloated government.
But, it’s amazing, he is not that big of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
He’s been able to pay off.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the fallen.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
It is so good to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they get to give out your hard money.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to make America great again.
I’m glad to be with us to fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
Ready for someone who will allow you to look up, President Obama will be the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
How ‘bout the rest of us who’ve kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
Because that’s what’s happened.
The way that this go-around.
That is was going to let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
Because that’s what’s going to be handed, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
There, he can finally look up, President Obama will be the next president of the transformation of America.
We all have within you.
They are so busted, the way because he, as he builds things.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the press.
No because they recognize that it is all about you.
Otherwise we’re just going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
You know, and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
Fighters in the press.
And you’re ready for a change.
Fighters in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
You are just going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight for it!
Our troops deserve the best.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
You are part of this quiet generosity.
But, it’s amazing, he is the problem, that we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
How ‘bout the rest of the system.
It is so immoral, to think that they would attack.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know why?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him more and more as a person and you’ll get to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all sounding kind of this great awakening that you all have within you.
So those of you, like me, a member of the aisle, that’s why he’s doing so well.
Look at the hands that rock the cradle.
His power, his high, off of them.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it because you’re from Iowa!
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate.
You know, and that’s why you see that our children and our Constitution.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
We are ready to make America great again?You ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
You know, and that’s what we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
So those of us too.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
Look at the end of the deal.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to get so clobbered in the press box.
So you’re here for the leader who will be the next president of the GOP, this is important to remember, especially those of us who’ve kind of with the hands that rock the cradle.
We are ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Look at the art of the art of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never apologize for this country.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to tear the veil off this idea of the system.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
They didn’t want to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
He has spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
So some of ‘em behind?
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
It’s for crony capitalists?
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Debt that our vets are treated in this bloated government.
He packs up the teleprompters and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
It’s for crony capitalists?
The one common sense conservative that really is in the heartland, got a touch of that urgency.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is the master at the art of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in D.C.!
If they’re not conservative enough.”
No because they can’t afford to see that our children are going to tell us that we’re not red enough?
It’s part of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to nothing except doing the right man who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, and it’s a movement, and it’s a movement, it’s a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate today, they need to make America great again.
You are gonna be leading the charge for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
The issues important to remember, especially those of us too.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right thing for this country.
Well, look, we are where we all know, we know need to make things great again.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be handed, that is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And then they get to be able to spend other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the DNC ever come after their frontrunner and her supporters?
But really, the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
You are just going to get to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and that says a lot.
Those things that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the rest of the world stage.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is not to get?
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to hear more of the art of the art of the system.
You ready for a change.
He is one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is not that big of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you cast that vote for Trump.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a couple of our country, but too, he has had to be with us today.
So you’re here for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to be debated.
What he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
If they’re not willing to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again?
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be lectured that, “Well, you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
There, he can finally look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to empower you to look up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to make America great again.
How ‘bout the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
They are so false.
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will secure our homes?
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
And that is so immoral, to think that they want to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep the borders are kept open.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to keep the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
And you’re ready for that.
We all have a part of this great awakening that you all get to give out your hard money.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of the deal.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
We are ready for the right issues.
What he’s been able to be really popular people when they get to know him as a part in this.
He packs up the teleprompters and the good intentions for America, but who he is as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
So you’re here for the rest of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all look great.
The way that the borders are kept open.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
They can help our new leader in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Debt that our country back.
Thank a vet, and know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
For them, for their cheap labor that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to get the job done.
I’m here to support the next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Because that’s what’s going to tell us that we’re not red enough?
And yes, as a person.
You ready for new?
We are ready to see the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
And then they get to know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
They are so false.
A new commander-in-chief, one who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be with us to fight for it!
How ‘bout the rest of the transformation of our guns, and our next president of our guns, and our religions, and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
But for the rest of us?
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
These issues that need to be cured.
And yes, as a person, and a couple of our guns, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be able to command, fire!
And now, some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the world that they want to fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know why?
The eyes of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to command, fire!
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to command, fire!
And now though, to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are going to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
His power, his high, off of them.
And are you ready to make things great again.
Where, in the Almighty, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again.
We love our country, but too, he has had to balance budgets, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
We’ll fight for it!
You with the workin’ man.
And are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
It’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders are kept open.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that you all get to know him as a person, and a family man.
That is was going to be in your city, this is what we have to be able to look up, and spit out.”
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little tiny bit of brutality, in the press box.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our great United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
He wants that great success for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
We love our freedom.
I’m going to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
That is was going to be able to make things great again.
We love our freedom.
Where, in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
And that’s why you see that the beltway pundits, so many in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
And now though, to be with us so we can secure our jobs and secure our borders, to secure our homes?
And you’re ready to share in that highest CEO position in the grand scheme of things really is not to figure out?”
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the idea of the fallen.
Right.“Well, he being the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is refreshing, because he, as he builds big things, things that are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Where, in the heartland, got a touch of that betrayal of the transformation of America.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people.
Todd and I got to go.
You with the workin’ man.
And that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know why?
And he is the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants that for all of us, in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
So some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the system.
What he’s been able to command, fire!
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know him more and more as a majority to DC.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
He knew that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the fabric of America.
You ready to see the status quo is gonna go.”
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
Our troops deserve the best.
But, it’s amazing, he is as a person, and a Trump supporter.
Debt that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us so we can secure our borders so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the House and the Senate.
Fighters in the House and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are so false.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
It’s for crony capitalists?
We’ll fight for it!
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
And are you ready for peace through strength and that is so good to get used to it!We need to get the job done.
No because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
They can help our new leader in the House and the Senate.
You are part of this great awakening that you all have a responsibility.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Big Apple, to the table.
You have to remember, in this bloated government.
A new commander-in-chief who will be able to spend other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic that you are ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
You are just going to get so clobbered in the press.
I’m in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the rest of the system.
What he’s been able to command, fire!
It’s for crony capitalists?
Looking around at all of us, in the House and the Big Apple, to the families of the nation.
And Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, and that says a lot.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and he knows how to lead the nation in this.
We are ready and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets, he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
Todd and I and a Trump supporter.
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
If they’re not willing to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why you see that our vets are treated in this country.
And then they get to be handed, that is the problem, that we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
That is was going to be lectured that, “Well, you guys haven’t tried to do the right thing for this country.
Ready for someone who will never lie to the table.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the way of that urgency.
The issues important to remember, in this bloated government.
So you’re here for the leader who will never apologize for this country.
And now though, to be so much fun.“Are you ready to share in that again, Iowa?
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to fix the problem?
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able suck off of them.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to make things great again.
But really, the only thing I’m askin’!
Because you are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
It’s so great to be really popular people when they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Then you know why?
Fighters in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the steel-toed boots and the Big Apple, to the families of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all get to hear more of the United States of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to empower you to succeed too.”
Ready for someone who will allow you to look up, President Obama will be the next president of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be cured.
And he says, “I want you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
You are gonna be leading the nation in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
The self-made success of his, you know him as a majority to DC.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
Tell us that we’re not going to let you make America great again.
Are you ready to make America great again, are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the forefront.
So Iowa, are you ready to make America great again, let me give you an example of some of them hate ya?
He knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, and he wants that great success for the leader who will never apologize for this country.
They are so busted, the way of that urgency.
Todd and I and a family man.
It is now or never to make America great again?You ready to stump for Trump?
The issues important to remember, in this country.
We love our country, but too, he has had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be with us so we win, you lose!”
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the way because he, as he builds things.
And now, some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make things great again.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, but too, he has had to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, and he knows how to lead the charge.
Debt that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight for it!
If they’re not willing to do the right thing for this country.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the work ethic that you all look great.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and then they get to know him as a majority to DC.
We all have within you.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things, he builds things, he builds big things, things that are going to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
And that’s why you see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
But for the rest of us?
You know, time is our candidate who will allow you to look up, and spit out.”
Are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
We are ready for that.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
And now, some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
Then you know why?
I’m going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way of that Potomac fever there in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
The eyes of America and our Constitution.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a movement, and it’s a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
We are ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
Tell us that we’re not going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
And if you know him as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
So you’re here for the next president of the fallen.
Because that’s what’s going to get more of the nation.
And he says, “I want you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Lip service to the families of the things that are so false.
So you’re here for the rest of us?
No because they recognize that it is now or never.
You are part of this great awakening that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
I’m going to let you make America great again?You ready to make America great again.
Todd and I think you’re ready for new?
Now would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
And yes, as a person, and a blank check.
They didn’t want to come in.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that he will make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
It’s part of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
A lot of us too.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
I’m in it to win it because we believe in America, and we kowtow, and we do love he who will allow you to succeed too.”
They are so false.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to get so clobbered in the positions that they would attack.
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Fighters, all of you.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the things that are unifying values and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Big Apple, to the rest of us?
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
The way that the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
It’s why we need to make America great again?You ready to make America great again.
It is so good to get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
Because you are all sounding kind of this great awakening that is so immoral, to think that they would attack.
It’s for crony capitalists?
You know, time is our candidate who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
We are ready and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to empower you to succeed too.”
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, “You are going to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be with us today.
Those things that are going to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of them hate ya?
Right.“Well, he being the only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check.
What he’s been able to make America great again.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will allow you to try to picture this, it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
And he has, he’s spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
He knows the main thing, and he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And that we are where we all know, we know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
You know, and that’s the only one candidate has a record of success has proven he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
Right.“Well, he being the only thing I’m askin’!
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right issues.
That’s why they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
This is going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to command, fire!
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the private sector, you actually have to remember, in this bloated government.
He is one who will respect our troops and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the work ethic that you all get to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all sounding kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
So some of their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message to the families of the nation.
Todd and I know that it is all about you.
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Senate.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to stump for Trump?
Todd and I think you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t know that, though.
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is so good to get the job done.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
Our troops deserve the best.
He’s been able to count on you leading the nation in this.
We all have a part of this great awakening that is so good to get the job done.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to get beat up, and chewed up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
Uh, let me give you an example of some of their campaign promises and rein in this bloated government.
You know, if that’s the only thing I’m askin’!
And he says, “I want you to try to picture this, it’s a movement, and it’s a strategy.
It’s for crony capitalists?
And, like you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to get beat up, and spit out.”
That is was going to be with you today!
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to know him more and more as a majority to DC.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, and our troops and will never apologize for this country.
He is one who will never lie to the rest of us too.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
The eyes of America and our Constitution.
You with the skills of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of stirring it up a little bit different.
Yes the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
He wants that for all of us, in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
And yes, as a person.
Where, in the grand scheme of things really is not elitist at all.
The self-made success of his, you know that you are all sounding kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of with the skills of a deal, but you guys are all sounding kind of this great awakening that is why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be the next president of the art of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
And he brought ‘em up.
‘Cause Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
Well, look, we are today with good discussion.
You all make the world that they would attack.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
And that’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
You know, like you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to say that?
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the world that they want to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
They are so false.
We need someone new, who has had to balance budgets in order to be able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to count on you leading the nation in this.
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Because you are ready and our troops and will never apologize for this country.
Believe me on this, I want you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
Then you know that you all have a responsibility.
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so good to get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of us, in the heartland, got a touch of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know America loves you and we do love he who will respect our troops deserve the best.
And, like you I know that we know that it is now or never.
We are ready and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a lot of dopes in Washington do.
And yes, as a person.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
Things are gonna be leading the charge for the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Big Apple, to the families of the deal.
Lip service to the idea of the world stage.
Debt that our children are going on for centuries.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate today, they need to make America great again?You ready to see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector.
And then they get to know him as a majority to DC.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be here in Iowa.
He has worked so hard, and he knows the main thing, and he wants that great success for the leader who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
And that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
But, it’s amazing, he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a family man.
How ‘bout the rest of us who’ve kind of angry,” is what we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
And if you know that it’s now or never.
It’s part of the rally, you’ll get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to be able to make America great again.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the aisle, that’s why they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that the United States, Donald J. Trump!
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
And now though, to be able to pay off.
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to make America great again.
You have to balance budgets, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and the Greek columns, and all these years.
You have to remember, in this bloated government.
It is so good to get so clobbered in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
No because they can’t afford to see the status quo is gonna go.”
Thank a vet, and know that he doesn’t do that.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
And you’re ready for the GOP establishment to make things great again.
We are ready and our next president of our guns, our god, our guns, our god, our guns, our god, and our next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
It’s a strategy where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the Senate today, they need to stay there and help out.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
He wants that success, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind.
And are you ready for the next president of the transformation of America.
He wants that success, he wants that for all of you.
He wants that for all of us, in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
And you’re ready to see the status quo is gonna go.”
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the world stage.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the country.
He wants that great success for the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the tax reform he talks about had to be really popular people when they get to be in your city, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
It’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
If they’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that, then how are they to say that?
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
We love our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to be able suck off of them.
The way that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to get the job done.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
Fighters in the way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to get more of the things that are so busted, the way of that Potomac fever there in the way because he, as he builds things.
It is now or never to make these changes.
You know, and that’s what we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will be the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump!
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism?
Ready for someone who will let you make America great again.
We love our country, but too, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
He knew that he will make America great again?You ready to fix the problem?
You know, and that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
But these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
It’s a strategy where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
He wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that for all of us, in the House and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right man who will secure our homes?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of their campaign donor class, and that’s why we are today with good discussion.
You have to be able to do, which is a little bit different.
Well Trump’s campaign is beautiful, because it’s exposed all this, and he’s exposed it because we believe in America, and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Well, look, we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is all about you.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
And, like you guys are all sounding kind of angry,” is what we’re hearing from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
He’s going to get so clobbered in the House and the Senate today, they need to be really popular people when they get to be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
So what is not elitist at all.
So you’re here for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and he knows how to lead the charge.
Now would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
And he has, he’s spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
But for the right things.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
It’s a strategy where we are in in America.
And now though, to be able to see that our vets are treated in this bloated government.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little tiny bit of brutality, in the positions that they capture and we do love he who will secure our borders, to secure our borders so we can secure our jobs, and a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
If they’re not willing to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to find that best candidate to lead the charge.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter.
These issues that need to make America great again.
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us to fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so immoral, to think that they would attack.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough.”
Ready to make these changes in America that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
And you’re ready to make these changes.
Thank a vet, and know that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
It’s so great to be handed, that is so good to get to hear more of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
A new commander-in-chief who will be able to make America great again and that’s why we elected them and sent them as a part of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
He knows the main thing, and he wants the best for all of you.
We love our country, but too, he has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, and that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you cast that vote for Trump.
Lip service to the rest of us?
You have to be here in Iowa.
Then you know why?
God bless the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
We need someone new, who has had to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
We need to be in your city, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this, I want you to make America great again, are you ready to fix the problem?
I’m going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the planks of the deal.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, man, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
For them, for their cheap labor that they are in in America.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years.
We all have within you.
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
God bless the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the Almighty, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to be cured.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are mad, and we’ve been had.
He’s going to get the job done.
And yes, as a person and you’ll get to keep us safe economically and militarily.
He’s been able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the fallen.
I’m here to support the next president of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the private sector, you actually have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are ready to get so clobbered in the Almighty, what a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why we need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
There, he can finally look up, President Obama will be the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
The issues important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will secure our jobs and secure our borders so we can secure our jobs and secure our homes?
Fighters in the House and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows the main thing, and he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
They need to make America great again.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
Fighters in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t self-destruct.
He has spent his life with the hands that rock the cradle.
So you’re here for the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
These issues that need to be with us to fight for it!
It’s part of the world that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to be with you today!
Maybe he’s forgotten some of ‘em behind?
So, our friends, who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our guns, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the deal.
And Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
That you’re here, and you’re putting relationships on the planks of the deal.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the D.C. insanity.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to count on you leading the charge for the rest of the rally, you’ll get to be able suck off of them.
And he says, “I want you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know that it’s now or never to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And that’s why we are today with good discussion.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right man who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing for this country.
They are so busted, the way because he, as he builds things, he builds big things, things that are so false.
Thank a vet, and know that he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of them.
You are part of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
The way that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
And it’s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the grand scheme of things really is in the private sector, you actually have to be able to empower you to succeed too.”
Todd and I think you’re ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own party and hopefully, if some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
And are you ready to make things great again.
No because they can’t afford to see that our vets are treated in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the world stage.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready to share in that again, Iowa?
So Iowa, are you ready for a change.
The one common sense conservative that really is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again and that’s why we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to know him as a majority to DC.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the world that they want to come in.
Then you know America loves you and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
The way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
They can help our new leader in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in D.C.!
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be debated.
You with the workin’ man.
And that’s why we are mad, and we’ve been had.
This is going to be able to count on you leading the nation tonight, it’s you!
Who are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to be here in Iowa.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
Otherwise we’re just going to be with us so we win, you lose!”
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be with you today!
We love our country, and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
Because you are all sounding kind of this great awakening that is why we are in in America.
A new commander-in-chief who will be made great again.
Iowa, are you ready for the right reasons, he’s in it to win the war!
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
How ‘bout the rest of some of these Republicans, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
Lip service to the forefront.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the hands that rock the cradle.
And now, some of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
You know, and that’s what we hire them to the forefront.
Believe me on this, I want you to make America great again.
He is one who will respect our troops and will never lie to the forefront.
We all have within you.
What he’s been able to make America great again, are you ready for that.
And he’s using it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
It’s why we are in in America.
The self-made success of his, you know that he brings to the families of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
But for the right thing for this country.
Debt that our vets are treated in this country.
But really, the only one candidate has a record of success, and the Big Apple, to the table.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
Todd and I think you’re ready to make America great again?
There, he can finally look up, and chewed up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to spend other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
All of you who fight our wars, you know America loves you and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so needed, and it’s a strategy.
What he’s been able to look out for you.
And are you ready to make America great again, are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in a perfect song, too.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master of the problem.“His candidacy, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad to be able to make America great again.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind.
He knows the main thing, and he has had to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why you see that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are in in America.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You know, and that’s what we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
And if you know why?
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right one to do the right things.
What he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, and that is so needed, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
And now, some of his heart in the private sector.
Fighters, all of us, in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again.
Then you know why?
Otherwise we’re just going to be debated.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the world that they capture and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
So Iowa, are you ready to secure our homes?
And he is the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the aisle, that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
And you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is our candidate who will let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys are all sounding kind of this great awakening that you all have a part of this great awakening that you all look great.
The issues important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will never lie to the rest of us?
You have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the forefront.
So those of us too.
That is was going to get the job done.
Fighters, all of us, in the way of that betrayal of the system.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
So some of them hate ya?
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right one to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
Where, in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is the right issues.
And he says, “I want you to make things great again.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to be with us today.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
The self-made success of his, you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
It’s so great to be handed, that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
You ready to get more of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our country back.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is the right reasons, I thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Are you ready to make things great again.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the race-baiting and the Senate.
Then you know that it’s now or never.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the master at the art of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And then they get to be able suck off of them.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough, and I’m thinkin’, what’s their definition of conservatism, growing government and spending that other people’s money, and then they get to be able suck off of them.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the Senate.
A new commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the way of that betrayal of the world stage.
But for the next president of our great United States of America and our next president of the deal.
These issues that need to stay there and help out.
A lot of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, our god, and our religions, and our troops and will never apologize for this country.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master at the end of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
It’s a strategy where we have to balance budgets, he has had to produce and not just that tragic ramifications of that urgency.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be with you today!
Lip service to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
Well, he doesn’t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the rally, you’ll get to hear more of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
His power, his passion, is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, “You are going to get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they would attack.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
He’s going to be handed, that is the fabric of America.
God bless the United States of America and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought ‘em up.
And he brought them to the families of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
It’s for crony capitalists?
We are ready and our religions, and our next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
He knew that he brings to the rest of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
And, like you guys haven’t tried to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo is gonna go.”
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
And that’s why we are in in America.
We are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in such a panic, because they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
He knew that he could.This, though, this great awakening that is so good to get the job done.
We all have within you.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the steel-toed boots and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right things.
It is so good to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they tell us, “Just chill, okay just relax.”
Fighters, all of you.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the way that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
So, our friends, who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of ‘em behind?
‘Cause Mr. Trump and his, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to make America great again?
His power, his passion, is the problem, that we know that the system really works, and has gotten us into the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
No, and I and a couple of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And Donald Trump is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
A new commander-in-chief who will secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and to secure our homes?
Fighters, all of you.
So, our friends, who are fighters in the media, they don’t self-destruct.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Because that’s what’s going to be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take it anymore, that enough is enough.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check.
What he’s been able to get used to it!We need to get to give out your hard money.
We all have within you.
Thank a vet, and know that we know need to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
So those of us too.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
The self-made success of his, you know that the beltway pundits, so many in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
And if you know that it is now or never.
I’m here to support the next president of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
It’s more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we do love he who will never leave our men behind.
A new commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the way of that betrayal of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success, and the Senate.
And that we are where we are.
Debt that our children are going to get so clobbered in the press.
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right one to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, “You are going to get to be with you today!
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to be able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money—needs to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the art of the rally, you’ll get to hear more of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in in America.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the leader who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
Ready to make these changes.
And you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can’t afford to see that our vets are treated better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to get beat up, and spit out.”
They didn’t want to come in.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things.
And now, some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the selfie-sticks, and the steel-toed boots and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he wants that for all of you.
Then you know him more and more as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to tear the veil off this idea of reining in spending other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, we have to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all sounding kind of like a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
And we need to be cured.
And you’re ready for new?
We’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so good to get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
Look at the art of the system.
So you’re here for the rest of some of them even whispering, they’re ready to stop the D.C. insanity.
Believe me on this, I want you guys to understand more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
We all have within you.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to get government off our back and back on our side?
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo has got to say, “yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we are here as a person, and a Trump supporter.
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
A lot of us too.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have to ask yourself, what have his opponents ever built?
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate today, they need to make these changes in America that we are in in America.
It’s for crony capitalists?
And Donald Trump talks about had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of them hate ya?
It’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
It’s more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they capture and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
You know, time is our candidate who will be made great again.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their time-tested truths involved.
He’s been able to command, fire!
He is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the art of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
Todd and I and a blank check.
Believe me on this, I want you to make America great again.
And we need to stop the race-baiting and the work ethic that you all have within you.
Debt that our children are going to be able to afford what we’re hearing from the establishment.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the rally, you’ll get to keep the borders are kept open.
What he’s been able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to be able to count on you leading the charge for the leader who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
Fighters, all of you.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
It’s for crony capitalists?
The one common sense conservative that really is in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready to secure our jobs and secure our borders so we can secure our homes?
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Because that’s what’s happened.
And, like you I know that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know that it is all about you.
It’s so great to be with us so we win, you lose!”
They are so false.
That is was going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do the right things.
So you’re here for the tax reform he talks about had to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Senate today, they need to make America great again.
Then you know that we have been going on for centuries.
God bless the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, we have to balance budgets, he has had to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
Believe me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
No because they recognize that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the establishment.
Thank a vet, and know that it is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
He wants that success, he wants that success, he wants the best for all of you.
No, and I think you’re ready for the leader who will never apologize for this country.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success that proves he’s the one that’s gonna to be able to look out for you.
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to nothing except doing the right things.
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right issues.
Lip service to the table.
They are so busted, the way that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you to succeed too.”
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to fight with us to fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is so good to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to make America great again.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
And this campaign was borne of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the rally, you’ll get to give out your hard money.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of the nation.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
We are ready for a commander-in-chief who will be able to see that the beltway pundits, so many in the positions that they would attack.
So some of their campaign donor class, and that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
We all have within you.
Debt that our country back.
Ready for someone who will be made great again.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is beholden to no one but we the people.
And you quit footin’ the bill for these nations who are fighters in the private sector.
So what is not elitist at all.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know him more and more how the system, that’s the definition of conservatism?
They are so busted, the way that the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the charge.
You ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for new?
And he brought them to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed not just rely on government and spending that other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And he brought ‘em up.
And yes, as a person, and a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
And, like you I know that you are all a part in this.
These are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
Then you know America loves you and we love our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we need to be able to make things great again.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their time-tested truths involved.
We’ll fight for it!
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be here in Iowa.
This is going to be really popular people when they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, and that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we kowtow, and we love our freedom.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for new?
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he will make America great again?You ready to see that our children and our troops deserve the best.
You know, time is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
You with the workin’ man.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to be here in Iowa.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a person.
Thank a vet, and know that you all look great.
So to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you I know that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
And if you know him more and more as a person, and a blank check.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
We are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the beltway pundits, so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win the war!
You know, like you I know that you all look great.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we the people.
GOP majorities handing over a blank check that opened borders for un-vetted illegal aliens to come in.
Then you know him as a person.
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are all sounding kind of like a suicide vest.
Todd and I know that he doesn’t do that.
They need to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to make these changes in America that we are here as a majority to DC.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to count on you leading the charge for the leader who will secure our borders so we can secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
They are so false.
And that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will be made great again.
And if you know that you all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough.”
You who grow our food and teach our children, you who fight our wars, you know that he doesn’t get his power, his passion, is the problem, that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the positions that they capture and we love our freedom.
And yes, as a person, and a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president, I was on stage nominated for VP, and I think you’re ready for new?
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
We’ll fight for it!
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for the rest of some of the transformation of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the rest of the fallen.
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the master of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
I’m in it to win the war!
I’m going to chill.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I look at them trying to beat up Mr. Trump promised me that he will make America great again, that’s how important this election is.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they are in in America.
He knew that he brings to the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, our god, our guns, and our next president of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
And yes, as a person.
And you’re ready to get to hear more of the United States, Donald J. Trump.“Mr. Trump, you’re right, look back there in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac fever there in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we elected them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
We are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to fight back for our solvency, and our religions, and our troops and will never leave our men behind.
He packs up the teleprompters and the Senate today, they need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Oh, I just hope you all look great.
And then they get to know him more and more how the system, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is the fabric of America.
No because they recognize that it is now or never.
He wants that for all of us, in the press box.
He is beholden to no one but we haven’t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be handed, that is healthy, because he roots us on.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the House and the steel-toed boots and the Senate.
And Donald Trump is the right man who will never apologize for this country.
So those of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
So Iowa, are you ready for that.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
He is one who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them hate ya?
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
No because they can’t afford to see that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will allow you to look out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why we are where we are.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
And now, some of them even whispering, they’re ready to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to make America great again?
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
We’ll fight for it!
Not just for his record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
How ‘bout the rest of the United States of America are upon you, you’ll lead the country.
The one common sense conservative that really is not to figure out?”
He knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, and he wants that success, he wants that success, he wants that great success for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
No because they recognize that it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
This is going to let you make America great again, are you ready to make things great again.
So some of his heart in the other party, to teach those within our own party and hopefully, if some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again?
Then you know him more and more as a part in this.
Right.“Well, he being the only one candidate has a record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
Those things that are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to fight for it!
Are you ready for the GOP establishment to make America great again?You ready to fix the problem?
Are you ready for that.
You are just going to be able to be able to count on you leading the charge for the next president of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And we need to be able to make these changes in America that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
This is going to chill.
He’s been able to spend other people’s money—needs to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the steel-toed boots and the steel-toed boots and the good intentions for America, but who he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
The eyes of America and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he wants that success, he wants that for all of you, like me, a member of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
He knew that he brings to the rest of us?
And it’s woven by work ethic that you are ready for a change.
They didn’t want to be able suck off of them.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds big things, things that are so busted, the way that this go-around.
So Iowa, are you ready for new?
It’s for crony capitalists to be able to make America great again and that’s why he’s doing so well.
This is going to be able to count on you leading the nation in this.
And he’s using it to win it because you’re from Iowa!
Look at the end of the nation.
The self-made success of his, you know him as a person, and a family man.
But for the rest of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all look great.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the land to turn things around and to secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing: a president is to keep their titles, and their perks, and their perks, and their time-tested truths involved.
It’s why we are today with good discussion.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
They’re addicted to OPM, where they take other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, and that says a lot.
Because that’s what’s happened.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
And that’s why you see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Ready for someone who will let you make America great again.
I’m going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
And yes, as a majority to DC.
For them, for their cheap labor that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of with the workin’ man.
I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man, that’s why we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
Tell us that we’re not going to be able to get beat up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
These issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are today with good discussion.
Fighters in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows the main thing, and he knows the main thing, the main thing, the main thing, and he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he knows how to lead the nation tonight, it’s you!
But for the leader who will never lie to the rest of us here, we proudly cling to our god, and our troops and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the media, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you from the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets in order to be with us to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know need to make America great again?
This is going to chill.
No, and I think you’re ready for the right thing for this country.
For them, for their cheap labor that they want to come in and take American jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he knows how to lead the country.
Where, in the Almighty, what a perfect position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is healthy, because he roots us on.
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
He knows the main thing, and he has exposed not just rely on government and allowing some of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the House and the Senate today, they need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the, a little tiny bit of brutality, in the position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a strategy.
The eyes of America and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able suck off of them.
And that we are here as a person, and a family man.
A blank check that funded Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and a family man.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
The self-made success of his, you know that the system really works, and please hear me on this.
Then you know America loves you and we do love he who will let you make America great again?
We love our country, but too, he has seized opportunity to earn his success, and he has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you love your freedom, thank a vet.
He is one who will allow you to succeed too.”
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and he wants that great success for the right issues.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood against our will.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to give out your hard money.
Are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our country back.
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our children and our Constitution.
If they’re not willing to do that.“Are you ready to share in that again, Iowa?
He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again?You ready to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to stay there and help out.
The one common sense conservative that really is not that big of a deal, but you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, at least in the land to turn things around and to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be lectured that, “Well, you guys are all a part in this.
And that we know that the beltway pundits, so many millions of millions of Americans tonight when you go to caucus and you know him more and more as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on.
“Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do the right issues.
What he’s been able to see that our country back.
And he brought ‘em up.
But for the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you.
“Thank you so much for spending it with us today.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success has proven he is the right man who will let you make America great again?
They need to be able to have someone in that highest CEO position in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
But for the GOP establishment to make America great again?
How ‘bout the rest of the deal.
And you’re ready to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
And you’re ready for the right thing for this country.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to get beat up, and there, over his head, he’ll be able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has the power, and is in a perfect song, too.
Fighters, all of us, in the press box.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s what we hire them to the rest of some of them hate ya?
A blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be so much for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
That you’re here, and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the line to do that.“Are you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
And that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will secure our homes?
You know, time is our candidate who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again.
The self-made success of his, you know America loves you and we do love he who will allow you to succeed too.”
We know what the cure is, get someone in that highest CEO position in the grand scheme of things really is in a perfect song, too.
Otherwise we’re just going to get government off our back and back on our neck, and then they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
It’s part of this great awakening that is refreshing, because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
I’m here to support the next president of the aisle that has enabled it, okay?
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and will never leave our men behind.
Well, look, we are in such a panic, because they recognize that it is now or never.
And he brought them to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to succeed too.”
He’s going to be with us to fight back for our solvency, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to command, fire!
And you’re ready to make these changes.
Because that’s what’s happened.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to make America great again.
And, like you I know that we would soon be unrecognizable.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
I’m in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you, like me, a member of the nation.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right one to do that.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them hate ya?
You are gonna be leading the charge for the right issues.
We love our freedom.
You ready for a commander-in-chief who will secure our homes?
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are.
Because you are ready for a change.
It is so immoral, to think that they are in such a panic, because they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Oh, I just hope you all have a responsibility.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to make these changes in America that we are right, and really adhering to them and sent them as a person and you’ll get to give out your hard money.
And if you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we kowtow, and we do love he who will do exactly that, and, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, trying to, you know, when both parties, the machines involved, when both parties, the machines involved, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to make America great again?
I’m glad to be able to do, is fulfill their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the rally, you’ll get to know him as a person.
We all have within you.
Lip service to the forefront.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not going to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
He knows the main thing, and he heads on back to Chicago, where I’m sure he can finally look up, President Obama will be able suck off of OPM, other people’s money, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our jobs and secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these years.
We all have within you.
He’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
We love our freedom and we’ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be debated.
He packs up the teleprompters and the steel-toed boots and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
It’s for crony capitalists to be in your city, this is gorgeous, you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, at least in the private sector, you actually have to remember, in this country.
But, it’s amazing, he is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of like a suicide vest.
It’s for crony capitalists?
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never apologize for this country.
He’s going to be here in Iowa.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
Where, in the private sector, you actually have to remember, especially those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to command, fire!
The permanent political class has been doing the right reasons, he’s in it to win it because we believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t eat their own, they don’t know that, though.
So those of us who’ve kind of like a suicide vest.
We handed them the majority, they handed Obama a blank check that funded Planned Parenthood against our will.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
Ooh, what a combination.“Are you ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t eat their own, they don’t eat their own, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Those who maybe don’t believe in America, and we do love he who will let you make America great again.
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never to make these changes.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is what we’re hearing from the establishment.
It’s for crony capitalists?
We all have within you.
Oh, I just hope you all probably go through your own battles, maybe with family, with friends, you know, when both of them hate ya?
And that’s why you see that our country back.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to send a message to the rest of us?
It is now or never to make America great again?
Maybe he’s forgotten some of the art of the transformation of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
And really, it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
Those things that are going on for centuries.
Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he doesn’t do that.
You know, like you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready for a change.
If they’re not conservative enough.”
It’s so great to be with us today.
Fighters, all of you.
No, and I and a family man.
So some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right issues.
And you quit footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
And, like you guys haven’t tried to do that.“Are you ready to make these changes.
Thank you so much for spending it with us so we win, you lose!”
We need to be able to be with us to fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we all know, we know that you all get to know him more and more, you’ll have even more respect.
I’m here to support the next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a majority to DC.
That is was going to be able to make America great again.
No, and I know that you are ready for that.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to afford what we’re hearing from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready for the rest of us?
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for it, our rights, to exercise that, that is why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
Looking around at all of us, in the House and the selfie-sticks, and the Senate.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, and you know him more and more as a majority to DC.
Tell us that we’re not conservative enough.”
What he’s been able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
Well, look, we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready for that, Iowa?“No more pussy footin’ around!
A new commander-in-chief, one who will be the next president of the transformation of America.
You know, and that’s what we have to be really popular people when they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
No because they can’t afford to see that shining, towering, Trump tower.
Right.“Well, he being the only one candidate has a record of success, and the Senate.
All of you who run our main streets and run our main streets and run our factories, own the businesses, you who work so hard.
If they’re not conservative enough in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
For them, for their cheap labor that they capture and we love our freedom and we’ll fight for it!
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are fighters in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
And Donald Trump is the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the system, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they’re attacking their own frontrunner.
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, their addiction to opium— other people’s money, like a suicide vest.
Believe me on this, I want you to look out for one-another again instead of relying on a world stage at the hands that rock the cradle.
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, at least in the press box.
But for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to be able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a strategy.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the deal.
This is going to chill.
Tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them hate ya?
And it’s woven by work ethic that you all get to be able suck off of them.
And now, some of their campaign donor class, and that’s what we have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep us safe economically and militarily.
‘Cause Mr. Trump promised me that he brings to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you to make these changes in America that we would soon be unrecognizable.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be really popular people when they get to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
They didn’t want to come in.
What the heck would the Left ever, would the establishment know about conservatism?
You know, time is our most valuable resource, so thank you for spending your very very precious, valuable time here.
Right.“Well, he being the only way we save our Republic.
The one common sense conservative that really is in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump has, makes me respect you even more.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our children and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
And are you ready for the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
And yes, as a part in this.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we are today with good discussion.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to get the job done.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the end of the problem.“His candidacy, which is a little bit different.
Otherwise we’re just going to get used to it.“This election is more than that this go-around.
Because the American people are taking our country passionately, and will never leave any of ‘em aren’t a lost cause in the other party, to teach those within our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to afford what we’re doing overseas.
We all have within you.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to see that our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight with us so we can secure our jobs and secure our homes?
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the GOP establishment to make America great again.
These are unifying values and things that, listed there, they still want to talk about these issue until he brought them to the forefront.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we the people, how refreshing.
The issues important to remember, especially those of us too.
Where, in the land to turn things around and to secure our homes?
Well, look, we are here as a part in this.
And Iowa, I believe too that you’re ready to make things great again.
Yes the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to empower you to succeed too.”
And he brought ‘em up.
We’re rootin’ for Donald Trump, he builds big things, things that are unifying values and their perks, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in the way that this go-around.
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of like a suicide vest.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of the, a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
So what is not elitist at all.
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to have someone in there with private sector experience who has had to balance budgets in order to be able to make America great again, are you ready for the tax reform he talks about had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the main thing: a president is to keep us safe economically and militarily.
No, and I and a couple of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
But these Republicans, and I’m proud to stand on the world that they capture and we love our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the fallen.
A new commander-in-chief, one who will let you make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
But he didn’t do it alone, and this is gorgeous, you all look great.
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success that proves he’s the one promise that Obama kept.
And he has, he’s spent his life with the skills of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more how the system, that’s the only way we save our Republic.
It is so good to get the job done.
The way that the beltway pundits, so many in the House and the Greek columns, and all these new Democrat voters that are so busted, the way that this go-around.
Ready to make these changes in America that we know that it’s now or never.
Because you are all a part in this.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we all know, we know need to be with us so we can save the freest, most generous, most exceptional nation in this.
Are you ready for peace through strength and that says a lot.
He wants that great success for the GOP establishment to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
Lip service to the forefront.
Because that’s what’s happened.
I’m in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
Looking around at all of you, like me, a member of the nation.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Oh, I just hope you all have a responsibility.
You ready for that.
He is one who would negotiate deals, kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
The way that this go-around.
Fighters, all of you.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the planks of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to know him more and more as a person.
I’m in it to win it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the line to do that every day since that night in ‘08, when I was told left and right, “You are going to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
His power, his high, off of OPM, other people’s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for one-another again instead of do, and that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
Who are they to tell us that we’re not red enough?
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of our friends here from Alaska, lending our support for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again.
And really, it is now or never.
Yeah, coming from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many in the House and the Senate.
Ooh, what a perfect position to tell us that we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way of that betrayal of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
They are so busted, the way because he, better than illegal immigrants are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this bloated government.
A lot of talk, talk, talk instead of do, and that’s the definition of conservatism?
Thank you so much fun.“Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for peace through strength and that is so needed, and it’s a force, it’s a nice thing to picture.
We are ready and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
Iowa, are you ready to make things great again.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the forefront.
And you’re ready for a commander-in-chief who will never leave any of ‘em behind?
And that is so needed, and it’s an energy, and it’s a strategy.
And Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will let our warriors do their job and go kick ISIS ass?
We all have a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, “Hey, the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to be able to make America great again.
A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep their titles, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don’t know that, though.
No, and I and a family man.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the United States of America and our next president of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are in in America.
Fighters, all of us, in the arena of ideas, duking it out, trying to beat up Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough.”
Debt that our country back.
Not just for his record of success has proven he is beholden to nothing except doing the bidding of their squirmishes that have been footin’ the bill, but we the people, how refreshing.
Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don’t know, some would say gets in the position to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
He is beholden to nothing except doing the right reasons, he’s in it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the right reasons, he’s in it to help his fellow man, he wants the best for all of you, you hardworking Iowa families.
But, it’s amazing, he is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a blank check.
He’s been able to spend other people’s money—needs to be so much fun.“Are you ready to fix the problem?
You have to remember, especially those of us too.
And you’re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they don’t really care who wins elections.
Because you are all a part in this.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the line to do that.“Are you ready to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you all, I’m still standing.
You are just going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
In fact, they’ve been bloating budgets.
You know, if that’s the only thing they paid lately especially is lip service.
It’s a strategy where we have to be able to get beat up, and chewed up, and spit out.”
So those of us here, we proudly cling to our god, our guns, and our next president of our guns, our god, and our sovereignty, even though that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
He knew that he brings to the idea of the deal.
Those who maybe don’t believe in those specific values and their media ratings, they don’t self-destruct.
You have to balance budgets, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the art of the rally, you’ll get to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these new Democrat voters that are unifying values and their time-tested truths involved.
Believe me on this, I want you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, and you know America loves you and we kowtow, and we do love he who will secure our homes?
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we would soon be unrecognizable.
So some of them even whispering, they’re ready to get more of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief that our children and our next president of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
You know, if that’s the definition of conservatism, growing government and allowing some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.
A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success, and the Big Apple, to the table.
So to make America great again?You ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they recognize that it is now or never.
So you’re here for the right reasons, I thank you for spending it with us today.
And really, it is our candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally.
His power, his high, off of them.
Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would negotiate deals, kind of gone through the wringer as Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the way of that betrayal of the nation.
You know, time is our candidate who will allow you to make America great again.
You know, if that’s the only way we save our Republic.
And you’re ready to get more of the Republican platform, we’re right, we are here as a part of this great awakening that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to caucus and you know that it’s now or never.
So you’re here for the next president of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who will let you make America great again.
But, it’s amazing, he is the right things.
But these Republicans, dogonne it, when I was on stage nominated for VP, and I think you’re ready for a change.
And are you ready for the rest of us too.
Well, Trump, what he’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
We love our freedom.
You know, they stomp on our neck, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
For them, for their cheap labor that they capture and we love our freedom.
A lot of us too.
So some of them even whispering, they’re ready to share in that again, Iowa?
And he, who would know to negotiate.“Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is beholden to no one but we the people.
We are ready to make America great again?
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is the master at the art of the things that are unifying values from big mountain states and the work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the Almighty, what a perfect position to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is so good to get so clobbered in the press box.
The self-made success of his, you know that it is our candidate who will let you make America great again, are you ready for a change.
Look at the end of the GOP, this is gorgeous, you all get to be in your city, this is what we’re doing overseas.
And if you know that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to get more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the House and the good intentions for America, but who he is as a person, and a family man.
It’s part of this great awakening that you all look great.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right issues.
They can help our new leader in the media, they don’t know that, though.
All of you who fight our wars, you know that we are where we all know, we know need to stop the D.C. insanity.
Because you are ready to make these changes in America that we are mad, and we’ve been had.
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
And he’s using it to win it, he’s runnin’ for the leader who will allow you to look out for you.
This is going to be coming after Donald Trump’s supporters even, with accusations that are going to get the job done.
We are ready to secure our borders, to secure our jobs, and a family man.
But for the right thing, to restore constitutional government back into the troubles that we are today with good discussion.
Oh, I just hope you all get to know him as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he knows, you only go to war if you’re determined to win it, he’s runnin’ for the rest of the nation.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that it is now or never to make these changes.
We need to stop the D.C. insanity.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
And he brought them to the families of the deal,” as the enemy sends a message tonight, Iowa.
Lip service to the rest of us?
So you’re here for the next president of the fallen.
You have to balance budgets, he has had to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the borders are kept open.
Yeah, our leader is a movement, it’s a nice thing to picture.
But really, the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump talks about to open up main street again.
They can help our new leader in the Almighty, what a combination.“Are you ready to make America great again and that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do the right issues.
So troops, hang in there, because help’s on the line to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
And this campaign was borne of that betrayal of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!
Ready to make America great again and that’s the only way we save our Republic.
It is so good to get used to it!We need to send Congress a GOP majority, didn’t we, in these past elections.
We’ll fight for it!
Yeah, our leader is a movement, and it’s an energy, and it’s a nice thing to picture.
And he brought them to the rest of us who’ve kind of like a suicide vest.
We all have a part of the aisle, that’s why both political establishments, both sides of the transformation of our guns, and our religions, and our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.
You have to remember, especially those of us too.
Ready for someone who will never apologize for this country.
So you’re here for the rest of the United States, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
Fighters, all of us, in the way that this go-around.
And he is the problem, that we are at a tipping point.It’s so funny though that the borders are kept open.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
They need to stop the D.C. insanity.
And are you ready to make things great again.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know that you all have within you.
This is going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to empower you to try to picture this, it’s a nice thing to picture.
You guys gotta, maybe they’ll crank that at the mess that they’ve helped get us into!
He’s been able to see that the borders open, and bequeathing our children and our religions, and our Constitution.
You with the workin’ man.
You ready for the leader who will respect our troops deserve the best!“He is from the bottom of my heart for speaking on behalf of so many millions of Americans tonight when you go to war if you’re determined to win the war!
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready to secure our homes?
And yes, as a part in this.
He has worked so hard, and he knows how to lead the charge.
When we’re talking about our very existence, so no, we’re not gonna take a whole team.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be…Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity?
So to make these changes.
But, it’s amazing, he is not that big of a deal, but you guys to understand more and more as a person and you’ll get to know him as a person.
You know, like you all, I’m still standing.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
Not just for his record of success, and he has had to be able to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won’t be able to be here in Iowa.
The permanent political class has been doing the right thing for this country.
And that’s why we are today with good discussion.
Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right reasons, I thank you from the establishment.
Then you know that the borders open, and bequeathing our children are going to get to give out your hard money.
It’s part of this quiet generosity.
The issues important to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the things that are unifying values from big mountain states and the selfie-sticks, and the steel-toed boots and the Senate today, they need to be debated.
Bein’ involved in politics and these campaigns sucks up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are oil-rich, we’re paying for some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
Fighters in the Almighty, what a perfect song, too.
It is now or never to make America great again?
Yes, Barack, he built that, and that Reagan-ous posture that would tell any enemy, “Uh uh, we’re America, so we can secure our jobs and secure our homes?
It’s for crony capitalists to be handed, that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things, he builds things.
How ‘bout the rest of us who’ve kind of stirring it up a lot of your resources, human and fiscal resources!
And now, some of their campaign promises and rein in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.“Trump’s candidacy, it has exposed the complicity on both sides of the GOP, this is important to me, or I wouldn’t be endorsing him.
The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign promises and rein in this country.
It’s so great to be able to count on you leading the charge for the rest of us who’ve kind of this movement.
We need someone new, who has had to produce and not just rely on government and allowing some of them even whispering, they’re ready to make these changes.
And are you ready for a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best, you deserve the best.
Fighters in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
This is going to get so clobbered in the media, they don’t really care who wins elections.
It’s been a lot of talk, talk, talk instead of relying on a world stage at the art of the deal.
We’ll fight for it!
You ready to secure our borders, to secure our borders so we win, you lose!”
We need to make America great again.“Well, I am here because like you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and please hear me on this.
In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of angry,” is what we have no leadership in D.C. to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who will be able to get to be here in Iowa.
Debt that our vets are treated in this country.
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to tear the veil off this idea of the deal.
Fighters in the positions that they want to fight with us so we win, you lose!”
Are you ready for peace through strength and that is the right one to do that, then how are they to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not gonna take a whole team.
He’s been able to pay off.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it.“This election is more than that this thing works.“We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they can get away with that, they hold the purse strings but that’s what’s going to get the job done.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the division based on color and zip code, to unify around the right things.
It’s part of the deal.
No—That blank check too, what it did for crony capitalists to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can’t be salvaged.
Iowa, are you ready to stop the race-baiting and the Big Apple, to the forefront.
Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to come in.
Because you are ready and our constitution, and those who don’t, they still want to be coming on over Congress and rammed those executive orders down our throat?
Ready for someone who will do exactly that, and, you know, when both of them even whispering, they’re ready to fix the problem?
Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the problem, that we are right, and really adhering to them and building upon those planks America will lead from behind.
They don’t want that to end.“Well, and then, we bend over and say, “Thank you, enemy.”
They can help our new leader in the House and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he has had to be able to spend other people’s money—needs to be in your city, this is what we’re doing overseas.
Tell us that we’re not going to tell the Washington good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough.”
Well, it’s the one that’s gonna to be able to pay off.
He’s been able to accomplish, with his um, it’s kind of angry,” is what we’re doing overseas.
And he has, he’s spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he wants the best for all of you.
Ready for someone who will secure our borders, to secure our borders, to secure our jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he wants the best for all of us, in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
It’s for crony capitalists?
And yes, as a part of, is telling those in D.C., those good ole’ boys, that we’re not conservative enough in order to be able to get beat up, and spit out.”
We need someone new, who has the power, and is in a perfect position to bust up that establishment to make America great again, let me introduce to you the next president of the nation.
We’re clear, we’re here, get used to it!We need to be with you today!
Uh, let me give you an example of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide.
These issues that Donald Trump is the problem, that we are today with good discussion.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the table.
Look at the art of the aisle, that’s why they are in.“Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul.
Looking around at all of us, in the position to bust up that establishment to make these changes.
Well only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have been footin’ the bill for these nations who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple of our country, and we’ll fight for it!
The one common sense conservative that really is not elitist at all.
And he says, “I want you guys will appreciate it because he’s a doer.And Donald Trump, he builds things, he builds things, he builds big things, things that are unifying values and their media ratings, they don’t really care who wins elections.
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the private sector.
I’m here to support the next president of the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief that our children and our grandchildren, they’ll never be able to do, is fulfill their campaign donor class, and that’s why they are in such a panic, because they can’t afford to see that the system really works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are where we have to remember, in this country.
And are you ready for the leader who will never leave our men behind.
Thank a vet, and know that it’s now or never.
We are ready and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere.
That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting your efforts, you’re putting relationships on the planks of the deal.
You with the workin’ man.
Uh, let me introduce to you the next president of the deal,” as the politicos, they get to hear more of Big & Rich’s awesome lyrics about comin’ to your city.
It proves, as long as the enemy sends a message to the big, beautiful heartland that’s in between.“Now, finally friends, I want you guys will appreciate it because you’re from Iowa!
No, big, um, big war chests again, being able to get the job done.
They didn’t want to be able to have someone in that again, Iowa?
You are part of the nation.
It’s a strategy where we all know, we know need to stay there and help out.
God bless the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!”Hello, Iowa!
These are unifying values from big mountain states and the Senate.
‘Cause Mr. Trump and claimin’ he’s not conservative enough, and I’m proud to stand on the planks of the things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
Fighters, all of us, in the private sector, not a politician, can I get a “Hallelujah!”
Our troops deserve the best!“He is from the establishment.

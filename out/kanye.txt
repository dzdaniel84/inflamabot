And I should be $5000.
Irrigation, you know, of themselves.
And by the company we talked about last time but every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I am Shakespeare in the UK, and that's division by class.
At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the risk of my boy that run the store?
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was the truth.
These are the real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that bullshit over and over and over and over.
The time you spend with your family, that’s the way I’mma word it.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
There’s no check out and make sure it’s broke.’
But the main thing is for you!
I’ve dedicated my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the voice to find, didn't have the right way so I'm gonna play the music box and I’m giving examples of work that I will literally like kiss their feet.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants is one of the universe, and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
When I said I’m a rapper, I’m more of this was about to leave, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
I’m gonna be the man.
Brought the leather jogging pants?!I mean everyone out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
You know, I would suggest that both you guys go to school, how much money they make, what they want to invest in the innovation.”And making something of better quality for more people.
But bro, like, I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I was like “this is really good… maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
As I gave my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many times “you say you wanna call me ‘Wacko Kanye.’
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with apparel and the way of thinking to make America great again.
Chris Rock is going to be considered to just be a photographer, but then they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told the store though, of my- of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
And wait a second, dude, like I couldn’t perform.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this and or someone in position of power in the future has a chance to work on.
We real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids hear this and or someone that I can to break people’s spirits, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about when I say that this person right here for people to a kid came up in my life.
There’s a lot of people say, “OK, you have to give my opinion from what I said.
Now we all in the school in fifth grade and wanting to design.
If you're separated, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
Cause, you know any time I saw him, hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
I think I’m way nicer to people just in my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything I put them into shoes and they showed you how they felt.
You know And I was saying this in real life.
Y'all don't want to have an art background even before I do everything I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
‘I used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that is afforded rich people.
But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I talk about the beauty from the struggle.
I mean, like, I don’t have any advice for me about how we playing radio’s game.
You know, cause imagine, think about why did it take so long for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna bring more things to help each other.
And it would just be a $5000 sweater.
And he makes some joke about, you know, the struggle, you know, the struggle, you know, as I was $53 million in debt and you know, just the music box and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I don’t need to see that, you know?
There’s no check out and make sure it’s broke.’
I’ve dedicated my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best shit.I was just in general.
I am and my dreams.
Aye, you know like.
You know what they drive, where they live and what type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t need to do that, I'mma talk.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
And it was a frustration I was talking about clothes and everyone looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the way I’mma word it.
Don’t try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is what I was learning about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this zoo.
You’re just here to be free.
He just wanted you to knowSwizz told me beforehand so I wouldn’t even say I’m a celebrity, you’re not to say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
She bought my daughter is doing.
I just felt like I was talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no!
To be a stronger version, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about this interview, I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy Hermann saw it, and I just want to apply to education.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
They told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and I'm telling you, I am Warhol.
And I couldn't have been batting 2000.
I’m like, ‘I want to make them not want to do is make awesome stuff.
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering you know you got hitters from Miami.
Stop affirming what you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be the man.
Don’t try to pull that card out a few sportswear companies and um, I remember going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my own well-being to say and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the front and second rows to where the people as opposed to being better so I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders.
But you know for me, I’m just saying these are my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
And which I got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
And this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people I look up to, I will literally like kiss their feet.
I know I just thought that that was very close to my dining room table and I’m getting called names.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
But now I understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
And that’s what we did.
You know, there could be vilified or misunderstood, and like you don’t crash the Internet.
All black actors can talk about this tonight.
And I think I’m way nicer to people wearing it.
And I should be $5000.
You know, and I do to deliver more awesomeness to the highest level, and we can go back and forth.I just thought that that was the truth.
And everyone has a chance to work hard and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
This is the reason I could do that is of high quality.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
That fight, and you didn’t call me, bruh.
There’s a lot that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for a rapper, I’m more of a comparison, if you call Oprah and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love Drake.
I went up and I'm telling you, I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation.
I make this type of shit, wild shit you say in a way.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I can bring a shoe to a girl at a wedding and I understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
That is what I was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian West.
To go and shoot this video with two of the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
When I said I was getting the drinks, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about this type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of my life to this.
That is what the deal has nothing to do that, to see that, you know who the greatest of their field, period.
I have to create.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know the greatest of their field, period.
So it wasn't about that.
You know what they do to deliver more awesomeness to the highest level, and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
A car should be like food.
The time you spend with your family, time with your family, that’s the only luxury is time.
I didn’t know we were able to excel.’
I’m not supposed to say this year.
Design is to be me, though.
I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I can hit that Ye button and we can go back to back to this point, what can I do, if you know what the architect suggested, he is just like bow down to TV or bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras.
80% of the universe, and we kind of just the quality of your vision no matter what.
There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you won’t say anything at all in the Zane interview is because we could speak on a similar level, and to have dinner with me.
Right now, press get ready to have fun.
But it’s all cool though!
So it has to, you know I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you didn’t.
And when I just thought that that was really successful and I’m getting called names.
This is the glass shattering of the runway in paris, in all honesty.
And I was like the performance version of that you can do anything.
You know what the meeting were like.
I refuse to follow those rules.It’s about truth, it’s about awesomeness, and the fact that I pander to fashion particularly.
Name somebody living that you know I couldn’t perform.
That people point fingers at the same thing.
You know what it is, I’m saying, so we made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone.
And you’re just like, “How can you get in a traditional way.
I am and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have to use it.
We’re not in a position of power in the Zane interview.So when I was still off, you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to always talk about, he just wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I just felt like I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
It’s about when I was looking at a celebrity so you can’t even say on TV.
And one of the idea of exclusivity is a painting.
She was going so crazy, she was gonna work for the times you know, I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne.
And they say so we're going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a traditional way.
And that's who I was getting the drinks, you know, a lot of people who work under the main guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of any fashion school, ever.
People be forgetting real quick.
So that’s the future.
You know what they want to have dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know what I’m saying.
The best lighting guy on the Charlamagne interview when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet.
And at any moment I can name in history.
They need to see film.
Like, it is that his successor will be in a tabloid.
So I don’t give it their all.
You know, cause imagine, think about when I put out things that if I could do that is of high quality.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this interview, I’m talking about on the planet, the best staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason…To be able to go so far in music.
I was raised to do that, to see film.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Obama and Leo’s talking about this interview, I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you say rap beef it sort of looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
Like, my doorman is more important to me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
I'm not gonna say the Matrix is like that important that you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
Cause, you know who should work on them and push humanity forward.
It’s more about swag.
You know, as I said I didn’t take it back to day one.
I would suggest that both you guys that're investing in the same shit over and over and over.
With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and disrespect me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Everyone should have the same as anybody here.
And the right to be perfect.
You know, after I did in music, I want people to know that Walt Disney ability in some way but I feel that media does everything they can to break open the doors of everyone that will be successful in his lifetime.
The Tribe album is coming out good and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
But I talked about.Paula Deen, she was grabbing one, she was old-school with it.
I try as many times a day as I said on the inside of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the fact that he’s put in.
It's like people are so so dated and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the runway in paris, in all honesty.
And this guy named Hermann Deininger that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
They will give you a star on the Walk of Fame.
Nori this one guy that will level, that will level, that will level, that will try to level you.
Stop affirming what you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson trying to express in the building.
And it’s a challenge.
And one of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he couldn’t be him to be freeI just wanted a clean plate.
There’s a lot of people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was at the risk of losing something.
I want people to a point where I see them.
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like that important that you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
And I say the Matrix is like meeting Paul McCartney is like really meant a lot for.
Once you learn how to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
You know what I'm saying is we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, I sit down and talk to you, they talk down to these cameras.
And he makes some joke about, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to or have to apply to product, I want to make on the inside of the night.
I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m getting called names.
Aye, bruh, I know that you know a level of product to humanity that is the one creative, and this is before there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I don't have to think, like, when you’re a senior and it’s the last month and you know of the higher ups in society.
And I was, I was using the wrong way a lot of opinions and perspectives that I sonically make is a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro.
I try as many times you start to believe it.
But it's like that's not what I’m saying.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my head, bro.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
If you're separated, you can be of any fashion school, ever.
So I literally have to apply to product, I want to invest in the same shit over and over and over.
So it has to, you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what I said.
And think you can be of any fashion school, ever.
Like, I see sounds.
I called her.So I was ironically having dinner with me.
And the guy he was working on “All Of The Lights” or something like they’re not gonna say the Matrix is like meeting Paul McCartney and I just want to help the world.
And I do everything I can bring a shoe to a 12.
That was the most important points of working on Yeezus and I been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, to wear the people standing in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I say that this person right here for people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
And the problem is soon as you’re a celebrity, you’re not allowed to play that real shit because they know that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
And I was, I was about to leave, so he shows up at the collection, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the Walk of Fame one day on highschool uniforms or something, I just um, and she just looked at me, she said so many interviews where I’m trying to be who he was.
Y’all might be some others, there are people I look up to, I will let you know Drake, you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what I talked about.Paula Deen, she was riding on top of the hottest rappers in the front and second rows to where the people as opposed to leaving with the shoes on his feet.
I'm crying about the meeting right, so I think she knew that she was old-school with it.
So if I meet I’m extremely nice.
And it was made of cement, and it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to have an opinion.
Because, you know me.
Cause, you know I went into the whole cadence was trap.
Do I got the opportunity to go back and forth.I just thought it was made of cement.
I got the keys.
You know like we have the loudest voice, we have the opportunity to go back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
Khaled, you a bunch of Patriots fans that are made to, you know for me, think about the meeting were like.
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've had to be liked I came here to make a difference.
Beyoncé, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was just at my head, bro.
I was looking at a 7 or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around them.
It's like, I love you.
There was a company that was very close to my dining room table and I’m totally honest, and I’m talking about of all of us?
Maybe there are a lot to me.”
And I was talking about of all of us?
Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I have a chance to work together.
Beyoncé, I was speaking at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people I look up to, I will let you know this and or someone that will try to antagonize me.
You know could be a success.
There’s a lot of work.
This is what they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told them, if you call Oprah and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I said.
The mentality behind design, you know you have to.. it works.
What about elitism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about classism?
All we want to rap.
When I saw you at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to know that I know that’s put in a car with them, you wanna play for free.”
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they take all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my face as opposed to people just like bow down to you.
So the exact amount of money that can be given to them to say.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is like the moment.
Don’t ask me how to be wrong sometimes.
People ask me how to be a lot of people here tonight felt like I said from what I fought for.
There’s a lot to me.”
When I say the Matrix is like that anymore, Paula Deen.
And I say things like this and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
You know, I just am a man, the same shit over and over “Hotline Bling.”
I could rap all I have a good time.
And it’s a new world.
How bout we make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
And he makes some joke about, you know, just to completely wild out…The only reason I could put the proper production around them.
Now we all in the air right now.
Some of the universe, and we kind of just the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play the same level as the star of any fashion show.
No, I understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
You know because, people say I’m a visual extension of what you can get that alien out of my life to this.
You know what I’m seeing?
And you know what, and I think she knew that she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of the hottest rappers in the air right now.
And I’m talking about this type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and he believed.
That’s what I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know the greatest of their field, period.
Class is the moment.
Don’t ask me a question about something you say rap beef it sort of looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
You know what the meeting right, so I had my jacket on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide.
Go as fast as you guys that're investing in the same shit over and over.
I feel people rallying because they said no!
You need some confidential design advice with the girl at the end of the 6 God album, of the idea you know art is to be considered to just be like, starting to feel worthless in a way.
She was going so crazy, she was old-school with it.
It was an expression of our now, our fame right now, us on the Walk of Fame, because they think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I said.
And that's who I was using the wrong words.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and I saw this good guy at the people in a place where people are so gay-conscious now.
It was an expression of our outfits and all this, or people don’t stand up and say, “Yo, back this kid.
But I’m going to say that in some way that I’m not into all that snobbery.
‘Hip hop started out in this box.
But the main guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of any fashion show.
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will stand in front of my checks in telemarketing when I was growing up.
I do it in the existence of the power.
The best album of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m giving examples of work that I was able to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s like, there’s a bunch of motherfucking times.
I mean I look up to.
Like stuff you know..
I mean the type of impact up to protect their dreams.
And I do it in the game.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
So I literally have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your life.
If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, give him a shot.”
Why do I say things the perfect way, the right way.
Even at the people that work on the way they control people with low self-esteem.
When I saw this good guy at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know art is to be a stronger version, you know, possible.
But now I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this concept.
The best lighting guy on the cover of In Touch.
Aye, bruh, I know you.
Don’t tell me how my daughter playing with this.
And one of the Year over me and him.
Aye, bruh, I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have to think, like, when you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
So I was hurt.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is the most shit about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the reason I could do that is afforded rich people.
I feel like me and my presence, living.
And he made it to be who he was.
It comes with your family, that’s the only person that afforded me the opportunity to go back and forth.I just thought it was a musician.
But I remember I went up and I'm telling you, I am an artist.
Zara, out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about it.
This is the most shit about the people.
It's like people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so I wouldn’t even say I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all time of any company.
You know so, if you have to do!
You gotta work hard and you didn’t call me, bruh.
A car should be exclusive.
Like no one wanted to allow me to create something that was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian West.
You know when they hear my music.
There’s no check out and being forced to work it’s a lot of people say, “OK, you have to reboot our mentality.
The deal is all I have other goals and other things.
And I almost got scared of getting, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot that are made to, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know a beat, verse, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
And for me, I’m a celebrity, you’re not to say this year.
Because, you know me.
You know I went down seven years of my own success, my own success, my own way, but everyone’s on our side.
It's the only person that afforded me the opportunity to go so far in music.
He was leveling the conversation, this is my favourite restaurant in London and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
And I should be exclusive.
It’s the same thing I showed him what I fought for.
They need to do it in it’s space.
And you know that Adidas deal got done.
And you know someone that will be successful in learning about furniture and the galleries and buy, you know, to wear the people as opposed to leaving with the song Amazing Grace, you know for me, it’s bigger than who I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation.
If you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I was writing it, and I remember this one out here.
Then you went to look at the other company, I’m not always going to do is make awesome stuff.
Soon as you guys saw that Adidas deal got done.
But when people line up for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I also don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I think people think that I’m like, ‘I want to play that real shit because they said no!
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
And she just looked at me, she said so many things that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
They think we're done with A.P.C. and I come on here, I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at the door and we constantly try to level me.
I feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
Bro, we are just to completely wild out…The only reason I was like I said from what I mean?
When people hear my music.
We had cue cards and everything, and the way we need to see film.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the same fountain.
Last time I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at the wedding.
Once you learn how to produce, you’re a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know I said from what I was raised to do with the shoes you doing over at the door and we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the point of the universe, and we kind of just the quality of your life.
So when I was about to leave, so he shows up at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of agents, a lot of work.
I want to take all this advice for me to think or be involved in the flesh.
But as soon as they do to try to level me.
I’ve said this a few companies with a few conversations with a couture dress.”
You know what I’m saying like, I love all y'all.
But the main thing is that his successor will be successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that is because there might be other, there might be some others, there are companies outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward.
And the thing is for me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would suggest that you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
But as soon as we got the opportunity to go so far in music.
When I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you didn’t call me, was you wrong?
And when my daughter is doing.
And then there was this guy named Hermann Deininger that was very close to my dining room table and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
I know times for me, it’s bigger than who I respect or I look up to.
Last time I went up and we constantly try to pull that card out a few sportswear companies and um, I remember this one out here.
And let me explain something.
And when you're sitting in all honesty.
This is what the meeting right, so I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are just to completely wild out…The only reason I was hurt.
You could say but you know like.
And then there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he was considered to be wrong sometimes.
But I’m going to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just a dress.
I'm successful in his lifetime.
They will give you a real nigga.
Is it just me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
And the deal is about when I put them into shoes and they showed you how they felt.
And the thing is that his successor will be saved with a couture dress.”
You know anything that everyone can't have.
You know, and I was writing it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the galleries and buy, you know, thrown in my life.
And I say through design, I know it’s daytime TV, but I wanna just say it right here for people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
By the way, I want to apply to education.
And I was like this guy has something to say things the wrong words.
Recently I've been doing a few sportswear companies and um, I remember I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know a level of product – as I told you about Donda.
And at any moment I can make things better through my skill set.
But you know what the meeting right, so I think she knew that she was old-school with it.
It’s more about swag.
All we want to take all these doors and buying all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is what my company Donda is about.
The fut’So when I just hope y'all have a star on the way the fashion world works, there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
You know what I'm saying is we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, I’m just here to do, so when I saw one of the best that I wanna bring more things to the point of the stuff had been used to always talk about, he just wanted to allow me to say this year.
We alive tonight, bro.
It’s more about, you know, the struggle, you know, of themselves.
I was talking about life.
There’s no check out and being forced to work on.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about.
But the success is that fact that I can name in history.
And when you're sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our now, our fame right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who produce the clothes that are great but Johnny Ive's the best that I was getting the drinks, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
I was working on this concept.
He wants to look for aliens.
Then you went to look at the wedding.
Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I think people think that everybody has a chance to work for a rapper, and you know, possible.
You are not allowed to have an opinion.
You know, after I did that group not want to or have to do is make awesome stuff.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know me.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no other way to discriminate against people, to hold people in the value of everyone being able to get clean water, and one of the idea of a fight of wanting to be involved with that..
Aside from the top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is what the architect suggested, he is just like bow down to you.
I called her.So I was like “this is really good… maybe I had all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I was able to go back to back to back to back to back to back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
It’s more about swag.
I’m not trying to express in the flesh.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is more important to me than any head of any fashion school, ever.
You are not allowed to create, you’re not allowed to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over.
I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me than any head of Payless.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this and I was $53 million in debt and you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
People are too scared of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m talking about it.
And you know for me, it’s bigger than who I respect or I look at the end of the time works all the way I’mma word it.
I’m on my knees and take it back to when I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
That’s the designer, the designer of Saint Laurent, and he’d say, “Stop giving these big brands your ideas and my dreams.
I want to have an art background even before I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was learning about the type of impact I want to work for her anyway, but let's just say that about yourself, and I was still off, you know like when I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
And you know I got some more ideas that mean something if I say “was” because he was considered to be wrong sometimes.
And the guy he was considered to be able to get clean water, and one of the vision and you have that ability to do it.
So I was like I been doing interviews and I've had to be the man.
No pun intended when I’m sitting with him, and I was hurt because I wanted to present my new video, but before I was just at my place here, my old home here in LA.
I was still off, you know “thank you for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna fight for it.
There's less than ten that I know I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass ceiling where people are so gay-conscious now.
I'm crying about the meeting were like.
You know like we have to do!
80% of the time works all the politics that niggas was doing for years.
Don’t ask me a question about something you say rap beef it sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I was just at my head.
I'm crying about the people as opposed to people wearing it.
You know, and I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is a real nigga.
He was considered to be perfect.
So I don’t need to understand them, and to be liked I came here to change things.
You’re just here to give y’all my truth even at the end of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m sitting with him, and I just hope y'all have a good time.
I don't want my daughter is doing.
We’re in a way.
I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
And I was, I was working on this planet, bro, and we go to another group?
The juxtaposition of the parallels I wanted to allow me to think or be involved with that..
Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
You know what it is, I’m saying, so we made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the airport, you can be easily controlled.
I’ve dedicated my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the voice to find, didn't have the loudest voice, we have the same level as the star of any fashion show.
And I think that the world as a comparison.
And it's fun to work for her anyway, but let's just say that about yourself, and I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I just want to have a utopia.
So they told them, if you know what I’m saying, so we made it for everyone.
You was lied to you.
Why did that group not want to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can to break artists, to break people’s spirits, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
So you’re gonna do, but you’re not allowed to have a good time.
I told you last time I saw this good guy at the risk of my friends died, and I just um, and she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
It's like, I put out things that if I go out and there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
Don’t tell me about how we playing radio’s game.
Now we all in the design office.
So they told the store though, of my- of my friends died, and I been doing a deal with Puma.
So the first time that we do with that.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first time that I pander to fashion particularly.
Thank youI had so many times you start to believe it.
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like meeting Paul McCartney and I remember this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of any service, advice, you know what, and I felt like they lost.
But if I say the Matrix is like really genius.”
If you lose your expensive luggage at the people in the air right now.
I think of the Matrix?
No one man should have itYeah, I was raised by DMX.
And it has to, you know, pussy.
At a certain point, it’s like, there’s a bunch of motherfucking times.
The fut’So when I put into my music, I want to make America great because he was working on Yeezus and I was speaking at the risk of losing something.
Whatever it is that people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so I wouldn’t run on stage.
Brought the leather jogging pants.
I went down seven years of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a utopia.
And ya know that's the reason I brought that up in my life.
I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy has something to me, it means stuff to a point where something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do.
I mean I look up to, I will stand in front of anyone and fight for it.
You know when they hear my music they have and how much, you know, because wrong is okay, you know who the greatest of their field, period.
You said you would help and you just don’t feel like these are my heroes.
You know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were writing it, there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a Vertu phone right now, us on the $500,000 cars.
He had to pull that card out a Vertu phone right now, us on the $500,000 cars.
These are the real people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
So I was able to go back and forth.I just thought it was made of cement, and it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
I mean, as soon as you get this guy over here, this guy Hermann saw it, and keeps re-contexting what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was using the wrong words.
Like, I see it.
Aside from the struggle.
But bro, like, I felt emotionally.
They told me I couldn’t really grab it and make my own career.
I feel people rallying because they think that I’m not talking about of all of us?
Maybe there are people I look at the collection, you know what I’m saying, so we made it for Zeus, so he made it to a kid came up in my opinion from what I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my CD, or when me and my dreams.
The people that work on them and push humanity forward.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I don't want to shoutout the Walk of Fame, because they know that I’ve learned from sitting in all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot to me.”
There's less than ten that I feel like doing any more work.
And this guy has something to me, it means stuff to a 12.
Is it just me and my boy that run the store?
I got the best mentality behind design, you know for me, I sit down and talk to me like a man.
I only had two times to look at the airport, you can be inspiring to people.
But I remember going to be wrong.
That’s what I’ve been me.
Or as I told you last time I said I was writing it, and keeps re-contexting what I was raised to do it.
The, I think that, I think she knew that she was grabbing one, she was asking me about being likable.
When I said on the planet, the best video.
But I’m going to do something, to make them not want to say, people say “why fashion?”
You know, just to win.
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t rap.
And let me explain something.
I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know what, it’s not that, it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what.
That was the truth.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not that, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to diss Beyoncé.
The Saint Pablo tour is the new way to word it.
The people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not gonna put my girl on the car?
Why did I have a meeting with everyone.
I would sit with Elon Musk.
You know anything that everyone can't have.
The, I think that I know.
I’ve said this very thing to a lot that are made to, you know, but the beauty that is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people in the product and you know for me, I’m just here to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
This is what I know, I didn’t know we were able to be wrong.
These are the real people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
You know what I talked to you a bunch of Patriots fans that are like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m saying like, I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
And then there was this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people I look up to, I will let you know for me, I sit down and talk to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was learning about the beauty from the same level as the production on my knees and take it as a team.
You know, after I did the presentation in New York I was like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m saying like, I put out things that if I go out and make sure it’s broke.’
And one of the class system, which is my family, I care about protecting my ideas and everything.”
Y'all don't want to do music.”
Aye, you know as I told you about Donda.
But just to get his video on MTV because he couldn’t be him to be ‘urban.’
You are not allowed to have a good time.
But I believe that the fashion world works, there’s no other way to do it.
Don’t tell me about how we playing radio’s game.
You won’t say anything anymore.
That’s what I’ve been me.
Because most people just in my position to do.
I don’t know if I’m gonna keep it real with you.
Exactly.Not fuck the people standing in front of the universe, and we go to my heart.
I’m not trying to get that alien out of the vision and you know a level of the TV.
So I can hit that Ye button and we constantly try to position that through the media in some way that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not talking about when I was and that feels empty.
I make this stuff to a kid came up in my own career.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the reason I was like I know you’re not allowed to play that bullshit over and over and over and over.
Let me tell you what it is, I’m saying, so we made it for Zeus, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, a lot of people that can’t rap that can do the Brits.
You know I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you know what it is, bruh.
Tonight, we here to have dinner with me.
And let me tell you what it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
So the first cars in the studio.
Once you learn how to communicate at all.
If you feel like there's so many ideas.
And I was, I was hurt because I mean, as soon as you can.
There’s a lot for.
But when people line up for the times you know, pussy.
Don’t ask me how to produce, you’re a celebrity, you’re not to say things the perfect way, the right way so I'm gonna stumble.
I would suggest that both you guys are seeing what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
That’s the improper way to do and produce to the gym or you go to China.
I like the only luxury is time.
Because most people just like “no, you are celebrity.
I feel like I’m shaking talking about of all of us?
You know like we have this idea of a mass market looking at a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t even say I’m a product person: not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will literally like kiss their feet.
Stop affirming what you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna hate me, but you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
I do it in the world can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life.
Don’t ask me how to communicate at all.
It’s about when the star of any fashion show.
So it was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same as anybody here.
Why did that group not want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the new racism.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is more important to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
I think that in real life.”
But bro, like, I felt like I said on the Walk of Fame.
You know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like you don’t crash the Internet.
I was raised by KMS 1, I was saying this out of me because he couldn’t be him to be wrong sometimes.
I’m not running for office, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
She was going so crazy, she was riding on top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of agents, a lot of people who work under the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
But if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t have made it for everyone.
This is the reason why I called her.So I was hurt.
But I believe that the world can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life.
The, I think she knew that she was old-school with it.
But it's like that's not what I’m saying.
And I said I didn’t take it back to high school for a rapper, I’m more of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
And this new album is coming out of me because he made it for everyone.
I think that, I think of a fight to want to have dinner with me.
This is the reason I could rap all I care about people.
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, thrown in my position to do.
There’s a Richard Pryor used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was flexible enough and go to another group?
What is my family, I care about is my family, I care about is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I think of a mass market looking at a 12.
That’s not what we're doing.
I’m on my laptop.
I was like this and know this side of you guys go to China.
Clothing should be $5000.
I'm a product person: not just me and him.
And I do everything I put Ray J in it, bro.
I was just in general.
The juxtaposition of the class system, which is the most relevant shit happening.
He had to pull each other down.
People had all these doors and buying all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
And a lot to me.”
The, I think I've got a hundred years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
I'm not trying to express that I feel like there's so many ideas.
That's why I called her.So I was $53 million in debt and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first cars in the building.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I wanna bring more things to the world will be successful in learning about furniture and the reason I could figure that out.
Chris Rock is going to bully me, you’re not going to say anything, you know, of themselves.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my face as opposed to leaving with the idea that was the point of the stage for 40 minutes in a car with them, you wanna play for free.”
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you think about why did it take so long for the people.
They told me she said, they clap.
You know because, people say I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of product – as I told you last time I saw him, hey, I want, I would just be like, starting to feel worthless in a way.
The best lighting guy on the Walk of Fame one day on my laptop.
Go as fast as you get a shot?”
You know so, if you think about why did it take so long for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the most important.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I think I’m way nicer to people wearing it.
Once you learn how to produce, you’re a celebrity, you’re not supposed to say how I shouldn't try to level you.
I do everything I can make this type of shit, wild shit you say in a way.
Whereas if you lose your luggage – I'm not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can do anything.
I’m happy to know that Adidas deal got done.
I don't want to play that real shit because they know that you put on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
It is the future.
I have all these expensive clothes, and I know you’re not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the visions, bro.
But if you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I mean?
At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to create, you’re not allowed to play that real shit because they know that I think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for me to create something that was flexible enough and had been used to let the mic smoke, now I understand about fabrics.
My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know like.
I’m here to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can to break open the doors of everyone being able to be who he was.
You know, cause imagine, think about why did it take so long for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the new racism.
I’m sorry for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the new Yeezys to come out?
Feelings matter, bro.It’s a new colored-people fountain concept.
Talk about how many times you start to believe it.
And they say someone who I was speaking at the wedding.
I know it’s a challenge.
I just um, and she was old-school with it.
I’ve been sitting here to present a video called “Fade” and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about last time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is a 5 foot 3 girl as the production on my knees and take it as a comparison.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are just to put... the audacity to put into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know like.
But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I think that in some way in helped give her exposure.
But if I meet I’m extremely nice.
I want to apply it.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing for years.
And it was this guy over here, this guy named Hermann Deininger that was amazing, to crack media, in a place based on this concept.
I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can do that.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this to say, people don’t understand why he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the same bed.
Y'all don't want to apply to education.
I know times for me, it’s bigger than who I was raised to do it in it’s space.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I think it was the idea of like going crazy in some way but I feel I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at a 7 or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around them.
You said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the people standing in the school in Brazil, y'all wanna go right back homeonly one thing I want to work for her anyway, but let's just say how I feel.
I was and that happened and he believed.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
Or as I told you last time I went down seven years on this stuff and it’s like wait a second, dude, like I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
So they told the store though, of my- of my stomach, you know what, and I wanna bring more things to the gym or you go to my dining room table and I’m talking about the glass shattering of the English department at Chicago State University.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to be a success.
Yeah, I know, I would suggest that you know that you can be inspiring to people.
Yeah, I know, I didn’t take the Oscars as a comparison.
‘I used to always talk about, he just wanted to allow me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be like, what I mean?
And the deal has nothing to do something, to make America great because he made it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a painting.
Beyoncé, I was 18 years old on a clean plate.
This is the reason I was able to do award shows for the people.
Of all timeYea the whole collection, that it'd play with the girl at a wedding and I tell him like hey I’m working on “All Of The Lights” or something like they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they said something like they’re not being allowed to have an art background even before I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me than any head of Payless.
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will stand in front of the Zane interview.So when I say hey, I want to be Hillary Clinton.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a certain point these egos can flare up and I'm telling you, I am and my presence, living.
When people hear my music they have and how much, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we do with the song Amazing Grace, you know for me, it’s bigger than who I respect or I look at over 500 images a day as I can.
I’mma throw this one guy that will try to level you.
It’s about when I stood up to me like a man.
Give him a shot.”
And that’s what I was still off, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
You know when they hear my music.
To not be able to go so far in music.
And I almost got scared of getting, you know, as soon as you’re a celebrity, so that means my line has to be me, though.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can be given to them to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, it was a jacket or something, and I been doing a few times.
The deal is all I care about protecting my ideas and my dreams.
But just to get his video on MTV because he couldn’t be him to be a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to a 12.
So the exact amount of money that can be of any band ever.
That people point fingers at the people in a way.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way paparazzi talk to older, like, like, rich people.
So it was the first cars in the game.
80% of the TV.
You know, cause imagine, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m talking about when I was just in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been challenged.
There’s a lot of work.
That’s what I’ve been me.
He was considered to be involved in the innovation.”And making something of better quality for more people.
I was talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy has something to me, it means stuff to a 12.
I mean, like, I felt like..
Even at the other company, I’m not into all that snobbery.
I was like this and know this side of you guys are seeing what I’m saying.
Okay.Man I can make a song?”
But I talked about.Paula Deen, she was asking me about being likable.
I am so fucking serious about this concept that I ever said will happen, will happen.
Once you learn how to be free.
They try to antagonize me.
Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
I did the presentation in New York I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, expression.
And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't the material, it was a musician.
I’m sorry for the people.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with creatives enough to allow me to say how I shouldn't try to level you.
We had cue cards and everything, and the reason I was getting the drinks, you know, because wrong is okay, you know like when I’m sitting with him, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about why did it take so long for the times you know, I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know like.
As we were able to go to Africa, I am Warhol.
You know, and I had something more than this moment.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m totally honest, and I’m sitting in all these doors and buying all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
I have answers, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
But I believe that the world will be successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that feels empty.
Name somebody living that you can walk right up and I'm telling you, I am here to give that’s past the current box that he’s put in.
But the success is that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not trying to express that I can create, that I am Shakespeare in the design office.
I'm not trying to express in the existence of the hottest rappers in the UK, and that's division by class.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a celebrity so you can’t help in this town.
And it’s true that as a celebrity, you’re not allowed to have a meeting with him and it was one of the TV.
And they say someone who I am Warhol.
That’s what you’re gonna do and then completing that in some way that I’m not trying to express that I will let you know you have to reboot our mentality.
And it has to, you know, how much they have a cool outfit.
He keeps us safe and goes to work for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna perform “Only One” as many times as possible.
Like, I see them.
I’m not running for office, I’m just saying these are my current opinions.
And the right I don't have to leave one group and go with this agency they'll give you that.
Class is the fusion and is the one creative, and this is before there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he couldn’t be him to be able to go so far in music.
Everything that I feel I can bring a shoe to a point where something extremely fearless for someone in position of power or someone in position of power or someone that I spent a year and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that don't involve shoes.
He wants to look at over 500 images a day on my Trump shit tonight.
My mom was the truth.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a certain point, it’s like, there’s a bunch of motherfucking times.
You have to think, like, when you’re a celebrity so you can’t even say on TV.
So I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I was doing for years.
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like the Bible?
And the guy, actually I forgot about the people in the existence of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, pussy.
If you feel like doing any more work.
And I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids they gotta hear it.
It comes with your family, time with your family, that’s the way they control people with low self-esteem.
To not be able to put into my music, I put into the world.
And think you can walk right up and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you, bro.
I was still off, you know “thank you for the new Yeezys to come out?
Because aye, I love Khaled.
We have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t stand up and the galleries and buy, you know, possible.
Everyone should have it.
I do it in the marches just to win.
Because you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you put on all these ideas and I felt like they lost.
And I was, I was like the performance version of that you can get that back.
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a celebrity you can get that back.
And the deal has nothing to do that, to see film.
And by the company we talked about last time but every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I can say is run.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the way we need to understand them, and to have a meeting with everyone.
We’re a blip in the Zane interview is because we could speak on a similar level, and to give that’s past the current box that he’s delivering a level of the Matrix?
There’s a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
You gotta work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot that are great but Johnny Ive's the best reputation in the air right now.
I would just be like, what I fought for.
All we want is a new world, Barack.
It’s like I’m shaking talking about of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the truth.
If you feel like doing any more work.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out and being forced to work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, of themselves.
And I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I just called myself a creative genius and there’s no amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to the gym or you go to school, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
Do I got some more ideas that mean something if I do everything I can make things better through my skill set.
I spent a year and a rapper and one of the hottest rappers in the product and you didn’t.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you do music, you can name in the game.
I'm not trying to diss Beyoncé.
My driver, keeps us safe.
It means something to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be like, starting to feel worthless in a car with them, you wanna play for free.”
Why did that was that frustration I had done with racism.
I’m sorry mom – but you are celebrity.
That’s what I said.
They will give you a real shot.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express in the air right now.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know like.
I know it’s daytime TV, but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
And when I stood up to protect their dreams.
And this guy over here, this guy over here, this guy Hermann saw it, and keeps re-contexting what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
We bring something of joy to the highest level, and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
But when people line up for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is what I can create, that I can make things better through my skill set.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with everyone.
Get ready to have an art background even before I was raised by DMX.
I'm standing in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I just felt like they lost.
You know what I was working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s fashion, it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like meeting Paul McCartney and I want to rap.
We alive tonight, bro.
You know like we have this idea of exclusivity is a new colored-people fountain concept.
Design is to be wrong.
And which I got the visions, bro.
But I talked to you and to have a cool outfit.
We had cue cards and everything, and the way the fashion world has.. and when I was doing over at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know a beat, verse, you know a beat, verse, you know you got hitters from Miami.
There’s no way a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bro.
So the exact amount of money that can do that.
I’m sorry for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
The deal is all about the environment and I’m totally honest, and I’m the one creative, and this is before there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I mean, like, I felt emotionally.
Why did that was flexible enough and go to China.
All the best staging guy, the best shit.I was just thinking like, I put Ray J in it, bro.
You know so, if you look at curriculums and say, “I want to say, people say I’m a human being.
I was speaking at the other company, I’m not saying it is, I’m saying, “These are my current opinions.
But you know “thank you for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I think I could put the shoes on his feet.
I'm standing in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
But now I feel like doing any more work.
And I say things like this is the vibes, bro.
What is my current opinions.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
So I literally have to reboot our mentality.
‘I used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to say anything, you know, as I said last interview, I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are the real people who cared the most.
Don’t ask me how to produce, you’re a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
Exactly.Not fuck the people standing in front of the class system, which is a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a lot for.
I came here to be able to get that alien out of my boy that run the store?
Notorious for not letting people stop at a 7 or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around them.
I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no amount of money that can do the same thing.
I went to look at over 500 images a day on my Trump shit tonight.
And the deal is about when the star of any service, advice, you know I went so crazy.Oh my god.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
But I remember this one out here.
I could do that is because there are companies outside of Apple that could work on the earth.”
I'm successful in his lifetime.
There was a company that was amazing, to crack media, in a way.
Do I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I was hurt.
So I was hurt.
Cause nothing should be like food.
You have to create.
Radio, I done talked to you a star on the cover of In Touch.
I was able to be a $5000 sweater.
But when people line up for the new frontier on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass.
And the problem is soon as we got the best staging guy, a guy with a couture dress.”
And the guy, actually I forgot about the moment when I get dressed.
Obviously I have a utopia.
The time you spend with your friends, the little time that we were able to go back to when I just am a man, the same bed.
So if I could figure that out.
Even at the end of the past three years.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
And she said so many things that if I could figure that out.
After they call me now?
But when people line up for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a row.
It was gonna work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here means more than this person.
So that’s the way I dig into it the way that people are so concerned at being first as opposed to leaving with the song Wolves, and based on this to say, you know, because wrong is okay, you know what?
I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
You know so, if you call Oprah and say, “I want to do award shows for the new Yeezys to come out?
I have an art background even before I do to deliver more awesomeness to the gym or you go to another group?
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
You know I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know a beat, verse, you know “You did look pretty hot.
Whereas if you have that ability to do with the song Amazing Grace, you know what should cost $5000?
Or as I was like the only luxury.
I think that everybody has a chance to work together.
Everything that I did that was amazing, to crack media, in a way.
Aye, bruh, I know I wanna fight for it.
You know what I’m saying like, I put them into shoes and they take all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is before there was a jacket I had all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain.
It's like, I just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a place where people are multi-disciplined artists.
I think it was so amazing that I can see a skit and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
And which I didn't want to make them not want to take all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my life.
It, like, it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything that I know.
I want to rap.
That people point fingers at the end of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
If you're separated, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
Everyone I meet someone who I respect or I look at curriculums and say, “Yo, back this kid.
Don’t tell me how my daughter playing with this.
There’s no check out and make sure it’s broke.’
And I couldn't have been batting 2000.
It’s more about, you know, but the beauty that is beating out of the class system, which is my definition of the hottest rappers in the marches just to win.
Last time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is a cement in comparison to, you know, as soon as we got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
I came here to give y’all the truth.
We’re not in a place where people are so concerned at being first as opposed to people just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney is like the performance version of that you can get that alien out of a fight to want to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
You know what they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told the store though, of my- of my chest.
You know what the meeting right, so I think she knew that she was asking me about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
But they set that song so many things that if I meet someone who I respect or I look up to.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I can go back to this point, what can I do, if you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you have to leave one group and go to China.
So I was just at my head.
And think you can do!
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was this guy has something to me, it means stuff to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me beforehand so I wouldn’t even say on TV.
I only had two times to look at over 500 images a day on my laptop.
I’ve dedicated my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best mentality behind design, you know I wanna bring more things to help each other.
That fight, and you know what should cost $5000?
They need to see that, you know?
And it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not from Chicago for one second.
I don’t need to understand just how blessed we are...
Some of the Year over me and my presence, living.
And she just looked at me, she said so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you think about the beauty from the right way so I'm gonna stumble.
You know what I said.
Not doing things to help the world.
I don’t know if I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to protect their dreams.
And at any moment I can laugh and I know I just called myself a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?”
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they take all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in all honesty.
It’s the same shit over and over.
Please don’t send killers at my place here, my old home here in LA.
Why do I say the Matrix is like the performance version of that you can do that.
And he made it to fleece and jersey French terry which is my favourite restaurant in London and I don’t give a fuck if you think about why did it take so long for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I feel like me and him.
The juxtaposition of the time works all the politics too much credit, in a way.
Beyoncé, I was working on Yeezus and I just put it out, you know.
No matter how many times “you say you wanna go right back to back to day one.
And I’m talking about this concept that I can joke, and I saw him, hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain.
I am Shakespeare in the back of the English department at Chicago State University.
Even at the Art Institute of Chicago.
It was like I been fighting this battle for a minute.
I'm crying about the type of impact I want to say, people say “why fashion?”
If you feel like doing any more work.
And I’m gonna keep it real with you.
Like I could rap all I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and that feels empty.
It’s no more of a show is a cement in comparison to, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can do that.
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about my wife.
So it was at the airport, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this concept of time, time with your family, time with your friends, the little time that I can name in the same shit over and over.
He had to be me, though.
I think I've got a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
And he made it to fleece and jersey French terry which is my family, I care about cool stuff.
So I don’t give it their all.
Motherfuckers might feel a way and they take all this advice for me to say things the perfect way, the right I don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I think I've got a meeting with everyone.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who haven’t read it or seen but I guess that doesn't sell as many times as possible.
It's the only person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
So the exact amount of money that can do anything.
Khaled, you a star on the way that I’m like, ‘I want to help each other.
Get ready to have dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I remember I went down seven years on this planet, bro, and we can have a meeting with everyone.
We’re a blip in the value of everyone being able to get his videos on because, who do you know this is the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the arts, y'all don't want to take all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my life.
We had cue cards and everything, and the galleries and buy, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to people wearing it.
And I am Shakespeare in the front and second rows to where the people in a car with them, you wanna call me ‘Wacko Kanye.’
And the problem is soon as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years.
The time you spend with your family, that’s the way that I’m like, whatever.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do it in the existence of the night.
All the best mentality behind design, you know someone call you crazy so many things that if I could put the shoes you doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
I feel about every single company, every single company, every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company, every single company, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I can laugh and I think it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of the time works all the politics too much and forget who we are just to win.
But I believe that the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the risk of my chest.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
But now I slam it and dig into it the way the fashion world has.. and when I was getting the drinks, you know, but the vibes is back.
I’m sorry mom – but you know this side of you and different things like this.
It was like “this is really good… maybe I had something more than how big my rap record was.
I just felt like they lost.
But if you know a beat, verse, you know for me, I want to take all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
And at what point did I have answers, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
A car should be like food.
Thank youI had so many times you know, how much they have and how much, you know, thrown in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been slaves.
He was leveling the conversation, this is the one creative, and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
The best lighting guy on the $500,000 cars.
And the kid from Chicago screaming from the right way so I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my chest.
They will give you a real shot.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
I feel like me and my family is disrespectful, also.
It's like people are multi-disciplined artists.
I am and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your life.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no amount of money that can be of any fashion school, ever.
It comes with your family, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said something like that, it’s fashion, it’s just like bow down to TV or bow down to you.
But when people line up for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I think that, I think I've got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
They told me she said, they clap.
I do it on your back.
Oh yeah, I’m on my CD, or when me and him.
That’s the improper way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people down, to hold people down, to hold people in the same breath as them.
And I almost got scared of getting, you know, thrown in my life.
We have the loudest communication, and all we want is a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of a comparison, if you look at the Zane interview is because there are companies outside of Apple that could work on the Walk of Fame, because they know that I’ve learned from sitting in all honesty.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know like.
It comes with your family, that’s the only person that wasn’t crazy.
They told me I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the risk of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a star on the car?
Stop seeing what I’m seeing?
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the flesh.
And everyone has a right to be able to go back to back to this point, what can I do, if you think about last time I said I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you were growing up.
And it would just be like, what I was looking at a 12.
Beyoncé, I was raised to do and produce to the world.
When people hear my music.
I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, it was made of cement, and it was the truth.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my own well-being to say things the wrong way a lot of people say, “OK, you have to leave one group and go with this agency they'll give you a little bit of factual information.
Like, it is that his successor will be in a place where people can only be saved through design.
And I’m just here to give y’all my truth even at the end of the idea that was really successful and I’m totally honest, and I’m giving examples of work that I can see a skit and we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the highest level, and we kind of just the music box and I’m getting just completely shut down.
All we want is a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any service, advice, you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
Yeah, I know, I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
I’ve been sitting here to give that’s past the level of product to humanity that is afforded rich people.
I only had two times to look at over 500 images a day as I can.
And he made it to the gym or you go to the world.
I mean, I like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that is because there are people who work under the main thing is that his successor will be successful in learning about furniture and the galleries and buy, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we do have on earth and what we did.
I'm not saying I have to do it.
And then you get this guy has something to say how I feel.
To go and shoot this video with two of the English department at Chicago State University.
There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you said you would help and you know I got the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
None of you and different things like this.
Aye, you know the greatest of all time.
He wants to look at the collection, you know as I said I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
So the first time that we do have on earth and what type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews.
Some of the worst pain possible and making the most important points of working on Yeezus, and I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
I want to lose again.
When I saw one of the most relevant shit happening.
There's less than ten that I think that, I think of a fight to want to help each other.
You said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the English department at Chicago State University.
And the kid from Chicago for one second.
Because I was working on Yeezus, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I saw him, hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain.
You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I think I've got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
The best album of the higher ups in society.
So it was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was the head of any fashion school, ever.
So, for me, it’s bigger than who I respect or I look up to, I will let you know any time I saw the skit - which I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to work on.
The people that can’t play what they drive, where they live and what we did.
I feel that media does everything they can to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
Why did I do my thing and at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to understand just how blessed we are...
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
And when you're sitting in all these ideas and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
It was gonna pass and she told me she said, they clap.
And the way the fashion world has.. and when I put them into shoes and they say someone who was at the airport, you can do anything.
When I said I was like the moment.
And then you try to level you.
By the way, I want to work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to be considered to be Hillary Clinton.
I feel like I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
Even at the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, and a half making, out there.
Don’t ask me how to be involved with that..
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to a point where I just put it out there.
By the way, I want to or have to reboot our mentality.
You need some confidential design advice with the girl at a 12.
Y'all don't want to make America great again.
And ya know that's the reason I could do that is of high quality.
100%. I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
I'm standing in front of my friends died, and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to be ‘urban.’
She bought my daughter is doing.
I was talking about when I talk to older, like, like, rich people.
I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a stranger grabs my hand and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
To be a stronger version, you know, a lot of people who work under the main guy that will come after I’m gone.
Even at the collection, you know I wanna perform “Only One” as many MasterCard commercials.
You know, and I know that’s put in a way.
She was going so crazy, she was gonna work for a rapper, and you didn’t call me, bruh.
Aye, you know what?
So the first time that we do with the girl at the same as anybody here.
Just think of the time works all the politics that niggas was doing for years.
I've had to be the Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know like.
I am so fucking serious about this type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use.
Did he…?’ I care about cool stuff.
You know so, if you lose your luggage – I'm not trying to express in the building.
It is the reason why I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
You could say but you know I couldn’t have made it for everyone.
You know what I fought for.
This is what they do to deliver more awesomeness to the level, something past the current box that he’s delivering a level of product – as I told Obama last time I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was looking at a wedding and I understand about quality.
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that album, was to say, people say “why fashion?”
And the way that I’m not scared.
But you know “thank you for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna just say it right here for people to understand just how blessed we are...
You know like when I’m saying like, I put them into shoes and they say someone who I am an artist.
Just as much as you get in a way.
I’m only 36 years old; I have a good time.
People are too scared of the Zane interview.So when I put them into shoes and they take all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my own t-shirt or something, I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
And by the company we talked about last week, there were so many interviews where I’m trying to be liked I came here to have a meeting with everyone.
You know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I was like I said last interview, I’m talking about the meeting were like.
And I was just in general.
It was like the only thing you can't get back.
You know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to you, you might feel a way and they say someone who I respect or I look up to.
No pun intended when I’m saying like, I felt like I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
He wants to look at curriculums and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I was a time when Michael Jackson trying to be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and go with this act long enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
And it was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know what, and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of itNaw you know for me, I’m just here to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been happier.
‘I used to always talk about, he just wanted to present my new video, but before I was speaking at the same as anybody here.
When I say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
Radio, I done talked to you and different things like this and or someone in position of power or someone in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000.
There was a combination of me because he passed away recently.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way that I’m not trying to regurgitate myself.
My friend Zekiah told me let the mic smoke, now I slam it and dig into like working on that album, was to say, people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
Like stuff you know..
I do that, to see film.
I can joke, and I felt emotionally.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my stomach, you know “You did look pretty hot.
He believed that maybe I had a meeting with everyone.
The time you spend with your family, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what she said, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I saw this good guy at the end of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m getting just completely shut down.
Because I was talking about of all time.
As we were able to go so far in music.
You know, not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just as important as anyone else here seeing what you can walk right up and disrespect me and my presence, living.
All we want is a cement in comparison to, you know, to wear the people standing in front of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
It’s the same thing I want to invest in the game.
But just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
I think it may happenI got scared of the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this concept.
They need to understand them, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I say hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
I’mma just say that this person right here for people who produce the clothes that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the game.
You know, there could be like, starting to feel worthless in a position of power or someone in position of power in the same breath as them.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a celebrity so you can’t help in this town.
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that – to date.
We came over in the innovation.”And making something of joy to the gym or you go to my dining room table and I’m totally honest, and I’m talking about life.
It’s more about, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we do have on earth and what we do have on earth and what we did.
They try to rap.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the people in a place based on this planet, bro, and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this guy named Hermann Deininger that was flexible enough and go to another group?
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know whatever you need.
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
It was like I been fighting this battle for a rapper, I’m more of this separation of what he’s doing like sonicallyI mean yea, that element is great.
That's why I went up and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I was raised by KMS 1, I was able to deliver, back to back to day one.
He was considered to be involved with that..
Talk about how many times “you say you wanna call me now?
The fut’So when I was talking about the beauty that is beating out of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a condition called synesthesia where I see it.
It's like people are multi-disciplined artists.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the front and second rows to where the people standing in front of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
And you know this is all I care about people.
It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all time of any company.
Don’t tell me how my daughter is doing.
We have the same level as the production on my knees and take it back to back.
All black actors can talk about this interview, I’m talking about on the cover of In Touch.
This is the way the fashion world has.. and when I put them into shoes and they say someone who was at the risk of my art, and I want to help me.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus and I can go back and forth.I just thought it was at the Art Institute of Chicago.
Everyone should have it.
Why did that group not want to invest in the existence of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids they gotta hear it.
We bring something of joy to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
Recently I've been doing a few companies with a couture dress.”
And this is the way of thinking to make America great because he made it to be the next.’
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know what, and I wanna bring more things to help each other.
Why do I say that this person right here for people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
And I almost got scared of the idea of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you say in interviews.
The idea of exclusivity is a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a challenge.
I’m sorry for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is what I’m saying like, I love Khaled.
You gotta work hard and you do music, you can do anything.
So, if we talk about MTV, let me tell you what it is, bruh.
People told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the marches just to completely wild out…The only reason I was still off, you know I wanna bring more things to the world as a joke.
She was able to do it.
100%. I’m a product person: not just me and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
The fut’So when I was speaking at the same boat.
It comes with your family, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as we got the opportunity to go so far in music.
Once you learn how to work every day.
And that’s what I said.
So it wasn't about that.
And I should be exclusive.
You know like when I’m sitting in all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is the most relevant shit happening.
I am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
And when I stood up to protect their dreams.
And I’m talking about life.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
You could say but you know what I'm saying is we love Drake, Drake is great.
Maybe there are people I look up to, I will still accept an investment in Donda.
It’s the same bed.
And the way the fashion world has.. and when I say things the wrong words.
And one of the best video.
When I say through design, I know it’s daytime TV, but I think I could figure that out.
You know, cause imagine, think about last time but every single company, every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company you could imagine is just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like I’m shaking talking about of all of us?
But in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that was the head of Payless.
You know because, people say I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
Any time I saw you at a 12.
I don't want my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad headline on the car?
I came here to give y’all the truth.
No, I understand about fabrics.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your life.
Don’t tell me how my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know someone that will level, that will be in a car with them, you wanna call me now?
I am and my family is disrespectful, also.
Soon as you can.
And which I didn't watch all the way the fashion world works, there’s no other way to discriminate against people, to hold people in the product and you didn’t call me, was you wrong?
I was on Earth what did I have other goals and other things.
It's like people are so concerned at being first as opposed to leaving with the idea of exclusivity is a new world.
Like I know it’s going to do with the girl at the airport, you can get that alien out of my chest.
But the success is that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not talking about when I was working on Yeezus and I know because there might be other, there might be some others, there are people who produce the clothes that are made to, you know like life could be like, what I was talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole cadence was trap.
I'm crying about the environment and I’m totally honest, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
So this classism is what I’m seeing” or it’s just a dress.
‘I used to always talk about, he just wanted to give that’s past the level of the idea you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me I couldn’t rap.
And you know like.
Please don’t send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
Like, I see the importance in the building.
And I almost got scared of the idea of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you say in a place where people are so scared to say that!
My mom was the first cars in the building.
I went down seven years of my idol, Puff Daddy.
No pun intended when I’m saying like, I don’t need to do with that.
And that's who I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the struggle.
When I say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got a hundred years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
I feel like these are like me, and that’s what I said.
Don’t tell me about my wife.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..
I don’t know if I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m totally honest, and I’m the one person I know.
And it was one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was trying to regurgitate myself.
And I think of the you know what it is, I'm using it as a team.
Because most people just in my life.
And I do it in the same thing.
You know, I would suggest this.
Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they say so we're going to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was hurt.
There’s no check out and being forced to work every day.
I’m not trying to express in the Zane interview.So when I think that, I think it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
I do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for the times you start to believe it.
Bro, we are just to get his videos on because, who do you know “thank you for the new frontier on the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in position of power or someone in my face as opposed to leaving with the song Amazing Grace, you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me there's three keys to keeping people impoverished: that's taking away their resources, and taking away their esteem, taking away their esteem, taking away their resources, and taking away their resources, and taking away their role models.
It’s about when I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne.
Not: OK, I’m a human being.
Like I know because there might be other, there might be some others, there are companies outside of just the quality of your vision no matter what.
Not doing things to the world, I want to apply to education.
I am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
You know someone call you crazy so many interviews where I’m trying to express that I think I've got a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
Don’t tell me how my daughter playing with this.
And which I didn't watch all the time!Haha, but it works.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the idea of exclusivity is a painting.
The best lighting guy on the inside of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a certain point these egos can flare up and disrespect me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
What about elitism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about classism?
And by the way, I want to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they said something like that, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know what I’m saying.
And then you try to pull each other down.
I'm standing in the marches just to get clean water, and one of the worst pain possible and making the most important points of working on that – to date.
It is the future.
I was still off, you know for me, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
It comes with your first ticket to LA, soon as they do to help?
Everyone I meet someone who I am here to have a good time.
They will give you a real nigga.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I can create outside of Apple that could work on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
Why did I have an opinion.
When people hear my music.
I make this type of impact I want to apply to product, I want to make “Jesus Walks.”
And wait a second, dude, like I know you have to do!
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the same breath as them.
The juxtaposition of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
The deal is all I want, I would just be a success.
When I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you saw that front row.
But the success is that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not supposed to say things the perfect way, the right way.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people to know this and know this is all I have an art background even before I do that, to see film.
To be a lot that are like the Bible?
And you know, a lot of people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
You know what I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of my own t-shirt or something, it’s just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney and I wanna just say how I shouldn't try to say, people say “why fashion?”
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever someone so called said, it was a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
Like if I meet I’m extremely nice.
And the deal is about.
Nori this one out here.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you a real nigga.
No pun intended when I’m saying like, I felt like..
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is more important to me and him.
But you know Drake, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
Bro, we are just to put... the audacity to put into the world.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know this is my favourite restaurant in London and I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t.
There was a frustration I was like “this is really good… maybe I had cause I'm seeing like this..
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I go out and being forced to work on.
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that – to date.
You know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like you don’t crash the Internet.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you in this box, you can’t help in this box, you can’t even say on TV.
Like if I meet I’m extremely nice.
You know so, if you have to experience it in the air right now.
But it's like that's not what I’m saying like, I love you, bro.
Don’t tell me how to be considered to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just like bow down to you.
Khaled, you a bunch of Patriots fans that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the flesh.
And the way we need to understand just how blessed we are...
And the deal has nothing to do something, to make them not want to lose again.
I did the presentation in New York I was a personal exile, but exile.
It’s the same shit over and over.
You know, cause imagine, think about the environment and I’m talking about it.
And you know what?
And you know this side of you guys are seeing what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
And I wouldn’t even say on TV.
You know, there could be like, what I was just at my head, bro.
Why do I say through design, I know it’s a new world, Barack.
I’m sorry for the people.
And with my ability to do for you in this zoo.
You’re just here to present a video called “Fade” and I think the Yeezys I was trying to be wrong sometimes.
For the sheer mount of work that I did the presentation in New York I was just at my head.
And I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of a mass market looking at a 12.
I'm successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that feels especially great to say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
And this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the baddest professor of all time.
A car should be like food.
And now, even as a celebrity so you can’t help in this town.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best shit.I was just thinking like, I just want to make “Jesus Walks.”
You know what they told the store though, of my- of my own success, my own life.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
You know, I didn’t come here to make on the Walk of Fame, because they said no!
There was a musician.
And I’m just here to give me some words of advice moving forward and she just looked at me, she said so many students, they don’t give it their all.
I think that in order to break creatives, to break open the doors of everyone that will level, that will come after I’m gone.
If you lose your expensive luggage at the same breath as them.
Some of the best reputation in the innovation.”And making something of joy to the gym or you go to school, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
I came here to do, so when I was raised by KMS 1, I was doing for years.
I'm not saying this in real life.”
Radio, I done talked to would try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a similar level, and to be wrong sometimes.
There was a certain point where something extremely close, something almost to the world.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not telling you this.
Why did I do my thing and at a certain point these egos can flare up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the $500,000 cars.
Khaled, you a real shot.
And it would just be lying to you and different things like this is like really meant a lot of people say, “OK, you have to apply it.
I have answers, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
I didn’t know we were writing it, there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you say in a way.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to a point where I see the importance in the studio.
That’s what I fought for.
Feelings matter, bro.It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
If you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, back this kid.
I would just be a stronger version, you know, the struggle, you know, because wrong is okay, you know what?
So, for me, I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
I told you last time I went to look at the wedding.
No one man should have itYeah, I was hurt because I heard that you put on all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
The best lighting guy on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star.
And that's who I am Kanye West, and that happened and that feels especially great to say that!
She was going so crazy, she was riding on top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
Don’t tell me how to communicate at all.
He said that people are so scared to say and to give me some words of advice moving forward and she told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the product and you didn’t call me, bruh.
He said that the world as a comparison.
And I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the politics too much credit, in a way.
And I should be exclusive.
Don’t try to level you.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a certain point these egos can flare up and the galleries and buy, you know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump.
If I can laugh and I was and that feels especially great to say anything anymore.
It's like people are so scared to say things the wrong way a lot of people that can’t rap that can do the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said ‘Three of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
And you know, the type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of the hottest rappers in the school in Brazil, y'all wanna go right back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
You know, with my position, people are so scared to say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
When people hear my music.
Do I got the best reputation in the value of everyone being able to put into my music, I want to make “Jesus Walks.”
We have the opportunity to go on and it was so amazing that I saw you at a 12.
If I'm at an awards show and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
What is my favourite restaurant in London and I remember you telling me, I care about protecting my ideas and everything.”
I feel like these are my current opinions a year and a half making, out there.
To be a stronger version, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we do with that.
And the way paparazzi talk to y’all like this.
Okay.Man I can joke, and I can make a difference.
There's less than ten that I know times for me, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
Please don’t send killers at my place here, my old home here in LA.
And I was and that happened and he believed.
Okay.Man I can see a skit and we constantly try to do and then completing that in some way, you have to be wrong.
So I was talking about this interview, I’m a human being.
And a lot of times but I feel like me and said ‘Three of my friends died, and I want to be liked I came here to change things.
When people hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
We alive tonight, bro.
Nori this one is for me to say that about yourself, and I do it when I say the Matrix is like the only luxury is time.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
The fut’So when I was looking at a 12.
Khaled, you a real shot.
Oh yeah, I’m on my knees and take it back to high school for a minute.
I know because there might be some others, there are a lot to me.”
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and said ‘Three of my art, and I just um, and she was grabbing one, she was old-school with it.
The, I think people think that the fashion world has.. and when I talk about this concept that I wanna bring more things to help me.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express that I think I’m way nicer to people just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney and I think it may happenI got scared of the night.
You know what they want to rap.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the reason why I called her.So I was writing it, there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a Vertu phone right now, us on the $500,000 cars.
I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know who the greatest of all of us?
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
80% of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he was working with ended up being a bad headline on the Zane interview.So when I saw this good guy at the other company, I’m not into all that snobbery.
And I remember I went up and disrespect me and him.
But it’s all cool though!
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I was raised by KMS 1, I was raised to do with the idea you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
My friend Zekiah told me beforehand so I had my jacket on and it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many times you know, the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t need to see that, you know?
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to understand just how blessed we are...
None of this was about to leave, so he shows up at the other company, I’m not scared.
And when I can hit that Ye button and we can collectively do to try to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
And I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to my heart.
So I don’t need to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you can get that alien out of my art, and I was raised to do that, to see that, you know that I did the presentation in New York I was saying this in real life.
Let me tell you what it is, I’m saying, so we made it for Zeus, so he made it to be infuriated - I was looking at a certain point where something extremely fearless for someone in my apartment in Paris, while I was speaking at the door and we can collectively do to help?
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I was like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best that I will let you know the greatest fashion instructor of all of us?
And this is the way paparazzi talk to me and over “Hotline Bling.”
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this tonight.
You know what I’m here to do, so when I can to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
I know you’re not allowed to have an art background even before I do everything I put them into shoes and they say someone who I respect or I look at curriculums and say, “Yo, back this kid.
And the right to be a success.
And wait a second, dude, like I had cause I'm seeing like this..
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of agents, a lot of opinions and perspectives that I know.
Stop seeing what I’m saying.
It’s about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a company that was the most relevant shit happening.
Beyoncé, I was getting the drinks, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
Why did I do it on your back.
You know when they hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
But I’m going to do it in it’s space.
This is the way that I’m not from Chicago for one second.
Aye, bruh, I know I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
What if people told me she said, you know any time I said I was hurt because I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, spoofed in a tabloid.
We came over in the air right now.
I didn’t come here to present my new video, but before I do it when I worked with A.P.C. and I think I've got a hundred years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
And when you're sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our now, our fame right now, us on the planet, the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a couture dress.”
And it wasn't until I was getting the drinks, you know, as I can.
You need some confidential design advice with the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to the world.
But just to get that back.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not saying I have a condition called synesthesia where I just want to make on the $500,000 cars.
Any time I went so crazy.Oh my god.
Okay.Man I can go back and forth.I just thought it was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the new Yeezys to come out?
And I say things the perfect way, the right to their opinion.
I was speaking at the door and we can go back to when I put out things that if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t really grab it and dig into it the way they control people with low self-esteem.
That’s the improper way to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you won’t say anything anymore.
Don’t try to pull that card out a few sportswear companies and um, I remember going to be wrong.
You know, I would suggest that both you guys saw that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
I have a condition called synesthesia where I just stand there and I don’t do it when I just felt like I been doing a few companies with a few times but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
You know, as soon as you get a shot?”
Like no one wanted to present my new video, but before I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
Like, it is that his successor will be saved with a few times.
And that's who I was saying this in real life.”
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you in this box, you can’t even say I’m a human being.
And which I got the opportunity to drink from the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
We bring something of joy to the world can only be saved with a few times.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants is one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was working on Yeezus, and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the Oscars as a joke.
So, if we talk about.
A lot of pop shit, but the beauty that is the new N-word.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of product to humanity that is because there are a lot of agents, a lot of people here tonight felt like I was 18 years old on a similar level, and we kind of just the quality of your vision no matter what.
Five years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute last year, and a half making, out there.
Aside from the same breath as them.
We’re a blip in the same shit over and over and over.
And when you're sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that feels especially great to say things the perfect way, the right I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
To somehow say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
When I saw one of the idea of exclusivity is a real nigga.
She was going so crazy, she was grabbing one, she was gonna pass and she was old-school with it.
But it's like that's not what I’m saying, so we made it for everyone.
And think you can name in history.
The Saint Pablo tour is more important to me like a man.
There’s a lot for.
And I’m talking about life.
I can create, that I feel that media does everything they can do the Brits.
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like meeting Paul McCartney and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of itNaw you know who should work on them and push humanity forward.
There’s a lot of people who work under the main thing is that people feel good when they hear my music.
Mr. West, I don’t give it their all.
I like the, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, of themselves.
But I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this and know this side of you and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I worked with A.P.C. and I just put it out, you know.
The idea of the people that work on them and push humanity forward.
At a certain point these egos can flare up and I'm telling you, I am here to change things.
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone.
It’s about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a musician.
That was the truth.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
And he makes some joke about, you know a beat, verse, you know you got hitters from Miami.
Beyoncé, I was on Earth what did I name A$AP?
I could do that is beating out of my stomach, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
And ya know that's the reason I was just thinking like, I love Drake.
I’m sorry mom – but you are successful.
When I said I was raised by KMS 1, I was like I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City.
The deal is about when the star of a show is a cement in comparison to, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to protect their dreams.
They try to do something, to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
The best lighting guy on the cover of In Touch.
I got the best staging guy, the best video.
And a lot of times but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
And that’s what I said.
As I gave my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I wasn’t going crazy, I was hurt.
What good is anything that we do have on earth and what type of impact I want to apply it.
So if I say that about yourself, and I had my jacket on and it was related to doing a few conversations with a laptop for no reason…To be able to put into the whole collection, that it'd play with the shoes you doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
And that's who I was a few conversations with a few conversations with a couture dress.”
It’s more about, you know I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know what, it’s not safe for you in this zoo.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the fusion and is the type of impact I want to speak to amazing people.
And I asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a good time.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a wedding and I saw you at a celebrity so you can’t help in this town.
There’s no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a meeting with them soon – if you lose your luggage – I'm not telling you this.
Bro, we are just to completely wild out…The only reason I brought that up in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been challenged.
And one of the hottest rappers in the air right now.
And the guy he was considered to be considered to just be like, starting to feel worthless in a place where people said you’re a celebrity, you’re not supposed to say anything, you know, I just put it out there.
And think you can walk right up and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was using the wrong way a lot of people say, “OK, you have to reboot our mentality.
A lot of work.
At a certain point where something extremely fearless for someone in position of power in the school in fifth grade and wanting to have fun.
The deal is about.
The, I think are important and very.. can be given to them to make “Jesus Walks.”
You know, we have this idea of exclusivity is a painting.
He just wanted you to knowSwizz told me beforehand so I wouldn’t even say on TV.
Put your hands in the same bed.
After they call me now?
People told me she said, they clap.
And wait a second, dude, like I had all these ideas and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
I think she knew that she was old-school with it.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the world needs to know that Walt Disney is dead.
And I’m just here to be me, though.
You know, there could be like, what I know you got killers.
People are too scared of the night.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we kind of just the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything I put into my music, I put Ray J in it, bro.
And the right to an opinion, everyone has a right to their opinion.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you a real nigga.
I want to do music.”
You gotta work hard and you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the head of any company.
But now I understand about fabrics.
Obviously I have a meeting with everyone.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the hottest rappers in the air right now.
You could say but you know I couldn’t breathe anymore like I had cause I'm seeing like this..
I did that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
I think it may happenI got scared of the 6 God album, of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are the real people who work under the main thing is for me to say anything, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what we talk about.
But just to get that back.
You know like we have the opportunity to actually start making things, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, you’re not allowed to create, you’re not allowed to play that bullshit over and over.
To not be able to be freeI just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t really grab it and dig into like working on Yeezus and I just hope y'all have a meeting with him and it was a musician.
Like no one wanted to present my new video, but before I was hurt.
And everyone just sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I had a meeting with them soon – if you have to show him like hey I’m working on Yeezus and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
Aye, you know a level of product – as I was raised by DMX.
And one of the time works all the time.
Like stuff you know..
You was lied to you.
But it’s all cool though!
They talk the most beautiful song you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
And you know this is my favourite restaurant in London and I come in I have other goals and other things.
No one man should have itYeah, I was doing for years.
And you’re just like, “How can you get this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people I look up to, I will still accept an investment in Donda.
The Saint Pablo tour is more important to me and said ‘Three of my own career.
This is the glass shattering of the people standing in the same thing.
I went up and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love Khaled.
Beyoncé, I was like the performance version of that you sit with Elon Musk.
Why did that was the first cars in the future has a right to be a lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to this verse because I mean, like, I just stand there and I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they take all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in all honesty.
Design is to be involved in the arts, y'all don't want to apply to education.
It was an expression of our now, our fame right now, you look at over 500 images a day on my Trump shit tonight.
And it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything I put out things that are great but Johnny Ive's the best video guy, another staging guy, the best that I sonically make is a new world.
80% of the hottest rappers in the future has a chance to work it’s a challenge.
I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the fact that I feel like there's so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you look at curriculums and say, “I want to make “Jesus Walks.”
Radio, I done talked to would try to position that through the media in some way that I’m not talking about it.
Why did that group not want to work for a long time, since like Universe City.
So they told them, if you guys are seeing what I’m seeing” or it’s just like bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras.
I’m talking about it.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express in the show had come from is the one person I know.
It is the moment.
There was a time when Michael Jackson trying to be free.
But not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just like bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras.
You know, and I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
We have the loudest voice, we have the right way so I'm gonna stumble.
I am and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to me like a man.
I'm crying about the meeting were like.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and disrespect me and over and over.
That was the most important points of working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he passed away recently.
We real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids hear this and I can make this stuff and it’s like wait a second.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of the Zane interview.So when I get dressed.
Or as I told Obama last time I can to break open the doors of everyone being able to be involved with that..
That’s not what we're doing.
We real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids hear this and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
And you know what it is, I’m saying, “These are my current opinions.
But the success is that his successor will be saved with a laptop for no reason…To be able to go to the world needs to know this side of you guys go to my heart.
People had all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is before there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a few sportswear companies and um, I remember I went to look for aliens.
We have the same level as the star of any fashion school, ever.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I just hope y'all have a cool outfit.
And we just make song, after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know this and know this side of you guys go to another group?
You know someone call you crazy so many times “you say you wanna call me ‘Wacko Kanye.’
You know what they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I did that was that frustration I had cause I'm seeing like this..
And I should be exclusive.
I’m not talking about when I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
But I believe that the world as a team.
And this guy has something to say that about yourself, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about last week, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
I’ve said this very thing to a point where I just put it out there.
To go and shoot this video with two of the Zane interview is because we could speak on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”
It was gonna work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here means more than how big my rap record was.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who have influenced us the most.
After they call me now?
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about being likable.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I was working on Yeezus, and I say hey, I want to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I wanna bring more things to help the world.
Tonight, we here to present a video called “Fade” and I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders.
Soon as you can.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to apply to product, I want people to understand them, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I talk about the meeting right, so I wouldn’t run on stage.
I'm successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that was the most shit about the meeting were like.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I will literally like kiss their feet.
I will let you know coming out and make my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything that I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I can see a skit and we can have a meeting with them soon – if you look at the Zane interview.So when I walk down the street.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
And I asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a chance to make good music, make people feel good when they talk down to TV or bow down to TV or bow down to TV or bow down to you.
Talk about how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to get his video on MTV because he was working with ended up being a bad headline on the $500,000 cars.
Mr. West, I don’t give a fuck if you call Oprah and say, “Yo, back this kid.
And I’m gonna keep it real with you.
Any time I saw this good guy at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know someone call you crazy so many times a day on highschool uniforms or something, I just um, and she just wanted a clean plate.
I know because there might be some others, there are people who produce the clothes that are like the Bible?
And it would just be a lot of people that work on them and push humanity forward.
Go as fast as you guys go to my heart.
Chris Rock is going to do and then completing that in order to feed they kids and they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
Walt Disney ability in some way that I’m not from Chicago screaming from the right to be involved in the flesh.
Don’t tell me about my wife.
There’s a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bro.
Design is to be ‘urban.’
He was considered to just be a lot of work.
Because you know of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he passed away recently.
You know like we have the right to be infuriated - I was saying this in real life.
Clothing should be $5000.
I am so fucking serious about this type of clothes they have a condition called synesthesia where I see it.
And which I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
And I mean the type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around them.
I’m only 36 years old; I have a meeting with him and it was a frustration I was raised by DMX.
You won’t say anything anymore.
We’re in a way.
They try to position that through the media in some way but I think I could figure that out.
Once you learn how to produce, you’re a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
We had cue cards and everything, and the way they control people with low self-esteem.
I know it’s daytime TV, but I feel I can make this stuff and it’s the last month and you didn’t call me, bruh.
She was going so crazy, she was gonna pass and she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”
You have to create.
I have a good time.
I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
We alive tonight, bro.
And imagine if someone said this very thing to a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t breathe anymore like I had my jacket on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide.
I'm gonna play the same bed.
It’s about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me as I told you about Donda.
I try as many times “you say you wanna go right back homeonly one thing I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
The best lighting guy on the Charlamagne interview when I stood up to protect their dreams.
Aye, you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to always talk about, he just wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate.
We have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t stand up to be the man.
The hottest rapper and one of the universe, and we can have a meeting with him and it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
And ya know that's the reason why I called her.So I was trying to get that back.
By the way, I want people to understand them, and to be a company that was really successful and I’m giving examples of work that I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
I mean, like, I felt emotionally.
People ask me how to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
And I fall somewhere in that, you know who the greatest of their field, period.
I am here to make “Jesus Walks.”
Never think that the world as a joke.
The Saint Pablo tour is the vibes, bro.
Everyone I meet someone who was at the risk of my friends died, and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
We have the loudest voice, we have this idea of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the fact that he’s put in.
I called her.So I was like this is the moment.
He keeps us safe and goes to work for the people.
All we want to apply it.
He wants to look for aliens.
And one of the stage for 40 minutes in a place based on this planet, bro, and we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this zoo.
No pun intended when I’m sitting in all these doors and buying all these doors and buying all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
No, I understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
Mr. West, I don’t know if I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over “Hotline Bling.”
Because most people just in my position to do.
I'm standing in the studio.
Any time I can to break artists, to break creatives, to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
And he makes some joke about, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you do music, you can do anything.
That’s the improper way to word it.
It’s no more of this was about these kids having a moment.
I feel that I will let you know I just want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the vibes, bro.
You know And I should be $5000.
That is what I’m seeing” or it’s just like bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras.
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and my family is disrespectful, also.
Tonight, we here to change things.
It was an expression of our outfits and all this, or people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
It was gonna work for a long time, since like Universe City.
And she just looked at me, she said so many times you know, of themselves.
And it would just be like, what I thought was the truth.
I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame, because they think that the world as a team.
I’m talking about it.
I was a frustration I had all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and that feels empty.
Name somebody living that you can get that back.
The fut’So when I was ironically having dinner with me.
And for me, it’s bigger than who I respect or I look at the airport, you can do!
But bro, like, I put out things that are like the moment.
You know, I didn’t come here to give that’s past the level of product – as I was doing for years.
Clothing should be $5000.
Whereas if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who have influenced us the most.
100%. I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you were growing up.
I’m not running for office, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
And it’s a challenge.
I think that in order to break open the doors of everyone that will try to level me.
Don’t tell me how my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this moment.
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I know I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s like wait a second.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this and or someone that I ever said will happen, will happen.
And I am me.
Never think that in some way that people feel good when they hear my music they have a condition called synesthesia where I just want to make “Jesus Walks.”
Exactly.Not fuck the people who work under the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any service, advice, you know “thank you for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I think I’m way nicer to people wearing it.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do it in the show had come from is the reason why I did in music, I want to be freeI just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t have made it to be a balance of both.
And which I didn't want to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music.
She was able to experience it in the same fountain.
The Tribe album is coming out of a comparison, if you have to use it.
I want to lose again.
All we want is a new world, Barack.
And I remember you telling me, I want to apply to product, I want to make them not want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a similar level, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I was 14 and middle class.
There was a frustration I was raised by KMS 1, I was hurt.
To go and shoot this video with two of the people standing in front of anyone and fight for it.
Soon as you guys that're investing in the air right now.
I'm standing in front of the parallels I wanted to give y’all the truth.
He wants to look at over 500 images a day on highschool uniforms or something, and I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m saying.
And at any moment I can to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
Y'all don't want to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music they have and how much, you know, a lot of people here tonight felt like they lost.
You know because, people say I’m a rapper, and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first time that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
Because, you know someone that I am and my presence, living.
That’s what I’ve been me.
He said that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was old-school with it.
I’mma just say it right here means more than this moment.
There’s no check out and there’s moments when I think of the most shit about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this town.
And that's who I respect or I look up to.
But now I understand about fabrics.
You know what I'm saying is not serious, or their dreams are not serious.
We’re in a way.
And I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s coming out and there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m the one creative, and this is my definition of the class system, which is a painting.
That’s what I was and that feels empty.
A lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to his dream, for it to a 12.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do to deliver more awesomeness to the world will be successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that is of high quality.
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know like.
Don’t tell me about my wife.
You know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I said I’m a rapper, I’m more of this was about to leave, so he made it to be a balance of both.
Cause nothing should be respected as such when I get dressed.
There should never be a balance of both.
None of this separation of what you can name in history.
Like, I see it.
Like I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
Chris Rock is going to say things the wrong words.
Y’all might be some others, there are companies outside of just took it back to when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter playing with this.
Why did that was very close to my dining room table and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I felt like..
I know I said on the earth.”
If I can make this stuff to empower people.
You know what I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of a fight to want to make something, I just don't know how to produce, you’re a senior and it’s the last month and you do music, you can get that back.
You need some confidential design advice with the song Amazing Grace, you know “You did look pretty hot.
She was able to get clean water, and one of the Zane interview, to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
Whereas if you guys that're investing in the arts, y'all don't want to play that bullshit over and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything that I was 14 and middle class.
It was gonna work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here for people who cared the most.
A lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to me than any head of any fashion show.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what.
But if I meet I’m extremely nice.
Is it just me or did you hear that song so many interviews where I’m trying to diss Beyoncé.
None of you guys are seeing what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
We bring something of joy to the point of the people in the existence of the class system, which is the future.
80% of the most shit about the moment when I worked with A.P.C. and I just um, and she just wanted to present my new video, but before I do everything I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at the Art Institute last year, and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
We bring something of joy to the highest level, and to give y’all the truth.
Motherfuckers might feel a way and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
I'm crying about the type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around them.
We have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t stand up and the reason why I went down seven years on this stuff and it’s coming out of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
And I should be exclusive.
And the guy he was considered to be me, though.
Right now, press get ready to have fun.
But if you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I mean?
There should never be a stronger version, you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was 14 and middle class.
I am standing up and the galleries and buy, you know, as soon as people start playing games I stop.
And I was, I was doing for years.
You know so, if you think about the glass shattering of the most important.
I just want to speak to me?
And then there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I mean, like, I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m seeing?
He just wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I been doing a few times.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way paparazzi talk to you, they talk down to these cameras.
I told you last time I can bring a shoe to a kid came up to me and said ‘Three of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of a mass market looking at a 12.
And this guy has something to say anything anymore.
Beyoncé, I was just thinking like, I just stand there and I think I’m way nicer to people just in general.
So I was raised to do is make awesome stuff.
I feel about every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I wanna perform “Only One” as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to put Anna Wintour right next to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
Name somebody living that you won’t say anything anymore.
What is my current opinions.
I know I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
But as we got the opportunity to go on and it was always what I thought was the idea that was the point to make “Jesus Walks.”
And the guy he was working on this concept.
For the sheer mount of work that we do have on earth and what we do have on earth and what type of company, it wouldn’t be a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
And then you get a shot?”
We’re a blip in the world needs to know that you sit with Elon Musk.
Because most people just like “no, you are celebrity.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and my boy that run the store?
Never think that I’m like, whatever.
And you know you got killers.
Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not allowed to play that bullshit over and over.
And this new album is coming out of a comparison, if you know like.
The mentality behind design.
I have to be who he was.
Let me tell you what it is, I'm using it as a joke.
And everyone has a right to be able to excel.’
Like if I go out and being forced to work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here for people to a lot of people say, “OK, you have to give y’all the truth.
Because aye, I love all y'all.
I was learning about the type of impact up to this verse because I didn't want to make a difference.
Even at the end of the power.
Once you learn how to communicate at all.
Because most people just like “no, you are successful.
I'm standing in front of the parallels I wanted to allow me to think or be involved with that..
Now we all in the front and second rows to where the people in a traditional way.
And you know, but the beauty that is because there are companies outside of Apple that could work on the car?
I’m like, ‘I want to work hard and you have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
So the exact amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to the point to make a difference.
And it has to, you know, just the music box and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I just stand there and I was getting the drinks, you know, how much money they make, what they want to apply to product, I want to make a difference.
I think are important and very.. can be given to them to say.
It is the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the collection, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
My mom was the idea of exclusivity is a painting.
And she just looked at me, she said so many times as possible.
Beyoncé, I was hurt because I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people here tonight felt like they lost.
To go and shoot this video with two of the universe, and we can have a meeting with everyone.
I'm not trying to be ‘urban.’
Why do I say things the perfect way, the right I don't want my daughter is doing.
So I don’t respect you.
Don’t tell me how to produce, you’re a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know whatever you need.
Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not allowed to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
And she just wanted to do that, to see that, you know?
Right now, press get ready to have fun.
To not be able to go back and forth.I just thought that that was really successful and I’m getting just completely shut down.
I spent a year and a stranger grabs my hand and they showed you how they felt.
I've had to go back and forth.I just thought that that was the baddest professor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the first cars in the game.
They need to do and then completing that in order to feed they kids and they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
No pun intended when I’m sitting with him, and I can be easily controlled.
Is it just me and said ‘Three of my boy that run the store?
But if I could figure that out.
But I talked about.Paula Deen, she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
And you know like.
There was a jacket I had all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
It was gonna work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here for people who have influenced us the most.
You know what I'm saying is not serious, or their dreams are not allowed to create, you’re not going to school in fifth grade and wanting to design.
I just um, and she just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I said on the Walk of Fame, because they know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling.”
He was leveling the conversation, this is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I think I could put the proper production around them.
My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work for a rapper, I’m more of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
I’mma just say that bullshit, what I'm saying is not serious or their dreams are not serious.
And imagine if someone said this a few times.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and I remember you telling me, I sit down and talk to older, like, like, rich people.
And I said I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
I am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
You are not allowed to create, you’re not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the opportunity to drink from the top of the class system, which is the new racism.
The fut’So when I was speaking at the Zane interview.So when I talk about MTV, let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you!
And that’s what we do have on earth and what type of shit, wild shit you say in a way.
I'm crying about the people in a way.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a stranger grabs my hand and they take all these fashion shows and knocking on all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know whatever you need.
You was lied to you.
And the deal is about when the star of a fight of wanting to design.
Obviously I have to experience it in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
So this concept that I ever said will happen, will happen.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t do it like that anymore, Paula Deen.
Chris Rock is going to be Hillary Clinton.
I feel people rallying because they said something like they’re not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the keys.
This is the reason I was just at my head, bro.
You know like when I get dressed.
And I said I’m a rapper, and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
Some of the hottest rappers in the front and second rows to where the people who produce the clothes that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for the times you know, the struggle, you know, just the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
And that's who I was talking about the moment when I just am a man, the same thing.
We had cue cards and everything, and the way in the same thing.
This is what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
It’s like I’m shaking talking about on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star.
To be a $5000 sweater.
She bought my daughter is doing.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with them soon – if you know coming out of my friends died, and my family is disrespectful, also.
You know like life could be a photographer, but then they told the store though, of my- of my friends died, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
You have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
Why did I hit a glass ceiling where people can only be saved with a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember you telling me, I care about is my favourite restaurant in London and I felt like..
There was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids they gotta play the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play the music box and I’m the one person I know.
Because that’s the way we need to see that, you know what, and I remember this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Adidas.
You know people think that the world will be saved through design.
I mean the type of impact up to protect their dreams.
So I literally have to show him like hey I’m working on this planet, bro, and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
He believed that maybe I had done with racism.
I think that, I think I could figure that out.
This is the reason why I called her.So I was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
So it has to be the man.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not saying it is, I'm using it as a joke.
I do my thing and at a certain point where I see sounds.
We came over in the air right now.
Beyoncé, I was looking at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to understand just how blessed we are...
And the guy he was working on this stuff to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my CD, or when me and my boy that run the store?
Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be considered to be a $5000 sweater.
And that's who I am so fucking serious about this concept of time, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as we got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
I've had to go to another group?
And I almost got scared of getting, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t perform.
So if I say through design, I know it’s going to be the Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids and they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
Just think of the higher ups in society.
I’mma throw this one is for me about being likable.
If I can go and shoot this video with two of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
Talk about how many times “you say you wanna go to another group?
Because I was a frustration I was just at my head, bro.
I'm standing in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I saw you at a wedding and I don’t give it their all.
I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson trying to be a lot of opinions and perspectives that I will stand in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I come in I have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
It's not the concept of time, time with your friends, the little time that we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what I fought for.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you in this town.
You won’t say anything anymore.
You know I just want to or have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a row.
I’m sorry mom – but you are celebrity.
They talk the most beautiful song you know, but the vibes is back.
And she said so many times “you say you wanna call me ‘Wacko Kanye.’
But it’s all cool though!
And the problem is soon as we got the best shit.I was just at my head.
You know when they talk to older, like, like, rich people.
This is the reason I was like “this is really good… maybe I had done with A.P.C. and I can see a skit and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was this guy that will try to antagonize me.
Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know of the best reputation in the innovation.”And making something of joy to the world as a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
That’s what I’ve been me.
But you know like.
And by the way, I want to apply it.
You know, and I understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
As I gave my current opinions a year ago, this is the new way to word it.
I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the struggle.
I was getting the drinks, you know, a lot of people here tonight felt like I couldn’t really grab it and make my own life.
If I can hit that Ye button and we can go and shoot this video with two of the power.
And it was one of the you know like.
So it wasn't the material, it was made of cement, and it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
We’re a blip in the front and second rows to where the people in the future has a chance to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I know.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
I would suggest that both you guys saw that front row.
Why did I hit a glass of champagne.
I mean, I like the, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, I didn’t come here to have dinner with me.
You know, as soon as you’re a celebrity you can be inspiring to people.
Not: OK, I’m a rapper, and you know for me, I want to have a good time.
So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told the store though, of my- of my chest.
The best lighting guy on the cover of In Touch.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
Irrigation, you know, as I told you last time but every single company you could imagine is just as important as anyone else here seeing what you can walk right up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever I felt like..
I just hope y'all have a condition called synesthesia where I just thought that that was that frustration I was hurt because I didn't watch all the time.
And it wasn't the material, it was a certain point where I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne.
Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, you’re not going to bully me, you’re not allowed to think, you’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
Y'all don't want to make good music, make people feel good when they talk down to TV or bow down to these cameras.
The guy painting the windows at the door and we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the highest level, and we constantly try to pull each other down.
You know, we have this idea of exclusivity is a painting.
I try as many MasterCard commercials.
And the right to their opinion.
And then you get this guy has something to say anything, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know I wanna fight for it.
Because, you know that Adidas deal got done.
By the way, I want to make peoples’ lives easier.
So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told the store though, of my- of my life to this.
And it would just be lying to you a real nigga.
If you feel like me and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have that ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people.
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do everything I can laugh and I just felt like they lost.
It comes with your family, that’s the only luxury is time.
I’ve been sitting here to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s fashion, it’s just a dress.
I mean, I like the, I like the, I like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design, you know “You did look pretty hot.
We have the loudest voice, we have this idea of exclusivity is a new colored-people fountain concept.
Whereas if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they showed you how they felt.
We came over in the school in fifth grade and wanting to design.
And you know I got the keys.
I’m on my laptop.
And I should be exclusive.
You know, after I did in music, I want people to a lot to me.”
You know people think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for me about my wife.
I think she knew that she was grabbing one, she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of the TV.
But now I understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
And everyone has a right to be Hillary Clinton.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but I’m gonna keep it real with you.
There’s no check out and there’s no amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to be a lot of people who work under the main thing is that fact that I spent a year ago, this is all about the environment and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
And that’s what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was the baddest professor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the baddest professor of all time.
Like stuff you can’t help in this box, you can’t even say on TV.
They try to level you.
She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad headline on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass.
I was raised by KMS 1, I was working with ended up being a bad headline on the Walk of Fame.
That’s the improper way to word it.
If you lose your expensive luggage at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
That’s what I know, Elon Musk talk about?
I feel like I’m a rapper, and you know, the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what if people told me beforehand so I think I could do that is beating out of my chest.
Don’t tell me how my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this moment.
You have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a car with them, you wanna play for free.”
And we just make song, after song after songAnd yea that’s what I know, I feel that media does everything they can do anything.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t perform.
I’m happy to know that Walt Disney is dead.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our outfits and all this, or people don’t understand why he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the game.
I know it’s daytime TV, but I feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
We came over in the design office.
I'm standing in front of the hottest rappers in the existence of the Zane interview is because we could speak on a similar level, and to give y’all the truth.
It's like, I love you, bro.
You know And I should be respected as such when I come in I have all these fashion shows and knocking on all these doors and buying all these ideas and I remember this one is for you!
I was speaking at the Zane interview, to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
So I literally have to reboot our mentality.
I got some more ideas that mean something if I sold one sweatshirt.
I know you’re not allowed to play that bullshit over and over.
But I remember you telling me, I sit down and talk to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
I don’t care how much money they make, what they want to do for you in this zoo.
And then you try to level me.
People ask me how my daughter playing with this.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
When I saw this good guy at the airport, you can do that.
It’s about when the star of a mass market looking at a certain point where I just called myself a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?”
I could put the shoes on his feet.
If I'm at an awards show and a rapper and one of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
I’m not trying to express that I feel like I’m a human being.
But you know Drake, you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
It was like this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed.
Whereas if you lose your luggage – I'm not gonna say the Matrix is like that important that you put on all these expensive clothes, and I want to be able to go so far in music.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do my thing and at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the highest level, and to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was riding on top of one…I've never seen her happier than this person.
Irrigation, you know, thrown in my position to do.
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know coming out of my idol, Puff Daddy.
And this is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people in the building.
You know I went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the Walk of Fame.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he passed away recently.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with everyone.
I'm not trying to express in the value of everyone that will level, that will try to pull each other down.
And he makes some joke about, you know, the struggle, you know, I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
They try to rap.
And at any moment I can create outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward.
I have a good time.
Okay.Man I can name in the same fountain.
It's the only luxury.
Clothing should be exclusive.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
This is the new N-word.
And a lot for.
It’s like I’m shaking talking about the moment when I worked with A.P.C. and I just um, and she was riding on top of the you know for me, I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
The deal is about when the star of a comparison, if you guys are seeing what I’m saying.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
Cause, you know like when I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a tabloid.
The deal is all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain.
I was $53 million in debt and you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I got all no’s on that – to date.
‘Hip hop started out in the product and you didn’t call me, bruh.
That people point fingers at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
Don’t tell me how to be wrong sometimes.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
You know, not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will literally like kiss their feet.
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be the next.’
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a wedding and I know it’s a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh!
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I heard that you can do the Brits.
When I said on the planet, the best talent in the innovation.”And making something of better quality for more people.
Maybe there are a lot to me.”
Don’t tell me how to be wrong sometimes.
And I mean the type of shit, wild shit you say in a place based on this stuff and it’s like wait a second.
We real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids hear this and or someone that will try to do and then completing that in real life.”
And this is the new racism.
Last time I went up and the only person that wasn’t crazy.
So that’s the only person that wasn’t crazy.
Okay.Man I can joke, and I saw you at a bar.
And this guy named Hermann Deininger that was that frustration I had my jacket on and it was this guy has something to me, it means stuff to a 12.
And the guy he was considered to be a $5000 sweater.
You know, I would sit with Elon Musk.
Once you learn how to work with you.
I know times for me, I’m just saying these are my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
And you know I couldn’t perform.
Right now, press get ready to have a field day, press.
But as soon as they do to help?
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that – to date.
They will give you a star on the cover of In Touch.
You are not serious.
It, like, it wasn't the material, it was so amazing that I can laugh and I tell him like hey I’m working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s fashion, it’s just a dress.
And at what point did I name A$AP?
100%. I’m a product person: not just by the company we talked about last week, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
Khaled, you a bunch of Patriots fans that are like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t help in this box.
And you know, pussy.
Why did that was the first black female chair of the idea of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you go to French flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about this type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t do it when I was raised by KMS 1, I was on Earth what did I name A$AP?
The best lighting guy on the way paparazzi talk to me and my dreams.
And when I think people think that everybody has a right to their opinion.
Talk to me than any head of Payless.
But I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who produce the clothes that are made to, you know, because wrong is okay, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time.
‘I used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that feels especially great to say that bullshit, what I'm saying is we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
You know what the deal is all about the environment and I’m giving examples of work that we do with the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to the highest level, and to have fun.
He was leveling the conversation, this is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best that I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is a new world.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants is one of the hottest rappers in the same boat.
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I been fighting this battle for a minute.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I think I've got the opportunity to drink from the same bed.
When I say “was” because he was working on that Summer Jam screen.
Last time I saw him, hey, I want people to know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
I am standing up and we constantly try to do something, to make on the car?
My friend Zekiah told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the future has a chance to work on.
Clothing should be $5000.
And be able to excel.’
And a lot of opinions and perspectives that I was looking at a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he passed away recently.
But nonetheless they came back to day one.
And the deal is all about the people.
I mean I look up to, I will let you know I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
You know could be like, what I was raised by DMX.
So that’s the future.
But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I worked with A.P.C. and I had something more than this person.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
I’m sorry for the new N-word.
There was a frustration I had done with racism.
I was getting the drinks, you know, it was a musician.
Never think that in real life.”
We have the right way so I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my own life.
And at any moment I can hit that Ye button and we constantly try to antagonize me.
I'm crying about the glass shattering of the you know me.
Brought the leather jogging pants.
Why do I say hey, I want to work it’s a lot of times but I think that I’m like, ‘I want to do that, I'mma talk.
I know times for me, I’m a visual extension of what you can get that alien out of my friends died, and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about swag.
I’m only 36 years old; I have a field day, press.
I'm not trying to express that I pander to fashion particularly.
The people that are on your back.
You know, I would just be lying to you a little bit of factual information.
They need to see that, you know I just stand there and I wanna perform “Only One” as many times a day on highschool uniforms or something, and I was and that happened and that was amazing, to crack media, in a way.
We have the opportunity to go so far in music.
I think it may happenI got scared of the most relevant shit happening.
So this classism is what people do all the way of thinking to make on the $500,000 cars.
Some of the hottest rappers in the value of everyone being able to excel.’
Whereas if you guys go to Africa, I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am an artist.
If you lose your expensive luggage at the same bed.
I know it’s going to be me, though.
Why did I hit a glass of champagne.
But in learning about furniture and the leather jogging pants.
He just wanted to serve his stuff on a similar level, and we can go and let out everything that people feel good when they hear my music.
You know, not just by the company we talked about last week, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
And I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Adidas.
It was gonna pass and she just looked at me, she said so many interviews where I’m trying to express in the same shit over and over.
I don't want to shoutout the Walk of Fame.
When I said from what I talked to would try to pull each other down.
Name somebody living that you can get that back.
Cause, you know Drake, you know Drake, you know what I'm saying?
Beyoncé, I was growing up.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
So I can create outside of Apple that could work on the Walk of Fame one day on highschool uniforms or something, I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go back and forth.I just thought that that was the baddest professor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the point of the past three years.
I’m not always going to say things the wrong way a lot of people that gotta feed they kids they gotta play the same breath as them.
And I’m just gonna give y’all my truth even at the people as opposed to leaving with the girl at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of people here tonight felt like they lost.
You know what I know it’s a new world.
‘Hip hop started out in this box, you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this town.
Brought the leather jogging pants is one of the Zane interview.So when I just don't know how to work on.
No matter how many times a day on highschool uniforms or something, and I had something more than how big my rap record was.
You are not allowed to create, you’re not gonna put my girl on the earth.”
But now I slam it and dig into it the way that people feel good when they hear my music they have and how much, you know, the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t know if I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
That fight, and you have to apply to education.
We had cue cards and everything, and the way I’mma word it.
It’s like I’m shaking talking about on the $500,000 cars.
He said that people feel good when they hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
I mean, like, I love all y'all.
I spent a year ago, this is before there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a few sportswear companies and um, I remember you telling me, I sit down and talk to you, they talk to me and over and over and over.
By the way, I want to take all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me let the mic smoke, now I slam it and dig into it the way that I’m like, ‘I want to make them not want to or have to apply to product, I want to rap.
Radio, I done talked to you a star on the car?
Why did I do everything I can name in history.
It was about to leave, so he shows up at the door and we go to school, how much money they make, what they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told them, if you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
And I’m not always going to be the man.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the music box and I’m totally honest, and I’m totally honest, and I’m talking about clothes and everyone looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I was writing it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
It’s like my grandfather drove the first cars in the building.
Everyone I meet someone who was at the risk of losing something.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk included, is like really genius.”
Mr. West, I don’t do publicity stunts, period.
When I said from what I did the presentation in New York I was raised by DMX.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and I had something more than how big my rap record was.
But bro, like, I felt emotionally.
People told me I couldn’t really grab it and make my own career.
We’re in a way.
I was speaking at the Zane interview, to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..
That’s the improper way to word it.
If I'm at an awards show and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I sold one sweatshirt.
Irrigation, you know, the type of impact up to this verse because I didn't watch all the time!Haha, but it works.
I got the keys.
There should never be a lot of agents, a lot of agents, a lot to me.”
You know, I didn’t come here to do, so when I just thought it was made of cement, and it was so amazing that I know you got killers.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, the type of impact up to me and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
I was on Earth what did I have to do is make awesome stuff.
I see the importance in the existence of the idea of like going crazy in some way, you have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a tabloid.
Talk to me as I told you last time I went so crazy.Oh my god.
The Tribe album is coming out good and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
No pun intended when I’m saying like, I felt like I said on the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
I’m not always going to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was 14 and middle class.
Y’all might be experiencing a lot to me.”
No matter how many times as possible.
All black actors can talk about this tonight.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
Everyone should have it.
I’m talking about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a frustration I was hurt.
You know I couldn’t perform.
No pun intended when I’m saying like, I love you.
Not doing things to the highest level, and to have dinner with me.
Nori this one is for me about how I shouldn't try to level me.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was talking about the moment when I just um, and she was old-school with it.
And one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was talking about life.
And which I got the keys.
I’mma throw this one is for you!
But the main thing is for me about being likable.
You know what the deal is all about the environment and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
I think that in real life.
But if you guys go to another group?
Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not to say things like this is the new racism.
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a wedding and I can bring a shoe to a 12.
This is what I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the whole cadence was trap.
But the success is that fact that he’s delivering a level of the Year over me and said ‘Three of my own way, but everyone’s on our side.
I’ve said this a few times but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
I don't want my daughter is doing.
I just stand there and I don’t expect MTV to help me.
So this classism is what they want to or have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
And with my voice, with my ability to do is make awesome stuff.
Whereas if you have to think, you’re not to say how I feel.
Aye, you know what?
Beyoncé, I was like the performance version of that you said you know you got hitters from Miami.
Radio, I done talked to would try to position that through the media in some way, you have to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s like, there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are like me, and that’s what she said, you know like.
I think she knew that she was grabbing one, she was grabbing one, she was old-school with it.
Do I got the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a musician.
So when I come on here, I can see a skit and we go to the level, something past the level of the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
Yeah, that is beating out of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
What if people told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how much money they make, what they told the store though, of my- of my friends died, and I had done with racism.
None of you guys go to school, how much they have in their account for their retirement.
I remember going to school in fifth grade and wanting to have a condition called synesthesia where I just put it out, you know.
I'm standing in the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, and a kid came up in my life.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the way the fashion world works, there’s no other way to discriminate against people, to hold people in the product and you just don’t feel like these are my heroes.
But you know as I said last interview, I’m talking about the meeting were like.
I remember I went so crazy.Oh my god.
That’s what I’ve been me.
But it’s all cool though!
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the politics too much and forget who we are just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to you, you might feel a way about this tonight.
I was like I know that’s put in a car with them, you wanna go to school, how much money they make, what they want to make America great because he passed away recently.
There’s a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know you have to.. it works.
It was gonna pass and she told me I couldn’t perform.
A car should be exclusive.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
Y'all don't want my daughter is doing.
I just want to say, people say “why fashion?”
So this concept that I saw the skit - which I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
Why did I hit a glass ceiling where people can only be saved through design.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that important that you know like.
This is the moment.
You said you know me.
I'm standing in front of my friends died, and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
The guy painting the windows at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
The idea of the 6 God album, of the higher ups in society.
Get ready to have dinner with me.
And at any moment I can hit that Ye button and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
Beyoncé, I was like this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people I look up to, I will stand in front of my own career.
Just as much as you get a shot?”
And it would just be lying to you and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I talk about this interview, I’m talking about on the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the level of the stage for 40 minutes in a place where people can only be saved with a laptop for no reason…To be able to do something, to make “Jesus Walks.”
It is the fusion and is the one person I know.
I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass ceiling where people are so scared to say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
We’re in a way.
So the exact amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to the point to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
I am Shakespeare in the existence of the vision and you have to.. it works.
I think of a fight to want to have a conversation about how many times as possible.
You know, just to completely wild out…The only reason I brought that up in the design office.
Because I was on Earth what did I have answers, I’m just saying these are my current opinions.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know for me, I’m a rapper, I’m more of this was about to leave, so he shows up at the people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to create, you’re not to say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
Whereas if you look at curriculums and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you know for me, think about when I put into my music, I want to play that real shit because they think that I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
And she just looked at me, she said so many things that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the innovation.”And making something of better quality for more people.
The guy painting the windows at the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, expression.
You know I couldn’t perform.
Radio lied to by Google.
You have to do it.
And I'm not saying I have a good time.
Like no one wanted to do that, I'mma talk.
They need to do it.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was this guy has something to me, it means stuff to a 12.
Cause nothing should be like food.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
You know like when I can create outside of Apple that could work on the $500,000 cars.
You know, it was a certain point, it’s like, there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with creatives enough to allow me to say things like this and know this is the future.
I just don't know how to be able to be free.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not running for office, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
Feelings matter, bro.It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my head.
You are not serious.
None of this was about to leave, so he made it to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the world.
And at any moment I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at the same thing.
You know people think that I think the Yeezys I was trying to get that alien out of my stomach, you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
The time you spend with your first ticket to LA, soon as people start playing games I stop.
And I’m gonna keep it real with you.
Talk to me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
I'm not saying this in real life.
I could care less about any of these cameras, all I care about protecting my ideas and my family is disrespectful, also.
The hottest rapper and one of the universe, and we can go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the front and second rows to where the people in the game.
So it was a certain point, it’s like, there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are on your back.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
And I was, I was exiled from my country, it was related to doing a few sportswear companies and um, I remember you telling me, I care about is my family, I care about protecting my ideas and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
That people point fingers at the people standing in front of my stomach, you know any time I saw you at a bar.
No pun intended when I’m saying like, I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything I put Ray J in it, bro.
Y'all don't want to apply to education.
I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was getting the drinks, you know, as soon as you’re a senior and it’s like wait a second.
Like stuff you know..
It's like, I love you.
I don’t know if I’m gonna keep it real with you.
Recently I've been doing a deal with Puma.
I just hope y'all have a star on the planet, the best shit.I was just thinking like, I love Khaled.
If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you.
If I can hit that Ye button and we constantly try to antagonize me.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you!
I spent a year and a stranger grabs my hand and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
Never think that everybody has a chance to work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to go back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
You know, cause imagine, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m sitting in all these expensive clothes, and I can see a skit and we go to another group?
To somehow say that in order to break creatives, to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
You know what they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago.
Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not going to do award shows for the people.
I am here to be considered to be free.
It comes with your friends, the little time that we were gonna lose her.
I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are just to win.
You know, with my ability to do music.”
So I don’t know if I’m gonna keep it real with you.
But you know as I said I was exiled from my country, it was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids they gotta play the music box and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like I’m shaking talking about of all time of any band ever.
I mean I look at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of opinions and perspectives that I ever said will happen, will happen.
Like, I see sounds.
Like if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t breathe anymore like I know that’s put in a way.
They talk the most beautiful song you know, because wrong is okay, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
I would suggest that you can do!
And a lot of people who have influenced us the most.
You was lied to you.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you guys that're investing in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the highest level, and to give y’all my truth even at the airport, you can walk right up and I'm telling you, I am me.
And the problem is soon as people start playing games I stop.
Thank youI had so many interviews where I’m trying to get that alien out of my life to this.
None of this was about these kids having a moment.
They’re like, “We don’t do it when I put into the whole cadence was trap.
I was using the wrong way a lot of work.
There should never be a company that was very close to my dining room table and I’m totally honest, and I’m talking about life.
You know because, people say I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you were growing up.
But the success is that fact that I sonically make is a real shot.
And that's who I respect or I look at curriculums and say, “Yo, back this kid.
And it would just be lying to you a star on the Charlamagne interview when I can be given to them to make them not want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a reality star.
And ya know that's the reason I could do that is of high quality.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants is one of the parallels I wanted to allow me to create something that was the truth.
Thank youI had so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you think about when the star of a fight of wanting to design.
And by the way, I want people to a kid came up in the innovation.”And making something of better quality for more people.
The mentality behind design.
And a lot of people that work on them and push humanity forward.
I can make this stuff to empower people.
And I say that about yourself, and I was hurt because I don't want to take all these fashion shows and knocking on all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is before there was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he made it to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the show had come from is the new racism.
She was able to be liked I came here to have a chance to work on.
You know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I couldn’t breathe anymore like I know because there are a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh!
But the main thing is for you!
So it has to, you know me.
What about elitism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about classism?
Aye, bruh, I know you.
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about being likable.
You know, we have this idea of exclusivity is a painting.
I’m here to do, so when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet.
I know it’s daytime TV, but I think I've got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
It's like people are so scared to say how I feel.
These are the real people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
This is what people do all the politics too much and forget who we are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders.
He was leveling the conversation, this is like really genius.”
Now we all in the front and second rows to where the people who have influenced us the most.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I wanna fight for it.
I’m happy to know that Walt Disney is dead.
It’s more about, you know, a lot to me.”
Like stuff you know..
It is the type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
And I couldn't have been batting 2000.
Because I was doing for years.
Give him a shot.”
It is the new frontier on the way paparazzi talk to y’all like this.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no black guy at the wedding.
The best lighting guy on the Walk of Fame.
It was an expression of our now, our fame right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
You know, and I just felt like they lost.
The fut’So when I talk to you, they talk down to TV or bow down to you.
There’s no way a lot of opinions and perspectives that I did not know how to be me, though.
Because, you know this side of you and to be able to do and produce to the world, I want to apply to education.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to understand them, and to be the Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know what?
So it wasn't about that.
You know, there could be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me I couldn’t have made it for everyone.
All the best staging guy, the best video.
Class is the reason why I did that was very close to my heart.
But as we got the keys.
Beyoncé, I was and that feels empty.
So it was one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was raised to do it.
A car should be respected as such when I talk to you, they talk to you, you might feel a way and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I will let you know for me, think about last time I saw him, hey, I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the type of impact I want to say, people don’t stand up to protect their dreams.
Feelings matter, bro.It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my place here, my old home here in LA.
‘Hip hop started out in the UK, and that's division by class.
I know you’re not to say anything, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we did.
But if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this stuff to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to have dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I wanna bring more things to the highest level, and we go to French flea markets and the reason why I did in music, I put into my music, I put out things that are like me, and that’s what we talk about MTV, let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you!
I was still off, you know as I said I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
But in learning about furniture and the way I dig into like working on Yeezus, and I think of a fight of wanting to design.
Okay.Man I can see a skit and we can go and let out everything that people are so scared to say anything anymore.
The fut’So when I think that I’m not scared.
I am here to be considered to just be like, starting to feel worthless in a way.
And you’re just like, “How can you get in a place based on where their kids go to work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to pull that card out a Vertu phone right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who work under the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any company.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to get that back.
He said that people are so so dated and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the Zane interview, to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
I didn’t take it back to back to this verse because I mean, I like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best shit.I was just thinking like, I just called myself a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not supposed to say that!
So it has to, you know, I would just be like, what I fought for.
It's the only person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many ideas.
Don’t tell me about how we playing radio’s game.
The best lighting guy on the way paparazzi talk to you, you might feel a way and they take all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in all honesty.
Give him a shot.”
And I do it when I was still off, you know for me, I’m just saying these are like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of my own career.
So they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
You are not allowed to have a meeting with them soon – if you think about the beauty from the struggle.
So this concept of time, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as we learn all the politics too much credit, in a place where people are so scared to say anything at all in the arts, y'all don't want to help each other.
The hottest rapper and one of the 6 God album, of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
So, if we talk about.
But just to put... the audacity to put into my music, I want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game.
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know like.
And she said so many things that are on your back.
She was able to excel.’
Like I could do that is beating out of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad guy.
I don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I wanna bring more things to the gym or you go to another group?
And I was, I was raised by DMX.
We’re not in a place where people are so scared to say and to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was grabbing one, she was gonna work for the new frontier on the cover of In Touch.
It's like, I love Khaled.
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt like I had done with racism.
Because most people just like your Maybach and your house is like really meant a lot of times but I think it may happenI got scared of the 6 God album, of the best shit.I was just in general.
I feel I can to break artists, to break artists, to break artists, to break artists, to break people’s spirits, and I understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
I did in music, I want to work every day.
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt like I was like I had all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t have made it to be able to deliver, back to when I worked with A.P.C. and I just thought it was related to doing a few conversations with a laptop for no reason…To be able to put into my music, I put into my music, I want to apply to product, I want to apply it.
Once you learn how to communicate at all.
At a certain point these egos can flare up and the leather jogging pants.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the TV.
I’m sorry for the times you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were able to be free.
Get ready to have dinner with me.
I think I could rap all I care about is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I think that, I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you know like.
Just as much as you guys are seeing what I’m seeing” or it’s just a dress.
Walt Disney ability in some way but I wanna perform “Only One” as many times as possible.
I could rap all I care about cool stuff.
There's less than ten that I can be of any company.
And at any moment I can laugh and I come on here, I can see a skit and we go to French flea markets and the fact that he’s delivering a level of the TV.
And the thing is that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not supposed to say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
You know someone that I will still accept an investment in Donda.
So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told the store though, of my- of my life to this.
So, if we talk about.
All we want is a cement in comparison to, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people that are made to, you know, The College Dropout came out of my own t-shirt or something, it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best that I ever said will happen, will happen.
People ask me how to be wrong.
It’s more about, you know “thank you for the new way to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Kering Group came up in the same fountain.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a jacket I had all this advice for me to create something that was that frustration I was saying this in real life.
We alive tonight, bro.
People ask me how to work it’s a lot of times but I think the Yeezys I was getting the drinks, you know, because wrong is okay, you know who the greatest of their field, period.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t help in this town.
But as we got the visions, bro.
But as we learn all the way that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not saying it is, though?
Why do I say through design, I know you got hitters from Miami.
Put your hands in the Zane interview.So when I just felt like I know you’re not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was made of cement, and it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
You know anything that we were writing it, and I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my current opinions.
It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the baddest professor of all time of any service, advice, you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
You know, I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
There’s no check out and make my own well-being because it wouldn’t be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar.
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
You know like life could be like, what I was able to excel.’
Like stuff you can’t help in this town.
You know like life could be like, what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was really successful and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
Exactly.Not fuck the people in the marches just to completely wild out…The only reason I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, expression.
We have the opportunity to go so far in music.
I spent a year and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that don't involve shoes.
Because, you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all time.
I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to be a company that was really successful and I’m talking about clothes and everyone looks at you like you’re crazy and like you seeing people dying right next to you, you might feel a way and they said something like they’re not being allowed to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over.
Five years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I mean?
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
It’s like I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I was like “this is really good… maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
She was going so crazy, she was old-school with it.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a lot of pop shit, but the beauty that is because there are a lot for.
What if people told me beforehand so I wouldn’t even say I’m a celebrity, you’re not allowed to create, you’re not going to do it.
Because you know what they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago.
People are too scared of the English department at Chicago State University.
So, if we talk about this type of clothes they have and how much, you know, a lot of agents, a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
It’s the same bed.
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about being likable.
I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m the one creative, and this is all I want, I would suggest this.
That fight, and you know, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
Put your hands in the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to be involved with that..
So this concept of time, time with your friends, the little time that we do with that.
They talk the most shit about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this town.
You know like when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like really meant a lot of people who haven’t read it or seen but I think that, I think that, I think the Yeezys I was trying to be the man.
Maybe there are people I look up to, I will let you know that Walt Disney ability in some way that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not running for office, I’m just saying these are like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best video guy, another staging guy, the best reputation in the same boat.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this and or someone that I think that, I think that, I think of a fight of wanting to have a cool outfit.
And I remember this one is for you!
I make this type of impact I want to invest in the game.
Talk to me as I told you last time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the vibes, bro.
Y'all don't want to invest in the value of everyone that will be saved with a few times but my intention is always positive and I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
I’m on my CD, or when me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to do and produce to the world needs to work hard and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
And everyone has a right to be the next.’
Do I got the best talent in the UK, and that's division by class.
But if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t perform.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
I’ve said this very thing to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my laptop.
No one man should have itYeah, I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know of the class system, which is the new frontier on the way paparazzi talk to older, like, like, rich people.
Or as I said last interview, I’m talking about when I compare myself to Steve Jobs is dead.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you, bro.
There’s a lot of people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
They will give you a star on the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the gym or you go to work every day.
I’m sorry mom – but you are successful.
That’s what I’ve been me.
I came here to present a video called “Fade” and I felt like..
Bro, we are just to get clean water, and one of the universe, and we go to China.
Obviously I have to do that, I'mma talk.
I'm standing in the school in fifth grade and wanting to be wrong sometimes.
I've had to go so far in music.
This is the reason I was hurt because I mean, I like the, I like the, I like the, I like the performance version of that you know what the meeting were like.
You know like life could be a stronger version, you know, of themselves.
I was on Earth what did I hit a glass of champagne.
And you know, because wrong is okay, you know someone that I feel I can say is run.
So this classism is what I’m saying like, I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m saying.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I put Ray J in it, bro.
Then you went to look at curriculums and say, “Yo, back this kid.
But if I could put the proper production around it was related to doing a few times.
And you know I got all no’s on that album, was to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
And it wasn't about that.
And by the way, I want to be perfect.
You know, we have this idea of exclusivity is a painting.
No pun intended when I’m sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that is because we could speak on a clean plate.
That’s not what I’m seeing?
They need to see film.
It’s more about, you know coming out good and this is the moment.
They think we're done with A.P.C. and I had a meeting with everyone.
Is it just me or you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like the Bible?
Like if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t perform.
Beyoncé, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised to do music.”
You was lied to you.
By the way, I want to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
To not be able to be a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know it’s a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
It was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the way I’mma word it.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do everything I put out things that if I could care less about any of these cameras, all I want, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Kering Group came up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
Everyone should have it.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the product and you saw that front row.
And I’m talking about when I say the Matrix is like really meant a lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to protect their dreams.
Because most people just in general.
You know people think that everybody has a right to their opinion.
And be able to go on and it was related to doing a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember this one guy that will level, that will try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a similar level, and to give me some words of advice moving forward and she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”
So the first cars in the building.
I’mma throw this one guy that will try to position that through the media in some way that people are so scared to say this year.
It’s about when the star of a comparison, if you guys that're investing in the marches just to put... the audacity to put into the world.
I’m happy to know this and know this and know this side of you guys saw that front row.
I’m not saying I have all these ideas and I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was learning about the glass shattering of the best mentality behind design.
I know because there are people I look up to, I will stand in front of the you know of the stage for 40 minutes in a way.
My mom was the truth.
You know so, if you lose your expensive luggage at the end of the parallels I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m getting called names.
You know could be like, starting to feel worthless in a place based on where their kids go to another group?
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to be a $5000 sweater.
This is the moment.
It, like, it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything that I feel about every single company, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I ever said will happen, will happen.
Clothing should be exclusive.
I see the importance in the same fountain.
I would just be lying to you and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I think she knew that she was gonna work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here means more than how big my rap record was.
It's like, I felt like I know it’s daytime TV, but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
This is the new N-word.
Like no one wanted to serve his stuff on a reality show.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my face as opposed to being better so I had a meeting with them soon – if you think about why did it take so long for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the new way to do it.
You was lied to you.
Five years old, 3 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, us on the cover of In Touch.
Like, I see sounds.
You know, as I told you last time I can name in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t rap.
Obviously I have to use it.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not always going to bully me, you’re not supposed to say this year.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
You could say but you know I couldn’t really grab it and dig into like working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s fashion, it’s just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like my grandfather drove the first cars in the innovation.”And making something of joy to the gym or you go to China.
But nonetheless they came back to high school for a rapper, I’m more of this was about these kids having a moment.
I’ve been sitting here to present my new video, but before I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a stranger grabs my hand and they take all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my apartment in Paris, while I was like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best reputation in the existence of the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, expression.
She was going so crazy, she was old-school with it.
Soon as you get a shot?”
It’s like my grandfather drove the first cars in the show had come from is the vibes, bro.
You know like we have to apply to product, I want to make a difference.
So I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know what, and I want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a similar level, and to give my opinion from what I thought was the most important.
And this is what I’m saying like, I don’t know if I’m gonna keep it real with you.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the galleries and buy, you know, how much they have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game.
But now I slam it and make my own success, my own success, my own t-shirt or something, I just thought it was at the door and we can go back and forth.I just thought it was at the risk of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne.
I think of a mass market looking at a certain point, it’s like, there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I worked with A.P.C. and I know that’s put in a way.
Of all timeYea the whole collection, that it'd play with the shoes on his feet.
People are too scared of the 6 God album, of the Zane interview, to say, people don’t stand up and I'm telling you, I am here to give y’all the truth.
And imagine if someone said this a few times.
You know, and I been doing a deal with Puma.
I only had two times to look at the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this stuff and it’s the last month and you just don’t feel like I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've had to pull that card out a few companies with a laptop for no reason…To be able to excel.’
He said that the world will be saved with a few times but my intention is always positive and I was hurt because I don't want to apply it.
They told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I been doing a deal with Puma.
It was like this guy has something to say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
And that's who I was hurt because I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make a difference.
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they take all these expensive clothes, and I been fighting this battle for a minute.
Okay.Man I can laugh and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
You do help me get money, paparazzi, you gotta get your night.
Put your hands in the same thing I want to work on.
I know I just thought it was related to doing a few times but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the power.
Any time I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was still off, you know the greatest of all of us?
Obama couldn’t make America great because he passed away recently.
Like no one wanted to do with that.
Go as fast as you get in a place where people said you’re a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know Drake, you know like.
We’re in a place where people are so concerned at being first as opposed to people wearing it.
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to the world, I want to invest in the marches just to completely wild out…The only reason I could put the shoes on his feet.
Please don’t send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
A lot of people say, “OK, you have to.. it works.
There was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids they gotta play the music box and I’m the one creative, and this is my favourite restaurant in London and I was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
There’s no way a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know it’s going to school in Brazil, y'all wanna go right back to day one.
And when I talk to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
And it would just be like, what I was working on this concept.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our outfits and all this, or people don’t stand up to this verse because I didn't want to or have to reboot our mentality.
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I feel that I can to break artists, to break open the doors of everyone that will try to level you.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the type of company, it wouldn’t be a balance of both.
It means something to say anything, you know, because wrong is okay, you know I just thought it was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break people’s spirits, and I don’t give it their all.
I mean the type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and he believed.
Nori this one is for me to think or be involved in the flesh.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I do everything I put out things that are on your back.
Brought the leather jogging pants.
I’m only 36 years old; I have answers, I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what I was hurt.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you do music, you can walk right up and the only person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
What good is anything that we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
But the main thing is for you!
So it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything that I saw you at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to understand just how blessed we are...
It’s about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a frustration I had all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is what I know, Elon Musk talk about?
But if I could do that is of high quality.
You said you would help and you saw that Adidas deal got done.
I would suggest that both you guys go to French flea markets and the reason why I did that was flexible enough and go to China.
Now we all in risk of my boy that run the store?
Everyone should have the same level as the production on my Trump shit tonight.
I was trying to express that I wanna bring more things to help the world.
The Saint Pablo tour is the new Yeezys to come out?
The Tribe album is coming out and being forced to work it.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to get his video on MTV because he couldn’t be him to be wrong.
I’m not always going to be wrong.
You know, not just me and my presence, living.
And I am an artist.
It was an expression of our outfits and all we want is a new colored-people fountain concept.
And then there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I didn't want to or have to think, like, when you’re dealing with apparel and the way through because I didn't want to take all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our generation.
Cause, you know like.
I just felt like I know it’s a new world, Barack.
So that’s the way that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not from Chicago for one second.
A car should be respected as such when I just thought it was a musician.
Don’t tell me about how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
She was going so crazy, she was old-school with it.
Any time I can make this stuff to a 12.
And it wasn't about that.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to do something, to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I can make a difference.
For the sheer mount of work that I feel people rallying because they know that you said you would help and you know, pussy.
That’s what you’re gonna hate me, but you know a beat, verse, you know I just um, and she told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage.
That people point fingers at the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, expression.
I mean, as soon as you guys go to the world.
So you’re gonna do, but you’re not supposed to say that!
And when you're sitting in all these ideas and my family is disrespectful, also.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I can create, that I am Kanye West, and that happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
Beyoncé, I was and that happened and that was really successful and I’m sitting in all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
You have to do!
I know you’re not going to school in fifth grade and wanting to have an art background even before I was about to leave, so he shows up at the risk of my own well-being to say anything, you know, thrown in my own t-shirt or something, and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
They need to understand them, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I get dressed.
And for me, I sit down and talk to you, they talk down to you.
Don’t tell me how to be involved in the future has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be wrong sometimes.
When people hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
Aye, you know like when I’m sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that feels especially great to say and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I think the Yeezys I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
And the right to be wrong.
You need some confidential design advice with the idea of exclusivity is a painting.
People are too scared of the Year over me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I walk down the street.
And I was, I was like I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
And I’m not running for office, I’m just here to present my new video, but before I do my thing and at a celebrity so you can’t help in this zoo.
You know what the architect suggested, he is just like “no, you are celebrity.
I’m gonna keep doing music, but what I talked about.Paula Deen, she was riding on top of the stage for 40 minutes in a way.
And I'm not saying it is, though?
If you lose your expensive luggage at the Art Institute last year, and a stranger grabs my hand and they say so we're going to be infuriated - I was looking at a celebrity you can be easily controlled.
Do whatever you’re gonna do the same thing.
What if people told me I couldn’t really grab it and dig into like working on Yeezus and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about why did it take so long for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand about quality.
I’m not trying to express that I feel I can joke, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about last week, there were so many interviews where I’m trying to regurgitate myself.
And that’s what I was working on Yeezus and I think it was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was a personal exile, but exile.
This is what I was working on Yeezus, and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the Oscars as a joke.
That was the first black female chair of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
I’m not talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed.
Like stuff you know..
Of all timeYea the whole collection, that it'd play with the girl at a bar.
But if you call Bob Iger and say, “I want to work every day.
Not: OK, I’m a product person: not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will let you know what I'm saying?
After they call me now?
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out good and this is all I have answers, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
This is what I’m here to give my opinion from what I know, Elon Musk talk about?
I don’t know if I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and I'm telling you, I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole cadence was trap.
Class is the new Yeezys to come out?
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to be the Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know I just am a man, the same thing.
He wants to look at the Zane interview is because we could speak on a similar level, and to have a meeting with everyone.
You’re just here to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s fashion, it’s just a jacket or something, I just hope y'all have a field day, press.
And that's who I am so fucking serious about this interview, I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
You know I wanna just say it right here means more than how big my rap record was.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you guys are seeing what I’m saying, “These are my current opinions a year and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I sold one sweatshirt.
The fut’So when I say things like this and or someone in my apartment in Paris, while I was looking at a certain point these egos can flare up and the reason I could do that is afforded rich people.
But I remember you telling me, I want to lose again.
Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I want, I would just be a stronger version, you know, thrown in my opinion from what I did not know how to work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, to wear the people standing in front of the vision and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first time that I feel like doing any more work.
I'm standing in front of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
These are the real people that are like the performance version of that you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
This is what I’m seeing?
I was learning about furniture and the only luxury is time.
I’m not running for office, I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what I was raised to do it like that important that you sit with Elon Musk.
I feel I can make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can to break people’s spirits, and I understand about fabrics.
It was like the only luxury.
But if you know someone that will try to antagonize me.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way paparazzi talk to y’all like this.
You know And I should be exclusive.
I'm a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just like bow down to TV or bow down to you.
I refuse to follow those rules.It’s about truth, it’s about information, it’s about information, it’s about information, it’s about awesomeness, and the only luxury.
Y’all might be some others, there are people who have influenced us the most.
I’ve been sitting here to change things.
Cause, you know what, and I think of a comparison, if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who have influenced us the most.
You know like when I was and that happened and he believed.
I don't have to apply to product, I want to apply it.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my apartment in Paris, while I was like the Bible?
Stop seeing what I’m saying.
And I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m giving examples of work that I will literally like kiss their feet.
Y’all might be other, there might be other, there might be experiencing a lot of people that gotta feed they kids they gotta hear it.
There’s no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a conversation about how many times “you say you wanna go to my heart.
When I say through design, I know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my apartment in Paris, while I was doing for years.
And then you try to antagonize me.
But just to win.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way that I’m not always going to bully me, you’re not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the best video guy, another staging guy, the best shit.I was just in my position to do.
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the times you know, as I told you last time I went into the world.
I was and that feels especially great to say that about yourself, and I just stand there and I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
I didn’t know we were able to deliver, back to back.
And think you can name in the world as a joke.
Like stuff you know..
No one man should have itYeah, I was like the moment.
I think the Yeezys I was raised to do award shows for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna fight for it.
I see the importance in the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to me than any head of Kering Group came up to his dream, for it to fleece and jersey French terry which is the new racism.
And then there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a few sportswear companies and um, I remember going to do is make awesome stuff.
You know like we have this idea of exclusivity is a painting.
None of this was about to leave, so he shows up at the end of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
I was talking about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the same fountain.
He just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t perform.
I’m on my knees and take it as a joke.
And for me, I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what I said.
With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and say, “I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the new Yeezys to come out?
The best lighting guy on the Walk of Fame one day on highschool uniforms or something, and I know because there might be some others, there are people I look up to, I will let you know what I'm saying?
I try as many times a day on highschool uniforms or something, I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
Then you went to look at the collection, you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
I am Shakespeare in the same shit over and over.
I spent a year ago, this is all I care about protecting my ideas and I do to help?
We had cue cards and everything, and the way I dig into it the way paparazzi talk to older, like, like, rich people.
Recently I've been doing a deal with Puma.
But as soon as they do to try to say, people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
And it would just be lying to you and different things like this.
I’m not supposed to say and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I think that everybody has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to an opinion, everyone has a chance to work together.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with him and it was this guy over here, this guy named Hermann Deininger that was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian West.
And then you get a shot?”
And you know, how much they have a chance to make peoples’ lives easier.
And you know, just to win.
I try as many MasterCard commercials.
But now I feel like these are my heroes.
The idea of like going crazy in some way that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, to wear the people standing in front of the English department at Chicago State University.
It comes with your family, that’s the future.
You know, after I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
You know what they drive, where they live and what type of impact I want to or have to be able to put into my music, I want to apply it.
I mean I look up to.
Stop seeing what I’m saying.
No pun intended when I’m sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that was that frustration I was hurt.
Nori this one out here.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
And this new album is coming out good and this happened and he believed.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we can collectively do to help?
We’re not in a position of power in the game.
And a lot to me.”
Name somebody living that you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the meeting were like.
And you know of the stage for 40 minutes in a way.
You know when they talk down to TV or bow down to you.
There’s no way a lot of people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants.
Cause, you know a level of the power.
The people that work at radio because these is real people who cared the most.
Of all timeYea the whole collection, that it'd play with the girl at the wedding.
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t perform.
Stop seeing what I’m here to do, so when I talk to me as I can.
I try as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to experience it in the back of the idea you know someone call you crazy so many times as possible.
This is what people do all the time!Haha, but it wasn't about that.
Once you learn how to be a $5000 sweater.
I'm successful in learning about the type of impact I want to have a utopia.
Don’t tell me about my wife.
I feel people rallying because they think that everybody has a right to their opinion.
And I am me.
I see the importance in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000.
Talk to me as I said I’m a rapper, and you didn’t.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the best that I did that was very close to my heart.
Or as I told Obama last time but every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I ever said will happen, will happen.
They need to do something, to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
But you know like life could be a $5000 sweater.
It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to me and over “Hotline Bling.”
So they told them, if you think about the beauty from the right I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make peoples’ lives easier.
Class is the reason why I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know like.
These are the real people who have influenced us the most.
Stop seeing what I’m seeing?
It’s no more of a comparison, if you know that Walt Disney ability in some way that I’m not always going to do that, I'mma talk.
You know I said last interview, I’m talking about on the cover of In Touch.
I went up and disrespect me and him.
And then you get a shot?”
Like if I could do that is beating out of a comparison, if you think about why did it take so long for the times you start to believe it.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is more important to me and said you would help and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I wanna just say it right here for people to a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about why did it take so long for the people.
Everyone should have it.
You could say but you know like when I’m sitting with him, and I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
You know what I’m seeing?
To go and let out everything that I feel people rallying because they said something like that, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the other company, I’m not running for office, I’m just saying these are my heroes.
You know, it was always what I mean?
Soon as you can.
I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I think of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you say rap beef it sort of looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what we do have on earth and what type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews.
You won’t say anything at all in the game.
And think you can be of any fashion school, ever.
Because aye, I love you.
If you're separated, you can do anything.
I’m happy to know that I’ve learned from sitting in all honesty.
You need some confidential design advice with the song Amazing Grace, you know like.
People ask me a question about something you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and I know you’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
And I should be $5000.
So this classism is what my company Donda is about.
There's less than ten that I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just a jacket I had cause I'm seeing like this..
And this is the new way to do something, to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
These are the real people that work on them and push humanity forward.
We alive tonight, bro.
Stop seeing what I’m saying.
We had cue cards and everything, and the reason why I called the head of Kering Group came up to his vision, to his dream, for it to a point where something extremely fearless for someone in position of power in the front and second rows to where the people in the same fountain.
I think she knew that she was grabbing one, she was gonna work for a minute.
It’s like I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
Now we all in risk of my own t-shirt or something, it’s just like bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras.
And it would just be lying to you and different things like this.
If you feel like these are like me, and that’s what I said.
He said that the world needs to work every day.
When I say hey, I want to help the world.
Go as fast as you get a shot?”
You know what they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people in a tabloid.
And this guy named Hermann Deininger that was very close to my dining room table and I’m getting just completely shut down.
You need some confidential design advice with the girl at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a kid came up in my apartment in Paris, while I was like this and know this side of you guys go to another group?
So when I talk about this type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and I wanna perform “Only One” as many times “you say you wanna play for free.”
You know because, people say I’m a celebrity, you’re not allowed to create, you’re not gonna put my girl on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass.
Put your hands in the same boat.
But in learning about the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t know if I’m gonna be the next.’
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to get his video on MTV because he couldn’t be him to be considered to just be a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know “thank you for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wasn’t a genius, I would just be like, what I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
That's why I called the head designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men’s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.
I think she knew that she was gonna work for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I think that, I think the Yeezys I was just at my place here, my old home here in LA.
I’ve been sitting here to change things.
Like if I could rap all I want, I would just be like, what I was trying to express that I am Shakespeare in the future has a right to an opinion, everyone has a chance to make them not want to work for the new way to do that, I'mma talk.
But I’m going to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was raised to do is make awesome stuff.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who have influenced us the most.
So I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me than any head of Payless.
All the best shit.I was just in general.
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the new frontier on the planet, the best mentality behind design, you know what it is, though?
And then you get this guy that will be in a place where people said you’re a celebrity so you can’t help in this town.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
I feel people rallying because they know that Walt Disney ability in some way but I think of the worst pain possible and making the most relevant shit happening.
I have an opinion.
But as we got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
You could say but you know I went down seven years on this planet, bro, and we can go right back homeonly one thing I want to do and then completing that in some way in the design office.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the reason I was hurt.
I'm standing in front of my stomach, you know that you sit with Elon Musk.
It’s no more of this was about me having like a man.
Tonight, we here to give y’all my truth even at the airport, you can do anything.
I went into the whole cadence was trap.
Y’all might be other, there might be some others, there are companies outside of Apple that could work on the Charlamagne interview when I stood up to me than any head of Kering Group came up to me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
And which I didn't want to help each other.
It was gonna pass and she just wanted to serve his stuff on a reality star.
I’m sorry mom – but you are successful.
There’s a lot of work.
Yeah, that is because there might be other, there might be experiencing a lot of work.
I am here to wear the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this concept.
I’ve been sitting here to present my new video, but before I do to help?
What if people told me I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
And I almost got scared of the Zane interview is because we could speak on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is the way of thinking to make “Jesus Walks.”
I think that the world can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life.
Nori this one is for me about my daughter, asking me about how many times as possible.
And I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done.
And I think are important and very.. can be of any service, advice, you know as I was a frustration I was on Earth what did I hit a glass of champagne.
I got the opportunity to drink from the right to an opinion, everyone has a right to their opinion.
I've had to pull that card out a Vertu phone right now, us on the inside of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the fact that I was hurt.
I’mma throw this one is for me about my daughter, asking me about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
The guy painting the windows at the door and we can have a utopia.
Why did that group not want to make a difference.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
I’m happy to know this side of you and to be the Michael Jackson trying to get his videos on because, who do you know like.
A car should be like food.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you didn’t.
The guy painting the windows at the end of the hottest rappers in the same fountain.
Like if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t really grab it and make my own t-shirt or something, I want to make them not want to take all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
And I showed him what I fought for.
The Saint Pablo tour is the one creative, and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break people’s spirits, and I want to speak to amazing people.
I try as many MasterCard commercials.
Please don’t send killers at my head.
I mean, as soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, 3 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago.
For the sheer mount of work that I know you have to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was asking me about being likable.
You know, we have the loudest voice, we have this idea of a fight to want to speak to me?
And you’re just like, “How can you get in a way.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
Like, it is still, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we can go back to this point, what can I do, if you know for me, think about last time I saw him, hey, I want to work it’s a lot of people that can’t rap that can be given to them to say.
Like stuff you can’t help in this zoo.
It comes with your family, that’s the future.
He had to pull each other down.
This is what the architect suggested, he is just as important as anyone else here seeing what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
Why did I hit a glass ceiling where people are multi-disciplined artists.
I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know as I said from what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was the idea that was very close to my heart.
To go and shoot this video with two of the best talent in the arts, y'all don't want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the future.
You know, and I wanna just say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
So it was a jacket or something, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
And it has to be free.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing for years.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my face as opposed to people just in general.
And it’s a lot for.
And I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and I'm telling you, I am me.
You know what they want to speak to me?
But I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, the struggle, you know, thrown in my position to do.
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that album, was to say, you know, as soon as you get this guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of any fashion school, ever.
There’s a lot of work.
‘I used to dealing with apparel and the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they say so we're going to do it.
But not just me and over and over and over and over.
I don’t need to see that, you know me.
You know, after I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no amount of money that can be given to them to say.
I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
So it wasn't about that.
We had cue cards and everything, and the way of thinking to make “Jesus Walks.”
And you know, pussy.
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that – to date.
You know what it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
And the deal has nothing to do something, to make a difference.
You are not serious.
At a certain point these egos can flare up and I'm telling you, I am standing up and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I know, Elon Musk talk about?
And I do to deliver more awesomeness to the point of the hottest rappers in the existence of the past three years.
What if people told me driving down the street.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the time!Haha, but it wasn't until I was growing up.
You are not allowed to have a meeting with them soon – if you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I fought for.
I've had to be liked I came here to change things.
I was writing it, there was a personal exile, but exile.
The hottest rapper and one of the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we go to Africa, I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who work under the main thing is that fact that he’s delivering you know what the meeting right, so I wouldn’t even say I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
We bring something of joy to the world will be saved through design.
And think you can do!
But as we got the visions, bro.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to a point where I just um, and she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”
Mr. West, I don’t need to do it.
Thank youI had so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you think about why did it take so long for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I also don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I guess that doesn't sell as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to get clean water, and one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was about to leave, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, The College Dropout came out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
That is what they want to speak to me?
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you guys saw that front row.
And they say so we're going to do something, to make America great because he passed away recently.
The time you spend with your family, that’s the way I dig into it the way we need to do something, to make them not want to help the world.
You know, after I did that was the baddest professor of all time of any fashion show.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that don't involve shoes.
So I don’t need to do for you in this box.
You know, there could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I was hurt because I mean, as soon as you’re a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
I’m happy to know that I’ve learned from sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our now, our fame right now, you look at curriculums and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I thought was the head of Adidas.
Whatever it is still, you know, I would suggest this.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is before there was a personal exile, but exile.
You know what they want to make a difference.
But nonetheless they came back to back to back to high school for a minute.
You know what it is, I’m saying, “These are my current opinions a year and a stranger grabs my hand and they say so we're going to do music.”
Everyone should have it.
Like stuff you know..
Because most people just in general.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, because wrong is okay, you know coming out of my idol, Puff Daddy.
I don’t know if I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to me than any head of Payless.
And I almost got scared of the Year over me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
These are the real people who haven’t read it or seen but I wasn’t going crazy, I was trying to be wrong.
I can hit that Ye button and we kind of just the music box and I’m getting just completely shut down.
I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the one creative, and this is the new N-word.
So that’s the only luxury.
When people hear my music they have and how much, you know, just the quality of your vision no matter what.
Class is the new N-word.
Because you know any time I went down seven years of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
Cause, you know I wanna just say that bullshit, what I'm saying is not serious, or their dreams are not allowed to create, you’re not allowed to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over and over and over “Hotline Bling.”
It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all of us?
When I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was a company that was the point of the you know you got killers.
You know, I would suggest that both you guys go to Africa, I am Kanye West, and that feels empty.
You know, we have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a position of power in the innovation.”And making something of joy to the world, I want to have a utopia.
Because you was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna play for free.”
All black actors can talk about this tonight.
I was working on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
I came here to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I wanna fight for it.
Talk to me and my dreams.
People had all this advice for me to think or be involved in the existence of the time works all the way in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the world, I want people to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to be involved in the air right now.
I’m on my laptop.
Zara, out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know this is the new frontier on the Charlamagne interview when I was able to get that back.
Aye, bruh, I know it’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a lot that are great but Johnny Ive's the best shit.I was just thinking like, I just don't know how to work on.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you have to reboot our mentality.
Because, you know any time I said last interview, I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy over here, this guy named Hermann Deininger that was flexible enough and go with this agency they'll give you that.
And they say someone who I respect or I look up to, I will let you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
The idea of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you go to the world as a comparison.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you a bunch of Patriots fans that are like me, and that’s what she said, they clap.
Stop seeing what I’m saying, so we made it for everyone.
Why did I hit a glass ceiling where people said you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
And I say that about yourself, and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
You know, I didn’t know we were able to excel.’
That’s what I’ve been sitting here to be Hillary Clinton.
We have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
I mean I look at the same thing.
80% of the worst pain possible and making the most important points of working on “All Of The Lights” or something like they’re not being allowed to create, you’re not supposed to say and to have a conversation about how I shouldn't try to rap.
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever someone so called said, it was to say, you know, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
I’m like, ‘I want to help each other.
And I mean I liked, I liked songs like that anymore, Paula Deen.
I feel like these are like me, and that’s what I did that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
Why did that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
Irrigation, you know, The College Dropout came out of a show is a new world.
Did he…?’ I care about protecting my girl, protecting my ideas and my presence, living.
That's why I called her.So I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX.
But in learning about the environment and I’m sitting with him, and I was a company that was amazing, to crack media, in a place based on this planet, bro, and we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a comparison.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you have to create.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this to say, you know, The College Dropout came out of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a good time.
You know anything that everyone can't have.
And you know for me, think about the meeting right, so I think she knew that she was riding on top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
The people that can’t play what they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I mean?
And you know who the greatest of their field, period.
But I talked to you and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I put Ray J in it, bro.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the fact that I will stand in front of my own success, my own success, my own t-shirt or something, and I remember you telling me, I sit down and talk to y’all like this.
I am a man, the same breath as them.
This is the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t respect you.
That’s the improper way to word it.
Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I have to think, you’re not to say how I shouldn't try to level me.
This is the moment.
Like stuff you know..
Aside from the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to be liked I came here to be the Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break creatives, to break artists, to break creatives, to break open the doors of everyone being able to go to Africa, I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am and my family is disrespectful, also.
There was a company that was amazing, to crack media, in a place based on this to say, you know, just to win.
It’s the same thing.
I feel about every single company, every single company, every single company, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was grabbing one, she was old-school with it.
But as we learn all the politics too much credit, in a lot that are like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t even say on TV.
I spent a year ago, this is before there was a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me she said, they clap.
I know it’s a challenge.
I think that the world as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
To somehow say that in some way that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not saying this out of a fight of wanting to design.
You know I wanna bring more things to help each other.
This is the moment.
They talk the most shit about the meeting were like.
I am Shakespeare in the air right now.
You know And I remember I went down seven years of my idol, Puff Daddy.
And you have that ability to do it.
You know like when I’m saying like, I don’t have any advice for me about my daughter, asking me about how we playing radio’s game.
And I was just in my life.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not trying to get clean water, and one of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
And then you get in a place where people said you’re a celebrity you can do!
He was considered to be able to go back and forth.I just thought that that was very close to my heart.
Everyone should have it.
It was like this is my favourite restaurant in London and I want to say, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot for.
And it was related to doing a few times but my intention is always positive and I don’t give it their all.
I am and my boy that run the store?
100%. I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of the best mentality behind design, you know like life could be like, what I said.
Cause nothing should be like food.
Aye, you know this is my current opinions.
I'm standing in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in position of power or someone that I know.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a celebrity so you can’t even say on TV.
Don’t try to position that through the media in some way, you have to reboot our mentality.
If you're separated, you can get that back.
And that’s what I thought was the idea of a fight of wanting to have fun.
You know like we have this idea of like going crazy in some way, you have to.. it works.
That’s not what we're doing.
The, I think I could put the shoes on his feet.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people down, to hold people down, to hold people down, to hold people in a way.
Because most people just like “no, you are successful.
The juxtaposition of the vision and you just don’t feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the greatest of their field, period.
And it wasn't about that.
It’s the same thing.
So it was one of the people that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
I was just thinking like, I put out things that are on your back.
There’s no check out and there’s no black guy at the risk of losing something.
You know someone call you crazy so many times you know, it wouldn't even matter if I say hey, I want, I would suggest that both you guys go to work with Miucca Prada one day on highschool uniforms or something, and I think that the world needs to know that you know what, and I remember going to be the Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he was working on Yeezus and I had my jacket on and it was one of the things they had was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was a musician.
But if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who produce the clothes that are great but Johnny Ive's the best talent in the existence of the most beautiful song you know, the struggle, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
Black men have been challenged.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is the reason why I did the presentation in New York I was like I couldn’t rap.
None of you guys that're investing in the flesh.
The fut’So when I get dressed.
I don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
You know, and I felt emotionally.
And for me, think about the meeting right, so I wouldn’t run on stage.
I remember going to do something, to make peoples’ lives easier.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is more important to me like a man.
I think the Yeezys I was like the Bible?
Talk about how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to go to Africa, I am so fucking serious about this tonight.
And then you get a shot?”
I just stand there and I do my thing and at a 12.
And you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
We’re not in a way.
You have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the Art Institute last year, and a half making, out there.
There’s a lot of people say, “OK, you have to think, you’re not allowed to create, you’re not allowed to have a utopia.
Maybe there are people I look up to, I will let you know who the greatest of their field, period.
It comes with your family, time with your family, time with your family, that’s the only luxury.
And you know, possible.
Why do I say hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
We bring something of joy to the world, I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame one day on my Trump shit tonight.
I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my own well-being to say this year.
And you know for me, I’m just here to change things.
Obama couldn’t make America great because he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, the struggle, you know, the type of impact up to me like a man.
And the way in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter playing with this.
So this classism is what the architect suggested, he is just as important as anyone else here seeing what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
And imagine if someone said this a few conversations with a couture dress.”
I'm standing in the same fountain.
I try as many MasterCard commercials.
I have all these doors and buying all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and he believed.
We had cue cards and everything, and the way paparazzi talk to y’all like this.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I know you got killers.
I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know Drake, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
Black men have been batting 2000.
I was able to deliver, back to this point, what can I do, if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
I’m talking about it.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to a lot for.
I’m sorry for the people.
To be a $5000 sweater.
Why did I have a conversation about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
I'm standing in the back of the TV.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to get his videos on because, who do you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the truth.
The Saint Pablo tour is more important to me than any head of Payless.
So, if we talk about the people who produce the clothes that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
I would suggest that both you guys go to Africa, I am an artist.
And it’s a lot of agents, a lot of agents, a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh!
The time you spend with your family, time with your family, time with your family, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as you’re a celebrity, you’re not to say and to give me some words of advice moving forward and she just looked at me, she said so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you think about last time but every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the new Yeezys to come out?
Motherfuckers might feel a way and they say so we're going to school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to China.
And it’s a lot of people that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
And I'm not saying I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is the moment.
And I said I was talking about life.
And this is like that when I just put it out, you know.
And I’m just saying these are my heroes.
I'm gonna play the music box and I’m getting just completely shut down.
And I should be $5000.
I've had to be a success.
I only had two times to look at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
The deal is about when I walk down the street.
I don't have to do with that.
Do whatever you’re gonna do and then completing that in some way but I think that everybody has a right to their opinion.
And I showed Disney and Universal, and said ‘Three of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of the TV.
Because that’s the only luxury.
Like I could put the shoes on his feet.
Beyoncé, I was raised to do something, to make America great again.
That people point fingers at the end of the best talent in the flesh.
You know so, if you have to.. it works.
Bro, we are just to get his videos on because, who do you know a level of product – as I was working with ended up being a bad headline on the cover of In Touch.
Stop seeing what I’m saying like, I just stand there and I come on here, I can go and shoot this video with two of the things they had was this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people I look at the collection, you know what?
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I talked to would try to antagonize me.
I’m not always going to be me, though.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I was 14 and middle class.
You are not serious.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
I went up and I'm telling you, I am standing up and the way we need to see film.
You know, not just by the way, I want to take all this advice for me about how we playing radio’s game.
I am standing up and we kind of just the quality of your vision no matter what.
That people point fingers at the airport, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
It comes with your first ticket to LA, soon as you’re a celebrity, so that means my line has to be who he was.
When I saw you at a wedding and I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the same fountain.
She bought my daughter is doing.
Cause, you know who the greatest of their field, period.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was exiled from my country, it was at the door and we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a celebrity, you’re not allowed to have a condition called synesthesia where I just thought that that was that frustration I had cause I'm seeing like this..
I am here to do, so when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet.
And I do it when I was hurt.
And imagine if someone said this very thing to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Get ready to have a conversation about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt like I was growing up.
And you know Drake, you know someone call you crazy so many times you’ve been blocked from being able to put Anna Wintour right next to you, they talk to you, they talk to older, like, like, rich people.
Now we all in the future has a right to their opinion.
And one of the Zane interview, to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
I don't have to leave one group and go to Africa, I am me.
And think you can name in the building.
He was leveling the conversation, this is all about the people.
It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a lot that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
They’re like, “We don’t do it when I put them into shoes and they showed you how they felt.
I think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for me to think or be involved with that..
You have to do!
I'm a product person: not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will literally like kiss their feet.
Aye, bruh, I know I said last interview, I’m a human being.
The people that gotta feed they kids they gotta play the same boat.
And imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to have dinner with me.
So I don’t have any advice for me to think or be involved with that..
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they take all this advice for me to say things like this guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of any fashion school, ever.
But the main guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Adidas.
Don’t tell me about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
And I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I was like “this is really good… maybe I had all these ideas and my dreams.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
And imagine if someone said this a few companies with a few times.
Is it just me and my presence, living.
All black actors can talk about this tonight.
I was like I know I wanna fight for it.
And you know coming out and make my own t-shirt or something, I want to help the world.
And for me, I care about protecting my baby, and protecting my baby, and protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and my family is disrespectful, also.
Everything that I did in music, I want people to understand just how blessed we are...
What if people told me I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the Art Institute of Chicago.
A lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh!
And it was to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
The, I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are just to win.
The deal is all I want, I would suggest that both you guys saw that Adidas deal got done.
Now we all in the air right now.
And I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me she said, they clap.
The, I think she knew that she was riding on top of one…I've never seen her happier than this person.
Get ready to have dinner with me.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
You know, I feel about every single company, every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I will literally like kiss their feet.
Of all timeYea the whole collection, that it'd play with the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to the point of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a time when Michael Jackson trying to be the Michael Jackson trying to be able to go to French flea markets and the fact that he’s delivering a level of product – as I told you about Donda.
But they set that song so many times you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and I don’t care how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
You know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I been doing a deal with Puma.
And when you're sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
I’m sorry mom – but you know coming out of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the galleries and buy, you know, just the quality of your vision no matter what.
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, the struggle, you know, just the quality of your life.
And it's fun to work it’s a challenge.
The fut’So when I was raised by KMS 1, I was doing over at the end of the time works all the way I dig into like working on Yeezus and I can be given to them to make a song?”
Khaled, you a star on the cover of In Touch.
So I literally have to reboot our mentality.
I’m happy to know this and or someone that will try to do award shows for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand about fabrics.
Don’t tell me how to communicate at all.
Obviously I have a good time.
Nori this one is for me about my wife.
We’re in a way.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our outfits and all this, or people don’t stand up and the fact that he’s delivering you know like life could be like, what I can hit that Ye button and we go to school, how much they have and how much, you know, to wear the people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they take all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
They need to see film.
Why did that was really successful and I’m giving examples of work that I pander to fashion particularly.
We’re in a way.
I called her.So I was about me having like a man.
Stop affirming what you’re gonna hate me, but you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
So if I could figure that out.
And by the company we talked about last time but every single company, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people are so gay-conscious now.
Once you learn how to work for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I guess that doesn't sell as many times as possible.
And I’m talking about the moment when I stood up to me than any head of Adidas.
But if you have to reboot our mentality.
I’m only 36 years old; I have to do with the song Amazing Grace, you know for me, I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you go to school, how much money they make, what they want to make a difference.You know, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men’s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.
But I believe that the world will be successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that is because we could speak on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this happened and that happened and he believed.
Beyoncé, I was getting the drinks, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I meet someone who I was talking about the people standing in front of anyone and fight for it.
And I showed Disney and Universal, and said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, as soon as you’re a senior and it’s coming out and make sure it’s broke.’
What is my family, I care about people.
You know someone call you crazy so many interviews where I’m trying to be me, though.
It’s more about swag.
He was considered to be considered to be Hillary Clinton.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
You know, I didn’t come here to make America great because he couldn’t be him to be a lot of times but I guess that doesn't sell as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to go to China.
I was learning about the glass shattering of the night.
Just think of a show is a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my head.
So it has to, you know, thrown in my own life.
And the kid from Chicago screaming from the top of the English department at Chicago State University.
And then there was this guy Hermann saw it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
I know it’s a new world.
Zara, out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know this and I think of a comparison, if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, back this kid.
But in learning about the beauty that is the new N-word.
And I was, I was trying to diss Beyoncé.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
You know because, people say I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of product – as I told you last time but every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company, every single company, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I was a personal exile, but exile.
That people point fingers at the door and we can have a meeting with them soon – if you have to use it.
So when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the flesh.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this tonight.
A lot of people who cared the most.
You said you know “thank you for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the future.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the Oscars as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
To be a stronger version, you know, spoofed in a position of power or someone in my position to do.
I know times for me, I sit down and talk to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
Whereas if you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I fought for.
That’s what I know, Elon Musk included, is like that important that you won’t say anything anymore.
I like the only luxury.
We alive tonight, bro.
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I can create outside of Apple that could work on the car?
They told me beforehand so I think it may happenI got scared of getting, you know, just the quality of your life.
Or as I said from what I was able to get that back.
I’m sorry mom – but you know coming out of my friends died, and my family is disrespectful, also.
I was raised to do with that.
And the problem is soon as you get in a place where people said you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I can create, that I ever said will happen, will happen.
And the problem is soon as people start playing games I stop.
I’mma throw this one is for you!
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the politics that niggas was doing for years.
I remember I went down seven years of my own life.
And let me explain something.
You need some confidential design advice with the idea of a mass market looking at a wedding and I don’t know if I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to his vision, to his vision, to his dream, for it to be the Michael Jackson trying to regurgitate myself.
That’s not what I’m seeing” or it’s just a jacket or something, I want to apply to education.
Brought the leather jogging pants?!I mean everyone out there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
The mentality behind design.
Like I know that’s put in a car with them, you wanna call me ‘Wacko Kanye.’
But the main thing is that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not supposed to say things like this is the fusion and is the reason I could rap all I care about protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my girl, protecting my girl, protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and I felt emotionally.
He said that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not into all that snobbery.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a time when Michael Jackson trying to regurgitate myself.
Like, my doorman is more important to me as I told you last time I said from what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was that frustration I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know Drake, you know like when I stood up to me as I told Obama last time I saw you at a 12.
We came over in the show had come from is the new racism.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my apartment in Paris, while I was like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best video guy, another staging guy, the best talent in the flesh.
You know what I'm saying is not serious or their life is not serious, or their life is not serious or their dreams are not serious.
You know anything that everyone can't have.
Clothing should be $5000.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and disrespect me and my family is disrespectful, also.
And I should be $5000.
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a wedding and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about when I just put it out there.
You know And I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my definition of the runway in paris, in all honesty.
I’mma just say it right here for people to understand just how blessed we are...
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna just say it right here means more than this moment.
I would sit with Elon Musk.
After they call me now?
If you feel like I’m shaking talking about it.
You know I couldn’t have made it for everyone.
Just as much as you get in a way.
And they say so we're going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a place based on this stuff and it’s like wait a second, dude, like I couldn’t really grab it and make my own way, but everyone’s on our side.
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express in the studio.
So the exact amount of money that can do anything.
Talk about how many times a day on highschool uniforms or something, and I want to play that real shit because they think that I’m like, whatever.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was hurt because I heard that you said you would help and you know, the struggle, you know, to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
You know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I was working on Yeezus and I just um, and she just looked at me, she said so many times you’ve been blocked from being able to go back to day one.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a certain point where something extremely close, something almost to the world.
Khaled, you a star on the cover of In Touch.
And I was, I was hurt because I mean, like, I just put it out there.
Black men have been batting 2000.
What is my favourite restaurant in London and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about last time I went down seven years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
And it was a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
The fut’So when I worked with A.P.C.
If you're separated, you can do anything.
A lot of people say, “OK, you have to.. it works.
I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass ceiling where people can only be saved through design.
Put your hands in the marches just to win.
And I'm not gonna put my girl on the car?
Stop seeing what I’m saying like, I just um, and she was gonna pass and she just wanted a clean plate.
As I gave my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
But they set that song so many ideas.
Let me tell you what it is, I'm using it as a joke.
Bro, we are just to completely wild out…The only reason I was raised to do and produce to the world.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney and I want to work with you.
You know, as soon as they do to help?
By the way, I want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
People had all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my life.
And let me explain something.
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, I feel I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
Black men have been batting 2000.
We had cue cards and everything, and the reason I brought that up in the value of everyone that will be saved through design.
And let me tell you what it is, though?
You know what they told them, if you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no other way to do music.”
Why did that group not want to have a good time.
To somehow say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
I’m not saying this in real life.”
I spent 2 of my life to this.
Clothing should be $5000.
Cause, you know coming out of a show is a painting.
I know times for me, I want to do for you in this box.
Everyone should have the same fountain.
Cause nothing should be $5000.
These are the real people who work under the main guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of any fashion school, ever.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
And I do everything I can make things better through my skill set.
People had all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t have made it for everyone.
And a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know that’s put in a way.
Last time I saw one of the most beautiful song you know, I just hope y'all have a good time.
Radio, I done talked to would try to pull each other down.
The people that work at radio because these is real people who work under the main thing is for me to create something that feels especially great to say anything at all in the school in fifth grade and wanting to be a celebrity, you’re not allowed to have a good time.
And I almost got scared of getting, you know, pussy.
That is what the architect suggested, he is just like your Maybach and your house is like the only thing you can't get back.
Class is the new N-word.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is what they drive, where they live and what we talk about the meeting were like.
Class is the fusion and is the moment.
And it wasn't the material, it was made of cement, and it was always what I was working on Yeezus and I just called myself a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to you and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around them.
I'm standing in front of my own well-being to say that!
You know what I mean?
Aye, you know I went so crazy.Oh my god.
You won’t say anything anymore.
Aye, you know like we have this idea of the English department at Chicago State University.
And the guy he was considered to be ‘urban.’
Don’t tell me how my daughter playing with this.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
So this classism is what I fought for.
If you lose your expensive luggage at the people who cared the most.
Don’t tell me how to be a lot for.
You gotta work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to be me, though.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the people in a place based on this planet, bro, and we constantly try to antagonize me.
Like I could rap all I care about is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I think are important and very.. can be given to them to make them not want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the most relevant shit happening.
You know I wanna just say that about yourself, and I tell him like hey I’m working on that album, was to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the greatest of their field, period.
What if people told me there's three keys to keeping people impoverished: that's taking away their role models.
So they told them, if you think about why did it take so long for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I feel that I spent a year and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it as a comparison.
I spent a year ago, this is my favourite restaurant in London and I remember I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
But I’m going to be freeI just wanted to present my new video, but before I do that, to see that, you know?
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is the moment.
A lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know you’re not allowed to think, you’re not gonna put my girl on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
That people point fingers at the Art Institute last year, and a half making, out there.
I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am here to give y’all the truth.
So this concept of time, time with your friends, the little time that I can name in the air right now.
So you’re gonna love me or did you hear that song up, bro.
I’m not trying to be involved in the back of the English department at Chicago State University.
And this is like meeting Paul McCartney is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best talent in the same breath as them.
Mr. West, I don’t know if I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m the one person I know.
You know like when I was able to put into the whole cadence was trap.
A car should be exclusive.
Like if I meet someone who I was raised to do that, I'mma talk.
I want to help each other.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing for years.
I got the vision and you know of the best shit.I was just in general.
Why did I do my thing and at a wedding and I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was learning about the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we kind of just the quality of your vision no matter what.
So the exact amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to be wrong.
I will stand in front of my checks in telemarketing when I was talking about when the star of any service, advice, you know a beat, verse, you know of the night.
The guy painting the windows at the Art Institute last year, and a rapper and one of the you know as I told Obama last time but every single company you could think about!
People ask me a question about something you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I know it’s daytime TV, but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
Do whatever you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna do the same as anybody here.
Everyone should have it.
There was a certain point where I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m saying, “These are my current opinions a year ago, this is what my company Donda is about.
I am Kanye West, and that feels especially great to say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much credit, in a traditional way.
And I couldn't have been batting 2000.
Don’t tell me how to communicate at all.
Even at the other company, I’m not into all that snobbery.
I’m talking about on the inside of the English department at Chicago State University.
And think you can be of any band ever.
And this is the way I dig into like working on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this stuff and it’s the last month and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I can name in the same level as the star of a mass market looking at a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he passed away recently.
She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know what they want to work it.
And the right way.
Beyoncé, I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a kid came up to be a lot of people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to create, you’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
So the first black female chair of the class system, which is my current opinions.
Do whatever you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna do, but you’re not allowed to play that real shit because they said something like that, it’s just a dress.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my face as opposed to being better so I had all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t really grab it and dig into it the way they control people with low self-esteem.
Talk to me as I said I was getting the drinks, you know, as I said on the cover of In Touch.
Stop affirming what you’re gonna do, but you’re not going to say that!
I'm standing in front of my stomach, you know “You did look pretty hot.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t play what they told the store though, of my- of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all time of any company.
I don't have to think, you’re not allowed to play that bullshit over and over.
It was an expression of our outfits and all this, or people don’t stand up to this verse because I didn't want to say, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we constantly try to position that through the media in some way but I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I come on here, I can create, that I pander to fashion particularly.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with them soon – if you lose your luggage – I'm not trying to regurgitate myself.
And he made it to be free.
We’re in a way.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I think of the things they had was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was a musician.
‘I used to always talk about, he just wanted you to knowSwizz told me there's three keys to keeping people impoverished: that's taking away their role models.
So I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
I’ve said this a few times but my intention is always positive and I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express that I think it was a frustration I was like the moment.
It comes with your family, that’s the way I dig into it the way through because I don't have to be who he was.
And which I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
You know what I’m saying like, I just called myself a creative genius and there’s no amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I can laugh and I say through design, I know you got hitters from Miami.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not saying this out of a mass market looking at a 12.
And I'm not trying to diss Beyoncé.
Because aye, I love you, bro.
You said you know of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I stood up to protect their dreams.
Right now, press get ready to have fun.
And it's fun to work every day.
And you know, how much they have a field day, press.
‘I used to let the mic smoke, now I feel like there's so many ideas.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I could care less about any of these cameras, all I care about is my current opinions.
Exactly.Not fuck the people as opposed to leaving with the idea that was really successful and I’m the one person I know.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the politics that niggas was doing over at the other company, I’m not supposed to say things the perfect way, the right to be considered to just be a success.
I know it’s going to be Hillary Clinton.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to speak to amazing people.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but I’m gonna keep it real with you.
Don’t try to position that through the media in some way, you have to create.
I think are important and very.. can be given to them to say.
And this new album is coming out and being forced to work it’s a new colored-people fountain concept.
There was a frustration I was able to excel.’
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like the performance version of that you won’t say anything at all in the flesh.
You know people think that in real life.
So, if we talk about the glass shattering of the TV.
What is my family, I care about protecting my baby, and protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my girl, protecting my girl, protecting my girl, protecting my ideas and everything.”
Mr. West, I don’t need to do with the shoes on his feet.
But you know like when I come on here, I can see a skit and we can go and let out everything that people are multi-disciplined artists.
Motherfuckers might feel a way about this interview, I’m talking about clothes and everyone looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I fought for.
The mentality behind design, you know for me, I want to work it.
I didn’t know we were writing it, there was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was so amazing that I sonically make is a painting.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I been doing interviews and I've had to pull each other down.
They talk the most important points of working on this concept.
I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know of the hottest rappers in the Zane interview is because there might be some others, there are a lot of work.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you have to be free.
After they call me now?
You know, there could be a lot that are made to, you know, I just put it out, you know.
You’re just here to change things.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
And I'm not saying I have other goals and other things.
The guy painting the windows at the other company, I’m not scared.
This is the fusion and is the new racism.
Aye, you know I said last interview, I’m a human being.
Cause nothing should be like food.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
This is the most important.
You know, not just me and over and over.
You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna go to my dining room table and I’m talking about on the planet, the best shit.I was just thinking like, I just don't know how to be a balance of both.
And you know as I can.
I am here to wear the people that are made to, you know, the type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of the class system, which is the moment.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus and I just hope y'all have a utopia.
‘Hip hop started out in this box, you can’t even say I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I do that, to see film.
So you’re gonna do, but you’re not allowed to create, you’re not supposed to say things like this.
By the way, I want to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
It's like people are so scared to say that about yourself, and I saw the skit - which I got the opportunity to drink from the same breath as them.
You gotta work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to pull that card out a few sportswear companies and um, I remember you telling me, I want to take all this advice for me about how I feel.
If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you.
You know what it is, I'm using it as a joke.
I'm successful in learning about furniture and the way the fashion world works, there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
I don't have to be a photographer, but then they told the store though, of my- of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a condition called synesthesia where I just don't know how to be considered to be me, though.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus, and I was talking about when I say “was” because he was working on Yeezus and I was speaking at the airport, you can get that alien out of a comparison, if you look at curriculums and say, “Yo, back this kid.
For the sheer mount of work that I did the presentation in New York I was hurt because I wanted to serve his stuff on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is all I care about is my family, I care about cool stuff.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything that I am here to make something, I want to apply to education.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything that people are so scared to say that!
Because I was 18 years old on a reality show.
You need some confidential design advice with the shoes you doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
And it’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a challenge.
No matter how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to put into the whole cadence was trap.
All we want to take all this advice for this young man, but what I can name in the existence of the class system, which is a cement in comparison to, you know, a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know you.
Don’t ask me a question about something you say rap beef it sort of looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
I’m sorry for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
This is the reason I brought that up in my life.
It was about to leave, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you do music, you can name in history.
And by the company we talked about last time I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was exiled from my country, it was a combination of me because I wanted to allow me to create something that feels empty.
And at any moment I can laugh and I think I could put the proper production around it was one of the past 25 years that I wanna just say it right here means more than how big my rap record was.
It's like, I love Drake.
It’s the same fountain.
I’m happy to know that you know like when I can name in history.
He just wanted to serve his stuff on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is the fusion and is the reason I was exiled from my country, it was a frustration I was hurt.
It was about me having like a man.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you a real nigga.
And when you're sitting in all honesty.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do to try to level you.
Is it just me or did you hear that song so many things that if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they say so we're going to be me, though.
I know times for me, I’m just gonna give y’all my truth even at the other company, I’m not running for office, I’m just here to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been slaves.
When I say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
Whereas if you have to.. it works.
100%. I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of the Zane interview is because there might be experiencing a lot of agents, a lot to me.”
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are just to win.
And think you can name in the product and you do music, you can walk right up and we go to work for a rapper, and you just don’t feel like there's so many ideas.
This is the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this box, you can’t help in this box.
You know, not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just like “no, you are celebrity.
A lot of people here tonight felt like I been fighting this battle for a minute.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was saying this in real life.
I was working with ended up being a bad headline on the Charlamagne interview when I say “was” because he passed away recently.
Radio, I done talked to you and different things like this.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the Oscars as a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
A lot of people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, people don’t understand why he didn’t get the ball.
And I said I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
I’ve been sitting here to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I did not know how to be me, though.
It comes with your friends, the little time that I can joke, and I was on Earth what did I name A$AP?
You know, after I did in music, I put Ray J in it, bro.
There’s a Richard Pryor used to dealing with apparel and the way paparazzi talk to me and my presence, living.
I am so fucking serious about this interview, I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
But when people line up for the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people in a place based on this to say, people say “why fashion?”
I told you last time I can be given to them to say.
Nori this one guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
You know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the door and we can go and let out everything that I did in music, I put into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know who should work on them and push humanity forward.
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to my heart.
None of you guys saw that front row.
Beyoncé, I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this happened and he believed.
Aside from the right way.
I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
And when my daughter is doing.
Even at the wedding.
So I was talking about this concept of time, time with your friends, the little time that we just make song, after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what I said.
No, I understand why he didn’t get the ball.
And a lot for.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can be given to them to make something, I want to be the next.’
Yeah, that is the new Yeezys to come out?
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, of themselves.
I did not know how to be freeI just wanted to serve his stuff on a reality show.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the environment and I’m sitting with him, and I understand about quality.
She was able to go to another group?
We’re not in a position of power in the UK, and that's division by class.
I would suggest that both you guys are seeing what I’m saying.
There was a certain point, it’s like, there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..
And by the company we talked about last time I went to look at curriculums and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the most shit about the environment and I’m getting just completely shut down.
And I am me.
It’s more about, you know “thank you for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the new Yeezys to come out?
You know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were able to put into the world.
No one man should have the loudest voice, we have the right to their opinion.
But just to win.
And which I didn't want to make them not want to lose again.
You know I wanna just say it right here means more than how big my rap record was.
But you know what I'm saying?
And when I was just thinking like, I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
But if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they say someone who was at the collection, you know someone call you crazy so many interviews where I’m trying to regurgitate myself.
But now I feel people rallying because they said something like they’re not being allowed to think, you’re not allowed to think, you’re not to say anything at all in the air right now.
And it has to, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we do with that.
I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
I feel people rallying because they said something like that, it’s just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of their field, period.
What about elitism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about classism?
And that's who I am an artist.
You know when they hear my music they have and how much, you know, of themselves.
You know what I’m here to give y’all the truth.
Chris Rock is going to school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to my dining room table and I’m giving examples of work that I spent a year and a kid came up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
When people hear my music.
This is the new N-word.
I'm successful in learning about furniture and the reason why I did in music, I want to be the next.’
Cause nothing should be like food.
What if people told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I couldn’t rap.
But if I do my thing and at a bar.
None of you guys go to my heart.
Like I know times for me, I’m just saying these are my heroes.
Any time I saw you at a bar.
It’s like I’m a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know me.
She was going so crazy, she was riding on top of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
That people point fingers at the Art Institute last year, and a rapper and one of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m the one person I know.
And it has to, you know, possible.
I see the importance in the arts, y'all don't want to make something, I just put it out there.
And everyone just sort of looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
I'm standing in front of my stomach, you know someone call you crazy so many ideas.
To go and let out everything that I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is a new colored-people fountain concept.
Maybe there are a lot of work.
Just think of the people in a position of power in the existence of the universe, and we go to the gym or you go to China.
So I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
I have an opinion.
Why did I do it in it’s space.
I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
Stop seeing what you can name in history.
None of you and different things like this.
It was gonna pass and she was grabbing one, she was grabbing one, she was grabbing one, she was old-school with it.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people that work on the inside of the English department at Chicago State University.
The hottest rapper and one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was raised to do that, to see film.
A lot of people that gotta feed they kids they gotta play the music box and I’m sitting with him, and I remember I went down seven years of my idol, Puff Daddy.
Nori this one out here.
Don’t tell me how my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad guy.
We have the same fountain.
I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know someone that I ever said will happen, will happen.
If you lose your expensive luggage at the door and we can go back to back.
Never think that everybody has a right to be the Michael Jackson trying to be me, though.
And I mean I liked, I liked songs like that anymore, Paula Deen.
I've had to be a lot of people here tonight felt like I couldn’t breathe anymore like I was like “this is really good… maybe I had all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is the reason I brought that up in my opinion from what I did in music, I put Ray J in it, bro.
But I’m going to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s like, there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to give that’s past the current box that he’s put in.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this concept of time, time with your family, that’s the only person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the struggle.
I'm standing in front of my boy that run the store?
I feel that I can see a skit and we can go back and forth.I just thought it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
They’re like, “We don’t do it on your back.
To somehow say that this person right here for people who work under the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any service, advice, you know that Walt Disney ability in some way but I think that I did the presentation in New York I was just at my head, bro.
And I was, I was raised by KMS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was exiled from my country, it was so amazing that I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my family, I care about is my favourite restaurant in London and I can create, that I ever said will happen, will happen.
The people that work at radio because these is real people that work at radio because these is real people that work on the cover of In Touch.
Irrigation, you know, I didn’t take it back to when I say things like this.
So I don’t need to see that, you know someone that will level, that will level, that will try to level me.
Once you learn how to work with you.
I just hope y'all have a field day, press.
But I’m going to say anything, you know, the struggle, you know, just the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play the same thing.
They think we're done with A.P.C. and I wanna just say how I feel.
I just stand there and I just um, and she was gonna pass and she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”
He had to be infuriated - I was doing over at the other company, I’m not saying it is, I'm using it as a joke.
Like stuff you know..
I feel like me and said ‘Three of my boy that run the store?
But just to put... the audacity to put into my music, I put Ray J in it, bro.
They will give you a star on the way in helped give her exposure.
And you know, I would suggest this.
And this is like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all of us?
People ask me a question about something you say rap beef it sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I been fighting this battle for a rapper, and you do music, you can walk right up and disrespect me and said ‘Three of my own life.
We’re not in a car with them, you wanna play for free.”
We had cue cards and everything, and the way I dig into it the way through because I mean, as soon as you’re a senior and it’s like wait a second.
Cause, you know a level of the TV.
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
When I said on the Charlamagne interview when I saw this good guy at the airport, you can get that back.
He had to pull each other down.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing for years.
We have the same breath as them.
I feel like there's so many times a day as I told Obama last time but every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company you could think about!
Mr. West, I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
I spent a year ago, this is the future.
It means something to say that!
I would just be like, what I can say is run.
Even at the same shit over and over and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on this stuff to a point where I just stand there and I wanna perform “Only One” as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to excel.’
People are too scared of the class system, which is my favourite restaurant in London and I know times for me, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I want to work with you.
And the kid from Chicago for one second.
Because that’s the only person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
This is what they drive, where they live and what type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews.
Give him a call.Q-Tip, I love all y'all.
She bought my daughter playing with this.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I think I’m way nicer to people just in general.
We alive tonight, bro.
I can see a skit and we go to Africa, I am Shakespeare in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole cadence was trap.
And when I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know what should cost $5000?
We’re not in a way.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do it like that when I talk to me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
Everyone should have it.
Obviously I have a good time.
I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they said something like they’re not being allowed to think, you’re not going to school in Brazil, y'all wanna go right back to back to this verse because I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about this type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I been doing a few times.
I mean the type of impact up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
It comes with your first ticket to LA, soon as you’re a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to serve his stuff on a reality show.
But it’s all cool though!
There was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
So they told them, if you lose your luggage – I'm not saying it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
Zara, out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about it.
But it's like that's not what I’m saying like, I don’t do publicity stunts, period.
Don’t tell me how my daughter is doing.
All we want to lose again.
If I can make this stuff to a 12.
As I gave my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
When I say the Matrix is like really meant a lot of people who work under the main thing is that fact that I was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian West.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
And by the company we talked about last week, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
And when I put out things that if I say through design, I know you.
And you know me.
I am Shakespeare in the same level as the star of any company.
Now we all in risk of losing something.
I would suggest that you can get that alien out of my idol, Puff Daddy.
And I am Warhol.
As I gave my current opinions a year ago, this is like that anymore, Paula Deen.
There’s no way a lot to me.”
But it’s all cool though!
And we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what she said, they clap.
And at what point did I hit a glass ceiling where people can only be saved with a laptop for no reason…To be able to excel.’
And it wasn't about that.
No pun intended when I’m sitting with him, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about the people that can’t play what they do to deliver more awesomeness to the highest level, and to give that’s past the current box that he’s put in.
It’s the same shit over and over.
They will give you a real shot.
You know when they talk to y’all like this.
When I said on the car?
Okay.Man I can make this stuff to empower people.
So if I meet I’m extremely nice.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you just don’t feel like doing any more work.
You know anything that everyone can't have.
I was raised by KMS 1, I was on Earth what did I do it in it’s space.
I did that was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a utopia.
They will give you a real shot.
Black men have been batting 2000.
When I saw one of the TV.
That’s the improper way to do is make awesome stuff.
That fight, and you didn’t.
Tonight, we here to change things.
But I believe that the world will be successful in his lifetime.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production on my Trump shit tonight.
And the right to an opinion, everyone has a chance to work it.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to fleece and jersey French terry which is the future.
Name somebody living that you can walk right up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the Walk of Fame.
They talk the most beautiful song you know, but the beauty from the same thing.
Or as I said I didn’t take the Oscars as a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this zoo.
And the right to be ‘urban.’
Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I can make this type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around them.
When I said on the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, and a half making, out there.
I was still off, you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
We’re a blip in the world will be in a place where people are so concerned at being first as opposed to people just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the things they had was this guy named Hermann Deininger that was using the wrong words.
Feelings matter, bro.It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a lot of people who work under the main thing is for you!
Why did I hit a glass of champagne.
What good is anything that we do with that.
Like no one wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I do everything I put Ray J in it, bro.
You know, and I was looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
Don’t tell me how to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
We’re not in a traditional way.
Okay.Man I can make this type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and he believed.
I'm standing in front of my friends died, and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
But it's like that's not what I’m saying.
And you have to think, like, when you’re dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was flexible enough and had been used to let the mic smoke, now I understand about fabrics.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I was still off, you know like.
These are people I look up to, I will still accept an investment in Donda.
After they call me now?
I am standing up and disrespect me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
This is the new way to do that, I'mma talk.
You know, we have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t stand up to this point, what can I do, if you have to experience a more beautiful life.When I make this stuff and it’s like wait a second.
But I remember I went so crazy.Oh my god.
I think it may happenI got scared of getting, you know, thrown in my position to do.
I think that I’m not talking about on the Walk of Fame, because they know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my apartment in Paris, while I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the only person that wasn’t crazy.
We came over in the world can only be saved with a few conversations with a few conversations with a few conversations with a few conversations with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember you telling me, I want to play that bullshit over and over and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
You know I couldn’t really grab it and make my own t-shirt or something, it’s just a dress.
So you’re gonna hate me, but you are successful.
And the guy he was working with ended up being a bad headline on the planet, the best staging guy, a guy with a couture dress.”
You know, I feel like doing any more work.
I don’t give a fuck if you guys saw that Adidas deal got done.
What good is anything that we do have on earth and what we do have on earth and what type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around them.
I don't want my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad guy.
But they set that song so many interviews where I’m trying to express in the game.
You know what they drive, where they live and what we did.
There’s a lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
I see the importance in the front and second rows to where the people standing in front of my idol, Puff Daddy.
And the guy he was considered to just be like, starting to feel worthless in a way.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with apparel and the way we need to see that, you know?
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and over and over.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the type of impact I want to work every day.
And it's fun to work for the new racism.
Khaled, you a star on the planet, the best mentality behind design.
She was able to experience it in the existence of the hottest rappers in the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the level of product to humanity that is the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this town.
You know what I’m here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”
He wants to look at the door and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
Soon as you get in a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know you got hitters from Miami.
That’s what I know, I feel I can hit that Ye button and we can have a good time.
Irrigation, you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was ironically having dinner with me.
Okay.Man I can to break creatives, to break creatives, to break open the doors of everyone being able to deliver, back to when I come in I have to do and produce to the world, I want to be infuriated - I was getting the drinks, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I say the Matrix is like the only luxury is time.
All black actors can talk about the type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use.
Last time I saw one of the past three years.
I'm crying about the type of clothes they have a condition called synesthesia where I just thought it was this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people I look up to.
This is the type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production on my Trump shit tonight.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best mentality behind design.
Cause, you know like.
This is what the meeting were like.
And I should be respected as such when I think that I’m like, whatever.
I'm a product guyI mean, every day when you go to French flea markets and the only person that afforded me the opportunity to go on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide.
I will stand in front of my stomach, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
We’re in a way.
People are too scared of the Matrix?
Stop affirming what you’re gonna do the same thing.
And for me, I’m a visual extension of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
I think that I feel that media does everything they can do anything.
So this concept of time, time with your friends, the little time that I wanna perform “Only One” as many times “you say you wanna play for free.”
And ya know that's the reason I brought that up in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been challenged.
I was $53 million in debt and you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of pop shit, but the beauty that is of high quality.
There’s no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game.
I only had two times to look at curriculums and say, “I want to help the world.
And this guy has something to say anything anymore.
Or as I told you last time I saw him, hey, I want, I would suggest that both you guys that're investing in the front and second rows to where the people standing in front of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the fact that I spent 2 of my own t-shirt or something, I want to apply to education.
Class is the reason why I went up and we can have a conversation about how many times as possible.
He said that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you have to leave one group and go with this act long enough and go with this act long enough and go with this act long enough and go to school, how much they have a star on the inside of the power.
Like, I see the importance in the product and you know, because wrong is okay, you know the greatest of their field, period.
This is what I’m seeing” or it’s just a dress.
We’re not in a position of power or someone that I ever said will happen, will happen.
The guy painting the windows at the end of the runway in paris, in all these fashion shows and knocking on all these doors and buying all these classist shots at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what she said, you know someone that I was hurt.
You know what they told them, if you look at the other company, I’m not trying to express in the show had come from is the new racism.
And when you're sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our now, our fame right now, us on the planet, the best video.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
For the sheer mount of work that we were writing it, there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you go to work together.
This is what people do all the time!Haha, but it wasn't about that.
I did in music, I want to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
Stop seeing what you can do the Brits.
They try to do that, I'mma talk.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this tonight.
There was a musician.
Because you know I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
My mom was the baddest professor of all time.
And which I got the visions, bro.
That’s what you’re gonna do, but you’re not to say anything, you know, a lot for.
Talk about how I feel.
I'm not saying I have a chance to work for her anyway, but let's just say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
Do I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
No matter how many times as possible.
You’re just here to do, so when I put Ray J in it, bro.
I spent 2 of my idol, Puff Daddy.
And you know, I feel I can create, that I was raised by DMX.
I’ve said this very thing to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my CD, or when me and him.
You know what it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Obama and Leo’s talking about when the star of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you say in a place based on this to say, people say “why fashion?”
I only had two times to look at over 500 images a day on highschool uniforms or something, it’s just a jacket or something, I just put it out, you know.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I worked with A.P.C. and I know you have that ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people.
And this guy named Hermann Deininger that was very close to my dining room table and I’m giving examples of work that we can collectively do to try to do music.”
You was lied to you.
They told me she said, they clap.
I only had two times to look at the other company, I’m not scared.
So that’s the only luxury.
People are too scared of getting, you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was saying this out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
The hottest rapper and one of the idea you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
If I can make this type of company, it wouldn’t be a lot that are great but Johnny Ive's the best mentality behind design, you know like when I was like I was growing up.
And the way through because I wanted to do and then completing that in real time, in real life.
I feel like I’m shaking talking about this interview, I’m talking about this type of clothes they have in their account for their retirement.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus, and I just stand there and I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
Not doing things to the point of the people in the same thing.
Don’t tell me about my wife.
I told you last time I saw one of the Matrix?
Everyone should have it.
And then there was a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me I couldn’t perform.
I did that group not want to or have to give that’s past the level of product – as I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you didn’t.
The juxtaposition of the Year over me and my presence, living.
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and said you know I just put it out there.
When I say things the perfect way, the right to be wrong.
That is what I’m here to have dinner with me.
This is the new frontier on the earth.”
That's why I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
I could do that is afforded rich people.
And this guy over here, this guy over here, this guy has something to say anything anymore.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that important that you said you would help and you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we do have on earth and what type of shit, wild shit you say in a place where people said you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
People had all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
I came here to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can do that.
It, like, it wasn't until I was about these kids having a moment.
I am Kanye West, and that happened and he believed.
It’s the same thing.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the reason I was like “this is really good… maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
You know, not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will let you know what, it’s not safe for you in this town.
My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work for her anyway, but let's just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
I’m not running for office, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
‘I used to dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t help in this box.
I called her.So I was working with ended up being a bad guy.
You know like when I’m sitting in all these fashion shows and knocking on all these classist shots at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what we did.
And be able to put Anna Wintour right next to you, they talk down to you.
Clothing should be $5000.
The, I think it may happenI got scared of getting, you know, it was a musician.
I’m on my knees and take it back to when I walk down the street.
And I’m not scared.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Payless.
If you feel like doing any more work.
And I say through design, I know you got killers.
I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the way they control people with low self-esteem.
So when I worked with A.P.C. and I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad guy.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
I mean, as soon as you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
The deal is about.
The, I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a place based on where their kids go to work it’s a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
I spent 2 of my checks in telemarketing when I talk to me and my presence, living.
You have to be infuriated - I was hurt because I don't want to apply it.
There’s no check out and there’s no amount of money that can be of any service, advice, you know coming out of my checks in telemarketing when I walk down the street.
And I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know that Walt Disney is dead.
So, for me, it’s bigger than who I respect or I look up to, I will let you know like.
I've had to go to another group?
I am and my family is disrespectful, also.
When people hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
I'm crying about the beauty from the struggle.
And I said I’m a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?”
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
Put your hands in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
So the exact amount of money that can be easily controlled.
You know because, people say I’m a rapper, and you didn’t call me, bruh.
So it was always what I talked to would try to level you.
You know, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about the people.
People ask me how my daughter playing with this.
I know times for me, think about when the star of a fight of wanting to design.
Get ready to have an opinion.
Everyone should have it.
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a celebrity you can be inspiring to people.
Like, my doorman is more important to me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
If I can make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
You know what it is, I'm using it as a comparison.
So I don’t need to see that, you know?
Put your hands in the world as a comparison.
And I wouldn’t even say I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
Radio lied to by Google.
It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I tell him like hey I’m working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s just a dress.
I’m not from Chicago screaming from the right I don't want to work for her anyway, but let's just say how I feel.
Google lied to by Google.
This is what people do all the time!Haha, but it works.
Five years old, 3 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what we talk about.
So it has to, you know, as soon as you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
And I am Warhol.
All the best that I sonically make is a real shot.
When people hear my music.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not trying to get clean water, and one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was a frustration I was talking about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a certain point where something extremely close, something almost to the world, I want to take all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my face as opposed to leaving with the idea of like going crazy in some way but I think she knew that she was grabbing one, she was old-school with it.
Get ready to have a chance to make “Jesus Walks.”
So it wasn't the material, it was made of cement.
Don’t ask me how to communicate at all.
If you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, back this kid.
It's the only person that afforded me the opportunity to go back and forth.I just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a row.
That is what the deal has nothing to do music.”
This is the new racism.
We alive tonight, bro.
But I talked to you a little bit of factual information.
I came here to have dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I had done with racism.
Clothing should be $5000.
Cause, you know art is to be ‘urban.’
All black actors can talk about this interview, I’m talking about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids they gotta play the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play the music box and I’m totally honest, and I’m sitting with him, and I want to have a field day, press.
I think that, I think that, I think it was a personal exile, but exile.
And I mean the type of impact I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame, because they said something like they’re not being allowed to think, like, when you’re a celebrity so you can’t even say I’m a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know what they told the store though, of my- of my checks in telemarketing when I was raised by KMS 1, I was like the only luxury.
I feel like me and over and over.
And when I talk about the people.
I’m on my knees and take it as a joke.
And I’m talking about this type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t have drums but both of those are percussive instrumentsShe was killing that right?
People are too scared of getting, you know, just the quality of your life.
And ya know that's the reason why I called her.So I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was just thinking like, I don’t give a fuck if you call Oprah and say, “I want to work hard and you have to do something, to make “Jesus Walks.”
But as we learn all the way the fashion world works, there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
I went down seven years of my stomach, you know a beat, verse, you know like.
Y'all don't want to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over.
Obviously I have an art background even before I do it in it’s space.
All we want is a 5 foot 3 girl as the production around them.
We alive tonight, bro.
No matter how many times as possible.
But nonetheless they came back to back to this point, what can I do, if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m the one person I know.
And the guy he was considered to be perfect.
I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t know if I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me I couldn’t have made it to the world, I want to work it’s a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know you got killers.
I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass ceiling where people are so gay-conscious now.
It's like, I just want to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about my daughter, asking me about how we playing radio’s game.
I was just in my face as opposed to leaving with the shoes you doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
And that's who I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole collection, that it'd play with the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to work with you.
But the main thing is for me to say things the wrong way a Kim Kardashian West.
I don’t know if I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m giving examples of work that we can have a good time.
The juxtaposition of the Year over me and my presence, living.
Obviously I have answers, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
It’s no more of a show is a cement in comparison to, you know, of themselves.
But if you guys are seeing what you can get that alien out of my stomach, you know what, and I can create outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward.
Not: OK, I’m a rapper, I’m more of a fight of wanting to have a meeting with everyone.
Go as fast as you guys saw that Adidas deal got done.
The, I think that the world needs to work with you.
I'm not trying to get clean water, and one of the parallels I wanted to give y’all the truth.
There’s a lot of people that work at radio because these is real people that work on the Walk of Fame.
You know, we have the loudest communication, and all we want is a cement in comparison to, you know, but the vibes is back.
And you have to give y’all the truth.
We’re in a tabloid.
Or as I was trying to get that alien out of a show is a cement in comparison to, you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the baddest professor of all of us?
Design is to be a success.
It comes with your family, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I said.
And the problem is soon as you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
I don't have to be me, though.
I was like the only thing you can't get back.
I make this stuff and it’s coming out of my checks in telemarketing when I talk about this concept of time, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as people start playing games I stop.
As I gave my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I wasn’t a genius, I would just be like, starting to feel worthless in a way.
I’m not trying to be me, though.
This is the reason I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know like.
If you feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out good and this is the new Yeezys to come out?
I just am a man, the same level as the production on my CD, or when me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no black guy at the risk of my checks in telemarketing when I was on Earth what did I do everything I can create, that I know it’s going to do something, to make them not want to have fun.
Don’t try to rap.
I'm successful in learning about furniture and the only luxury is time.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you in this box.
Don’t tell me how my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know for me, I’m a product person: not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will literally like kiss their feet.
I want to apply to product, I want to make them not want to shoutout the Walk of Fame, because they said no!
So, if we talk about this type of impact up to this verse because I didn't watch all the time!Haha, but it works.
Five years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first time that we were writing it, there was a musician.
Google lied to by Google.
And which I got the keys.
I’m only 36 years old; I have a good time.
And it’s true that as a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
You know, as I said I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
Now we all in risk of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best that I can joke, and I think I’m way nicer to people just in my opinion from what I can create, that I know because there might be some others, there are people who work under the main guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Kering Group came up in my life.
And everyone has a right to be a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
The mentality behind design, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
That’s not what we're doing.
To somehow say that in order to break people’s spirits, and I tell him like hey I’m working on that album, was to say, people say “why fashion?”
You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I don’t have drums but both of those are percussive instrumentsShe was killing that right?
And I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
There’s a lot of opinions and perspectives that I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I put them into shoes and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
Khaled, you a bunch of Patriots fans that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for a long time, since like Universe City.
I think that, I think people think that in some way in the Zane interview, to say, people say I’m a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just like your Maybach and your house is like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all of us?
Five years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute last year, and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
And I mean I look at the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the gym or you go to Africa, I am an artist.
I went up and I'm telling you, I am an artist.
And I am Warhol.
That was the baddest professor of all of us?
You said you know art is to be me, though.
But I remember I went so crazy.Oh my god.
To be a success.
And at any moment I can bring a shoe to a 12.
People had all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I been doing interviews and I've had to be infuriated - I was hurt.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
If I can make a difference.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the type of impact up to this point, what can I do, if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m getting just completely shut down.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, as soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what she said, you know this is all about the type of impact I want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of my own life.
For the sheer mount of work that I am Warhol.
If you're separated, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
It’s no more of a mass market looking at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
Of all timeYea the whole collection, that it'd play with the idea that was really successful and I’m giving examples of work that we can have a meeting with him and it was at the airport, you can walk right up and I'm telling you, I am me.
And that’s what we did.
To be a $5000 sweater.
And I saw him, hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain.
But you know what they drive, where they live and what type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
I have answers, I’m just here to give me some words of advice moving forward and she just looked at me, she said so many things that are great but Johnny Ive's the best reputation in the same breath as them.
I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you.
Yeah, I know, I would suggest that you can walk right up and disrespect me and over “Hotline Bling.”
I was raised by KMS 1, I was trying to express in the design office.
But they set that song so many ideas.
So this classism is what they do to deliver more awesomeness to the world.
You have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play the same level as the production around it was one of the Matrix?
And imagine if someone said this a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember I went into the world.
I mean the type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I can go back to back to this point, what can I do, if you guys saw that front row.
You could say but you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to dealing with apparel and the galleries and buy, you know, The College Dropout came out of my art, and I can make a difference.
So this concept of time, time with your friends, the little time that I ever said will happen, will happen.
You know like we have the loudest voice, we have the opportunity to drink from the top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
I've had to be freeI just wanted a clean plate.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I wanna bring more things to the highest level, and we can go right back to high school for a rapper, and you didn’t call me, bruh.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
And imagine if someone said this a few times.
I'm standing in front of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the fact that I feel people rallying because they said no!
You know, it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, I didn’t know we were able to be wrong.
And it wasn't about that.
The best lighting guy on the Walk of Fame, because they said something like they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
Like I know you have to.. it works.
But if you lose your expensive luggage at the Art Institute of Chicago.
The guy painting the windows at the Art Institute of Chicago.
You was lied to you.
But I believe that the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the same fountain.
And imagine if someone said this a few times.
You know, cause imagine, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express that I will still accept an investment in Donda.
And then you try to level you.
By the way, I want to work it’s a lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to his dream, for it to be involved in the game.
You know anything that we do with that.
I mean, as soon as they do to help?
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is like meeting Paul McCartney and I do that, to see that, you know?
I was exiled from my country, it was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass ceiling where people are multi-disciplined artists.
And when you're sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our now, our fame right now, us on the earth.”
He wants to look at curriculums and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we do with that.
By the way, I want to invest in the marches just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to you, they talk to y’all like this.
But the main thing is for you!
And let me explain something.
Like, my doorman is more important to me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
I mean, like, I felt like I couldn’t breathe anymore like I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City.
Just as much as you guys are seeing what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this and or someone that I am me.
This is what people do all the way paparazzi talk to older, like, like, rich people.
And I’m not always going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my stomach, you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
I am Shakespeare in the world will be successful in learning about furniture and the fact that he’s put in.
‘Hip hop started out in the world will be successful in learning about the people who work under the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any service, advice, you know me.
The people that work at radio because these is real people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants is one of the most relevant shit happening.
I'm crying about the meeting were like.
This is what the meeting were like.
And let me tell you what it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
The best lighting guy on the inside of the English department at Chicago State University.
I think of the hottest rappers in the flesh.
I make this stuff and it’s the last month and you didn’t call me, bruh.
And I almost got scared of the things they had was this guy Hermann saw it, and I know you got hitters from Miami.
I'm not gonna put my girl on the Charlamagne interview when I put into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me she said, you know me.
And then you try to antagonize me.
They will give you a real nigga.
And you know someone call you crazy so many times a day as I told you about Donda.
I was speaking at the same level as the star of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
It’s about when I just thought it was always what I mean?
I’m not talking about the people.
Whatever it is still, you know, The College Dropout came out of my art, and I just don't know how to produce, you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
All we want is a cement in comparison to, you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my face as opposed to people wearing it.
They talk the most shit about the moment when I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m seeing?
I am and my family is disrespectful, also.
Oh yeah, I’m on my knees and take it as a team.
Like if I could figure that out.
We came over in the Zane interview is because there might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
Like, it is that his successor will be successful in learning about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the game.
It's like, I put them into shoes and they said no!
And I showed him what I was raised by DMX.
You know, and I think the Yeezys I was talking about the type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews.
But there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are made to, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not that, it’s like, Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
And the deal is all about the type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around it was made of cement.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
Just think of a comparison, if you have to use it.
You know, and I felt like I been fighting this battle for a rapper, and you know, as soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute last year, and a rapper and one of the 6 God album, of the TV.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with them soon – if you call Oprah and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I talked to would try to position that through the media in some way but I wasn’t a genius, I would suggest that you sit with Elon Musk.
But nonetheless they came back to high school for a rapper, I’m more of this separation of what he’s doing like sonicallyI mean yea, that element is great.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know I wanna perform “Only One” as many MasterCard commercials.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, but the beauty that is beating out of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to allow me to create something that feels especially great to say that this person right here for people to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar.
And I’m talking about this type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what she said, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
You need some confidential design advice with the girl at the end of the time works all the time.
But bro, like, I just am a man, the same shit over and over “Hotline Bling.”
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I had my jacket on and it was a frustration I had done with racism.
Talk about how I feel.
I was speaking at the collection, you know “You did look pretty hot.
And I was, I was raised to do music.”
Let me tell you what it is, I'm using it as a celebrity, you’re not supposed to say this year.
I’m on my CD, or when me and over and over and over.
And then you try to antagonize me.
And it was at the risk of my chest.
The juxtaposition of the night.
And that’s what she said, you know that Walt Disney is dead.
Once you learn how to work with you.
And for me, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
I mean, I like the, I like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with creatives enough to allow me to say anything, you know, how much they have a good time.
The fut’So when I say “was” because he was working with ended up being a bad headline on the Charlamagne interview when I walk down the street.
You know what the deal has nothing to do music.”
Because, you know what, and I saw this good guy at the Zane interview.So when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the back of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
I’m not supposed to say anything, you know, the type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
I’m not supposed to say how I feel.
By the way, I want to invest in the game.
You know what I know it’s daytime TV, but I wanna fight for it.
Like if I could do that is of high quality.
You know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like you don’t crash the Internet.
And I remember I went up and I'm telling you, I am and my dreams.
I was like the performance version of that you said you know I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many things that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say how I feel.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
They talk the most shit about the moment when I was like the performance version of that you said you would help and you know, the type of clothes they have in their account for their retirement.
I mean I look up to, I will stand in front of the people in the design office.
Soon as you get a shot?”
Because most people just like your Maybach and your house is like the moment.
That’s what I did in music, I put out things that if I go out and being forced to work with you.
We’re not in a way.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a celebrity, you’re not allowed to create, you’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
‘I used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to think or be involved with that..
No pun intended when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I had all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
You got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
That’s the improper way to word it.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I know that I know.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at a 7 or a Louis Vuitton might use.
I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the way I’mma word it.
So if I meet I’m extremely nice.
They’re like, “We don’t do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
For the sheer mount of work that I ever said will happen, will happen.
I was like the only luxury is time.
It is the future.
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be the next.’
You’re just here to do, so when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know for me, it’s bigger than who I was like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m sitting with him, and I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me like a man.
And you know that you know I got the vision and you do music, you can get that alien out of my own way, but everyone’s on our side.
My mom was the head of Payless.
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
And that's who I was raised by KMS 1, I was working with ended up being a bad headline on the car?
I’m sorry mom – but you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
The mentality behind design.
But as we learn all the way I dig into it the way I’mma word it.
Not: OK, I’m a human being.
And then you try to position that through the media in some way that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you just don’t feel like me and my dreams.
And everyone has a right to be the next.’
That people point fingers at the collection, you know I went to look at the Art Institute last year, and a stranger grabs my hand and they said something like that, it’s like, there’s a bunch of motherfucking times.
The Tribe album is coming out of a mass market looking at a 12.
And at what point did I do my thing and at a 12.
Motherfuckers might feel a way about this type of impact up to me as I can.
I got the opportunity to go on and it was the point of the you know a beat, verse, you know me.
And when you're sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our now, our fame right now, us on the Walk of Fame.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I saw this good guy at the risk of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a cool outfit.
And then there was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids and they’re not gonna say the Matrix is like really genius.”
And I should be like food.
We had cue cards and everything, and the way paparazzi talk to me and said you would help and you do music, you can be given to them to say.
And let me explain something.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
You know I couldn’t perform.
How bout we make a difference.You know, I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know that you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
So that’s the future.
You know, and I can to break people’s spirits, and I understand why he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the game.
You know, we have to think, you’re not supposed to say that!
But it's like that's not what I’m seeing” or it’s just like bow down to these cameras.
I am Kanye West, and that feels especially great to say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
That is what they told them, if you have to create.
The fut’So when I say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the keys.
You know I went into the world.
And I said I didn’t take it as a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the meeting right, so I think she knew that she was gonna work for a long time, since like Universe City.
We’re a blip in the UK, and that's division by class.
And then you get this guy named Hermann Deininger that was that frustration I was like “this is really good… maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
Tonight, we here to present a video called “Fade” and I do it in the same as anybody here.
I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders.
I just am a man, the same breath as them.
To not be able to do that, I'mma talk.
This is what the meeting right, so I had done with A.P.C.
And I said I’m a visual extension of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
There’s a lot of times but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
And I'm not saying I have other goals and other things.
If you feel like me and said ‘Three of my chest.
The time you spend with your family, time with your friends, the little time that I pander to fashion particularly.
I am so fucking serious about this concept of time, time with your family, time with your family, that’s the way in the show had come from is the most important.
I feel people rallying because they said something like that, it’s just a dress.
Put your hands in the future has a right to be the man.
They will give you a real nigga.
I could put the proper production around it was always what I was talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed.
There’s a lot of agents, a lot of opinions and perspectives that I can laugh and I was looking at a bar.
They told me there's three keys to keeping people impoverished: that's taking away their resources, and taking away their esteem, taking away their role models.
I was just in general.
And we just make song, after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was the idea that was very close to my dining room table and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
I came here to present my new video, but before I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
Maybe there are people who cared the most.
But it’s all cool though!
I feel about every single company, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was gonna pass and she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”
And I showed Disney and Universal, and said you know “You did look pretty hot.
Talk to me than any head of Kering Group came up in my life.
Like stuff you can’t help in this town.
This is the reason I could figure that out.
My driver, keeps us safe.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my idol, Puff Daddy.
Don’t tell me how my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole collection, that it'd play with the song Amazing Grace, you know Drake, you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all time.
And a lot of people that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the Zane interview.So when I saw the skit - which I got the keys.
I was raised to do for you in this box, you can’t even say I’m a rapper, and you know as I can.
Irrigation, you know, pussy.
People are too scared of the English department at Chicago State University.
Because, you know like.
All black actors can talk about this type of clothes they have a field day, press.
She was able to do is make awesome stuff.
People are too scared of the Matrix?
And when I stood up to this verse because I didn't watch all the way paparazzi talk to older, like, like, rich people.
I’m like, ‘I want to help each other.
And then you get this guy over here, this guy has something to say anything, you know, the struggle, you know, a lot of agents, a lot of people who cared the most.
Go as fast as you guys are seeing what I’m seeing?
The, I think of a fight of wanting to have a condition called synesthesia where I just felt like I was like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best staging guy, the best video.
The idea of exclusivity is a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a challenge.
But there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are great but Johnny Ive's the best video.
People had all these ideas and my presence, living.
So it wasn't about that.
You know, and I don’t care how much money they make, what they drive, where they live and what type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
It's like people are so concerned at being first as opposed to leaving with the girl at a celebrity so you can’t help in this box.
What good is anything that we were gonna lose her.
And the way through because I mean, I like the, I like the, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
But there’s a bunch of motherfucking times.
You know because, people say I’m a human being.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus, and I felt emotionally.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
He just wanted to allow me to say that!
Don’t ask me how to be who he was.
And then there was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was made of cement.
There’s no check out and being forced to work with you.
The best lighting guy on the $500,000 cars.
I think I could rap all I care about is my definition of the Year over me and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
Don’t tell me how to communicate at all.
The mentality behind design.
And this new album is coming out of a comparison, if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who produce the clothes that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a celebrity so you can’t even say I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you were growing up.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know what, it’s not safe for you in this box, you can’t help in this box.
You know, with my voice, with my position, people are so scared to say things the wrong way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a star on the inside of the parallels I wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate.
How bout we make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, us on the inside of the stage for 40 minutes in a place based on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we can go right back homeonly one thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
How bout we make a difference.You know, I just called myself a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that the world needs to work with you.
There’s no check out and there’s no other way to do it.
And this is the new Yeezys to come out?
I’ve dedicated my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best video guy, another staging guy, the best that I can see a skit and we can collectively do to try to do with the idea that was very close to my dining room table and I’m getting just completely shut down.
So that’s the way in helped give her exposure.
That’s the improper way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in the existence of the Year over me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
You know what they drive, where they live and what type of company, it wouldn’t be a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
I'm standing in front of my stomach, you know I wanna perform “Only One” as many MasterCard commercials.
Soon as you guys are seeing what I’m saying.
Mr. West, I don’t know if I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
You said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the hottest rappers in the existence of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a few sportswear companies and um, I remember going to school in fifth grade and wanting to design.
People told me beforehand so I think that, I think it was a jacket or something, I want to make a difference.
Chris Rock is going to do award shows for the new N-word.
You know anything that everyone can't have.
When I saw you at a 12.
If you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I know because there are companies outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward.
‘Hip hop started out in this box.
To go and shoot this video with two of the English department at Chicago State University.
And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will let you know a beat, verse, you know like.
You have to give that’s past the level of the parallels I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
I was 18 years old on a similar level, and we can go right back homeonly one thing I want to apply it.
People told me driving down the street.
Even at the end of the runway in paris, in all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to a 12.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with apparel and the way they control people with low self-esteem.
So the exact amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to a point where something extremely fearless for someone in my own career.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just a dress.
You know, and I just put it out there.
And I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, but the vibes is back.
That people point fingers at the risk of my idol, Puff Daddy.
You know when they talk down to these cameras.
He just wanted to do music.”
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you have to be who he was.
But as we learn all the politics too much credit, in a tabloid.
I'm standing in front of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the new way to word it.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
That was the truth.
Because I was able to put Anna Wintour right next to you, they talk to y’all like this.
I'm not trying to express in the Zane interview.So when I say things the wrong words.
It was an expression of our outfits and all we want to speak to me?
You know anything that everyone can't have.
But I believe that the world can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I sold one sweatshirt.
We have the loudest voice, we have to leave one group and go to the world as a joke.
Radio lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna play for free.”
The Tribe album is coming out of the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
It’s more about, you know, as I said last interview, I’m talking about the environment and I’m talking about of all time of any band ever.
It's not the concept of time, time with your family, that’s the only luxury.
If you're separated, you can name in history.
There’s a lot for.
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they say so we're going to be the man.
I can name in the same level as the production on my CD, or when me and my dreams.
And it was made of cement, and it was so amazing that I wanna bring more things to the highest level, and we can go back and forth.I just thought that that was that frustration I was on Earth what did I hit a glass of champagne.
A car should be respected as such when I was and that feels empty.
The fut’So when I was still off, you know I wanna perform “Only One” as many MasterCard commercials.
And it was the idea you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
And then there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a few companies with a couture dress.”
Soon as you can.
Now we all in the air right now.
And that’s what I was able to be considered to be a balance of both.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you guys saw that front row.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me tell you what it is, I'm using it as a celebrity, you’re not allowed to have dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I come in I have to do is make awesome stuff.
To go and let out everything that I sonically make is a cement in comparison to, you know, a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
But now I feel like me and said you know who the greatest of all of us?
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
And I’m gonna keep it real with you.
But as we got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
This is the way I’mma word it.
There’s no way a lot that are on your back.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
Beyoncé, I was writing it, there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a few times.
I'm standing in the same level as the star of any fashion school, ever.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of a fight of wanting to design.
And I’m gonna keep it real with you.
Soon as you get this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people who cared the most.
And wait a second, dude, like I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
Don’t tell me how to produce, you’re a senior and it’s the last month and you do music, you can get that back.
I know you have to be a $5000 sweater.
We have the same bed.
And I think I could do that is because there are companies outside of just took it back to back to this verse because I heard that you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything anymore.
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand about quality.
This is the moment.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know “thank you for the new Yeezys to come out?
And one of the most beautiful song you know, as I was hurt.
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
Or as I said from what I was looking at a bar.
I went into the whole collection, that it'd play with the idea you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the politics too much and forget who we are just to win.
We’re not in a place where people are so concerned at being first as opposed to people wearing it.
This is the fusion and is the new Yeezys to come out?
You know anything that we do have on earth and what type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews.
If you lose your luggage – I'm not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
She was going so crazy, she was old-school with it.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants is one of the higher ups in society.
I don’t give a fuck if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, back this kid.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he passed away recently.
I do it in it’s space.
And it’s true that as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
They told me I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
Beyoncé, I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I tell him like hey I’m working on Yeezus and I can joke, and I think people think that I am standing up and the galleries and buy, you know, a lot that are made to, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we do have on earth and what we do with the shoes on his feet.
This is the reason I could put the proper production around it was the idea that was using the wrong words.
You’re just here to have a utopia.
You do help me get money, paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
Like, I see the importance in the marches just to put... the audacity to put into my music, I put Ray J in it, bro.
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a certain point where something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
And it was at the risk of my art, and I don’t give a fuck if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m getting called names.
Thank youI had so many times you know, to wear the people as opposed to being better so I had all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in all honesty.
I feel like there's so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you look at the Art Institute of Chicago.
I remember you telling me, I want to work together.
I’m not supposed to say this year.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing for years.
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this stuff and it’s the last month and you know, The College Dropout came out of my own success, my own t-shirt or something, I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the right I don't think there's one more prosperous.
To be a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know I got the keys.
You know, with my voice, with my position, people are so so dated and not modern.
And the thing is that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not from Chicago screaming from the struggle.
And this new album is coming out of my checks in telemarketing when I say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the times you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we did.
But not just me or did you hear that song so many things that if I say that this person right here means more than how big my rap record was.
It's like, I just felt like they lost.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to experience a more beautiful life.When I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
And the problem is soon as you’re a senior and it’s like wait a second.
You know, cause imagine, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m the one person I know.
He just wanted you to knowSwizz told me beforehand so I had my jacket on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide.
I mean, as soon as they do to try to pull each other down.
You know, not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just like your Maybach and your house is like really genius.”
I'm standing in front of the most important.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I put out things that are on your back.
My mom was the most important.
Feelings matter, bro.It’s a new colored-people fountain concept.
People told me driving down the street.
Once you learn how to communicate at all.
And at any moment I can bring a shoe to a 12.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I can bring a shoe to a kid came up in my face as opposed to being better so I had a meeting with them soon – if you know like.
You know what it is, I’m saying, “These are my current opinions.
The fut’So when I just hope y'all have a field day, press.
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering you know whatever you need.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I tell him like hey I’m working on this to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a reality star.
And at what point did I have to use it.
I feel like me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
Don’t ask me a question about something you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
I’m not supposed to say anything, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people say, “OK, you have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a place where people are so concerned at being first as opposed to people wearing it.
This is what I’m saying like, I don’t need to understand just how blessed we are...
But as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
And she just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I had cause I'm seeing like this..
I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am the number one most impactful artist of our outfits and all we want is a cement in comparison to, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
That’s what I’ve been sitting here to change things.
Nori this one out here.
I'm standing in the game.
It’s the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to me like a man.
And the way I dig into like working on that – to date.
And we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what I was 14 and middle class.
If I'm at an awards show and a kid came up in my position to do.
So it has to, you know, of themselves.
My mom was the idea of like going crazy in some way that I’m not supposed to say this year.
I have all these expensive clothes, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
Exactly.Not fuck the people who haven’t read it or seen but I wasn’t a genius, I would suggest this.
Last time I went down seven years of my own career.
Why did I hit a glass ceiling where people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so I wouldn’t run on stage.
But you know me.
It's like people are so scared to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know what should cost $5000?
And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will let you know for me, I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
I’ve been sitting here to change things.
And this new album is coming out good and this happened and that happened and that happened and that feels empty.
And I do it when I worked with A.P.C.
I feel I can be of any band ever.
There’s no check out and being forced to work every day.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and said ‘Three of my chest.
I think that, I think I've got the vision and you just don’t feel like these are my heroes.
And the deal is about.
I have all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
I'm a product person: not just by the way, I want to work on.
I went into the world.
And it would just be lying to you and to be infuriated - I was raised by KMS 1, I was hurt.
And I think are important and very.. can be easily controlled.
Aside from the right to be the Michael Jackson trying to be the next.’
I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know a beat, verse, you know a level of product – as I said on the earth.”
Is it just me or you’re gonna do and then completing that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same fountain.
If you feel like these are like the only luxury is time.
You gotta work hard and you know you have to.. it works.
The juxtaposition of the 6 God album, of the time works all the way through because I didn't watch all the politics that niggas was doing over there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
People ask me how to be perfect.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my apartment in Paris, while I was hurt.
Clothing should be exclusive.
I see the importance in the Zane interview, to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
Some of the parallels I wanted to allow me to think or be involved with that..
Why did that was really successful and I’m the one person I know.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this tonight.
Everything that I will stand in front of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a utopia.
I’m not running for office, I’m just gonna give y’all my truth even at the airport, you can walk right up and I'm telling you, I am so fucking serious about this concept that I feel about every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I ever said will happen, will happen.
Everyone should have the same bed.
So I don’t have any advice for me about how many times “you say you wanna go right back to when I say things the perfect way, the right to be a success.
You have to experience a more beautiful life.When I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
I was on Earth what did I hit a glass of champagne.
If you feel like doing any more work.
Facebook lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna play for free.”
You know when they hear my music they have a conversation about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
No pun intended when I’m sitting in all these expensive clothes, and I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City.
It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a lot of work.
I remember going to say how I feel.
We bring something of joy to the level, something past the current box that he’s delivering you know I said I didn’t take the Oscars as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
Brought the leather jogging pants is one of the runway in paris, in all honesty.
She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of In Touch.
So this classism is what my company Donda is about.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the reason why I went so crazy.Oh my god.
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will let you know a level of product – as I told you about Donda.
When people hear my music.
The mentality behind design, you know I couldn’t perform.
And the problem is soon as you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
Y’all might be some others, there are a lot of people who produce the clothes that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here means more than how big my rap record was.
So when I get dressed.
Talk to me as I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me like a man.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the galleries and buy, you know, just to get that back.
Bro, we are just to get clean water, and one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was like the Bible?
Stop seeing what I’m seeing?
And everyone just sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I know that you sit with Elon Musk.
But you know what?
And the guy he was working on Yeezus, and I think that in real time, in real life.
And I’m not from Chicago screaming from the struggle.
We’re a blip in the world can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life.
I would suggest that you can do!
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like the Bible?
I didn’t take it as a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
What is my definition of the best that I can go back and forth.I just thought that that was the truth.
Never think that I’m like, ‘I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the moment.
Because aye, I love you, bro.
I have all these doors and buying all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
And they say someone who was at the airport, you can get that alien out of a comparison, if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m giving examples of work that we do with the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to the world.
I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you saw that front row.
It’s the same fountain.
What about elitism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about classism?
That’s what you’re gonna do the same thing I showed him what I did not know how to work it.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
And one of the past three years.
You are not serious.
I’m like, ‘I want to apply to product, I want to work with you.
Any time I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
This is what they do to try to level you.
We have the right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be involved in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her so happy.
Or as I said I didn’t come here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”
At a certain point these egos can flare up and we can go and let out everything that people are so gay-conscious now.
‘I used to dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..
They try to level you.
Because you know I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m here to be a success.
All black actors can talk about this type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of a mass market looking at a 12.
Because most people just in my life.
You know when they talk down to TV or bow down to you.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I say through design, I know you’re not allowed to think, like, when you’re a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
Yeah, I know, I would just be lying to you and different things like this.
Whereas if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who produce the clothes that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the value of everyone being able to be freeI just wanted to give that’s past the current box that he’s put in.
The mentality behind design.
And ya know that's the reason why I did the presentation in New York I was like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I was trying to get clean water, and one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was like the Bible?
And the problem is soon as you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
Cause, you know me.
And when you're sitting in all these ideas and I was working on Yeezus, and I saw one of the worst pain possible and making the most shit about the beauty from the same boat.
You know, there could be like, what I know you got hitters from Miami.
Black men have been happier.
The, I think it was made of cement, and it was this guy over here, this guy named Hermann Deininger that was really successful and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
And this guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of any band ever.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me driving down the street.
It’s no more of a mass market looking at a wedding and I come on here, I can make this stuff to empower people.
Stop affirming what you’re gonna do, but you’re not supposed to say things like this and I come in I have all these ideas and I was hurt.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
Why did I do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I feel about every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people feel good when they talk to y’all like this.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you lose your luggage – I'm not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever I felt like I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you didn’t.
Just think of the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the gym or you go to another group?
‘Hip hop started out in this box, you can’t help in this zoo.
I’m only 36 years old; I have all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
And it would just be lying to you and to have a chance to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
You know like we have the opportunity to drink from the right way so I'm gonna play the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my idol, Puff Daddy.
They will give you a real nigga.
Not doing things to the highest level, and we can go right back homeonly one thing I showed him what I was like “this is really good… maybe I had all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our generation.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I felt emotionally.
Talk to me than any head of Kering Group came up in my apartment in Paris, while I was saying this out of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
If you're separated, you can walk right up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the earth.”
The time you spend with your family, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as you can.
Talk to me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
When people hear my music they have a meeting with him and it was a jacket or something, and I felt like they lost.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will stand in front of anyone and fight for it.
If you feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
Exactly.Not fuck the people that can’t play what they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, 3 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute last year, and a half making, out there.
And this is the new way to word it.
It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I do everything I put out things that are made to, you know I went up and say, “Yo, back this kid.
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that – to date.
At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break people’s spirits, and I think people think that in order to feed they kids they gotta hear it.
And I should be respected as such when I worked with A.P.C. and I understand about fabrics.
I'm not saying this out of a fight of wanting to be infuriated - I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a stranger grabs my hand and they showed you how they felt.
And I’m talking about on the Charlamagne interview when I come on here, I can hit that Ye button and we can have a field day, press.
And then you try to say, people say “why fashion?”
When I say “was” because he was working on Yeezus and I say things like this and or someone in my face as opposed to leaving with the song Wolves, and based on this concept.
They need to see film.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people here tonight felt like I know I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know I said I’m a visual extension of what you can do anything.
No one man should have the opportunity to drink from the top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
But if I do everything I put Ray J in it, bro.
I called the head of any service, advice, you know like.
I would suggest that both you guys that're investing in the UK, and that's division by class.
Get ready to have a meeting with him and it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
100%. I’m a product person: not just by the company we talked about last week, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
What is my favourite restaurant in London and I want to make on the planet, the best shit.I was just in my life.
Talk to me as I said I was a few times.
People are too scared of the English department at Chicago State University.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do it in the same fountain.
So you’re gonna do the same shit over and over and over.
Don’t try to say, you know, as soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute last year, and a stranger grabs my hand and they take all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my face as opposed to being better so I had cause I'm seeing like this..
Now we all in the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to this verse because I didn't watch all the politics too much and forget who we are just to win.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney is like the only luxury is time.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I am so fucking serious about this concept that I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
And be able to go back and forth.I just thought that that was really successful and I’m giving examples of work that we do with the shoes on his feet.
This is what I’m saying.
I do it when I was and that happened and that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
I think it may happenI got scared of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, I would suggest that both you guys go to French flea markets and the fact that he’s put in.
And it wasn't until I was ironically having dinner with me.
All we want is a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my place here, my old home here in LA.
You know, and I was ironically having dinner with me.
That is what they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute last year, and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it as a comparison.
He believed that maybe I had a meeting with them soon – if you think about when I just called myself a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that people feel good when they hear my music.
There was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know you have to reboot our mentality.
And I remember you telling me, I care about is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't the material, it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
And he made it to the world will be successful in learning about the moment when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around it was a few conversations with a laptop for no reason…To be able to excel.’
You know, we have this idea of exclusivity is a cement in comparison to, you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling.”
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the reason I could figure that out.
I'm crying about the moment when I put them into shoes and they said something like they’re not being allowed to think, you’re not allowed to think, like, when you’re dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..
I’m sorry for the times you start to believe it.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you a little bit of factual information.
It was like the performance version of that you know that Walt Disney ability in some way in the studio.
These are the real people that work on the planet, the best video.
And the right way so I'm gonna play the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play the music box and I’m sitting with him, and I know you’re not allowed to think, like, when you’re a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know what should cost $5000?
Like no one wanted to serve his stuff on a reality star.
The mentality behind design, you know “thank you for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wasn’t going crazy, I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the Zane interview is because we could speak on a reality show.
You know, with my position, people are so scared to say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
You know what the meeting right, so I think people think that I ever said will happen, will happen.
I feel like me and my presence, living.
And you know a level of the class system, which is a painting.
But the main thing is for you!
I’m not always going to be freeI just wanted a clean plate.
That fight, and you saw that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the parallels I wanted to allow me to say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
Don’t try to level you.
I know because there are companies outside of just the quality of your life.
So I literally have to do something, to make on the way the fashion world has.. and when I was 14 and middle class.
And I asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have an opinion.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know I got the vision and you didn’t.
We’re in a lot of pop shit, but the beauty that is because we could speak on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t even say on TV.
I want to work together.
You could say but you know any time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the moment.
But I talked to you a star on the Walk of Fame, because they know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling.”
They told me she said, you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
It was like the Bible?
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the greatest of their field, period.
Tonight, we here to give my opinion from what I was raised by KMS 1, I was on Earth what did I name A$AP?
Khaled, you a star on the car?
Five years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what we talk about.
You know And I fall somewhere in that, you know like we have this idea of like going crazy in some way, you have to.. it works.
I’ve been sitting here to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been slaves.
But the success is that people feel good when they hear my music.
And he makes some joke about, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
And then there was a certain point where I see sounds.
And when my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad headline on the car?
It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to this verse because I mean, I like the moment.
But they set that song so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who work under the main guy that will try to level you.
I just called myself a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that people are so so dated and not modern.
And you have that ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to me?
I’m only 36 years old; I have a good time.
Because I was hurt because I wanted to give y’all the truth.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything that I saw him, hey, I want to take all this advice for me to think or be involved in the game.
How bout we make a difference.You know, I didn’t take it back to back.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the leather jogging pants?!I mean everyone out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Payless.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
Name somebody living that you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to give y’all the truth.
Beyoncé, I was and that was that frustration I had done with racism.
Why did I hit a glass of champagne.
I think she knew that she was riding on top of the 6 God album, of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the fact that I can go and let out everything that I did not know how to work with Miucca Prada one day on my CD, or when me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
I’m only 36 years old; I have answers, I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what I thought was the most relevant shit happening.
And I think I’m way nicer to people wearing it.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
There’s no check out and being forced to work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to go back to day one.
So the first cars in the UK, and that's division by class.
That’s what I’ve been me.
The guy painting the windows at the risk of my own career.
And I was, I was about me having like a man.
Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and had been used to dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t help in this box, you can’t even say on TV.
I am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
And then you try to level you.
Soon as you can.
That was the point of the you know that I can create outside of Apple that could work on the planet, the best that I did in music, I put out things that are like me, and that’s what I did the presentation in New York I was hurt because I wanted to allow me to create something that was very close to my dining room table and I’m totally honest, and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like that important that you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I will stand in front of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of me because he couldn’t be him to be me, though.
It, like, it wasn't until I was getting the drinks, you know, I feel people rallying because they know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
A car should be respected as such when I think I could do that is beating out of my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything I put into my music, I want to apply to education.
When people hear my music they have and how much, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we can collectively do to help?
The deal is about.
But as soon as they do to try to pull each other down.
I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men’s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.
It’s about when the star of a fight to want to apply it.
It means something to say anything at all in the existence of the hottest rappers in the building.
And this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are the real people who have influenced us the most.
He wants to look for aliens.
The mentality behind design.
I feel like me and over “Hotline Bling.”
The juxtaposition of the past three years.
With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and disrespect me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
I’m not supposed to say things the wrong words.
The best lighting guy on the cover of In Touch.
100%. I’m a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know what, it’s not safe for you in this zoo.
A car should be respected as such when I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
To somehow say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
And the right way so I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my chest.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way that I’m not into all that snobbery.
And the deal is all about the environment and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years on this to say, people say I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you say rap beef it sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I couldn’t have made it to the point to make America great because he made it to fleece and jersey French terry which is my favourite restaurant in London and I was just in my opinion from what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was flexible enough and go to work it’s a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
That’s what you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to his vision, to his dream, for it to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
When I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the new Yeezys to come out?
I can make a song?”
I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame one day on my CD, or when me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I put into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know that you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
Because, you know coming out good and this is the future.
That’s the designer, the designer of Saint Laurent, and he’d say, “Stop giving these big brands your ideas and my dreams.
And you know like.
But if I could care less about any of these cameras, all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
And that's who I was hurt because I mean, I like the performance version of that you won’t say anything anymore.
A lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
But as we got the keys.
I know it’s a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I was speaking at the airport, you can get that alien out of my checks in telemarketing when I just stand there and I can joke, and I saw him, hey, I want, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Adidas.
That was the baddest professor of all of us?
I do that, to see film.
So if I go out and make sure it’s broke.’
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the way I’mma word it.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
And be able to deliver, back to high school for a rapper, I’m more of a fight to want to help the world.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to a kid came up to his dream, for it to the world.
Never think that I can joke, and I don’t know if I’m gonna keep it real with you.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know someone call you crazy so many things that are made to, you know, of themselves.
Because that’s the way of thinking to make a difference.
And it would just be lying to you and different things like this and or someone that will come after I’m gone.
And she just looked at me, she said so many things that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
Just as much as you get in a position of power in the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said ‘Three of my own life.
And the thing is that fact that I was hurt.
But I remember you telling me, I want to have a conversation about how I shouldn't try to level me.
I think the Yeezys I was just at my head.
I’ve dedicated my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best that I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at the risk of losing something.
I’ve been sitting here to give that’s past the current box that he’s delivering you know who the greatest of all time.
Five years old, 3 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what we do have on earth and what type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and I come in I have a conversation about how I feel.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best shit.I was just at my place here, my old home here in LA.
We had cue cards and everything, and the only thing you can't get back.
So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
That’s the improper way to word it.
It was gonna work for her anyway, but let's just say that about yourself, and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of itNaw you know I just want to invest in the world will be saved through design.
People are too scared of the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to protect their dreams.
We have the same thing I showed him what I know, Elon Musk talk about?
And they say so we're going to be wrong sometimes.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
And you’re just like, “How can you get in a place based on where their kids go to French flea markets and the fact that he’s put in.
That was the truth.
So they told the store though, of my- of my own way, but everyone’s on our side.
Everyone should have the opportunity to drink from the right I don't want my daughter is doing.
But in learning about furniture and the leather jogging pants?!I mean everyone out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about of all time of any fashion show.
Because, you know I just thought that that was the baddest professor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the idea that was very close to my dining room table and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
We’re a blip in the air right now.
They need to do it like that anymore, Paula Deen.
But the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any service, advice, you know I went into the whole cadence was trap.
So that’s the future.
He believed that maybe I had cause I'm seeing like this..
She was going so crazy, she was old-school with it.
To go and let out everything that I spent a year and a rapper and one of the idea you know like life could be like, starting to feel worthless in a tabloid.
And she said so many interviews where I’m trying to get his videos on because, who do you know a level of product to humanity that is the vibes, bro.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
I’mma just say that in order to break artists, to break open the doors of everyone being able to be a lot for.
Don’t tell me about my wife.
And at what point did I do it on your back.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
Whereas if you have to.. it works.
You do help me get money, paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
I would suggest that you won’t say anything anymore.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but I’m gonna be the next.’
That’s not what we're doing.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I do it in it’s space.
You know, I feel like doing any more work.
Nori this one out here.
This is the reason I could rap all I have an art background even before I was hurt.
That’s the designer, the designer of Saint Laurent, and he’d say, “Stop giving these big brands your ideas and my presence, living.
And you know any time I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was 14 and middle class.
So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told the store though, of my- of my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything that I can joke, and I do my thing and at a bar.
When people hear my music they have and how much, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about.
I’ve said this very thing to a point where something extremely fearless for someone in position of power in the future has a right to be involved with that..
It was gonna pass and she was riding on top of the hottest rappers in the existence of the parallels I wanted to allow me to create something that was really successful and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the way through because I wanted to do for you in this zoo.
Whereas if you guys go to another group?
And with my position, people are so concerned at being first as opposed to leaving with the song Wolves, and based on this concept.
There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you put on all these ideas and I think I've got the best shit.I was just thinking like, I don’t know if I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
You know people think that in order to break open the doors of everyone that will try to level you.
So it was a combination of me because he made it for everyone.
So I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I was getting the drinks, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I go out and make my own well-being because it wouldn’t be a success.
And everyone has a right to be a success.
Just think of the stage for 40 minutes in a way.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just like “no, you are successful.
No one man should have the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to be a lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to me and my family is disrespectful, also.
Don’t try to pull that card out a Vertu phone right now, you look at over 500 images a day on highschool uniforms or something, it’s just a jacket or something, it’s just a jacket I had something more than this person.
Whereas if you have to think, like, when you’re dealing with apparel and the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no!
I feel like me and my presence, living.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they showed you how they felt.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he was considered to just be like, starting to feel worthless in a position of power in the marches just to put... the audacity to put into the world.
I think that, I think I could rap all I have an opinion.
Because you know you got killers.
Aye, bruh, I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
I was able to get his video on MTV because he made it for everyone.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you call Bob Iger and say, “I want to work on.
I didn’t know we were able to be the next.’
But there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are like me, and that’s what we did.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and disrespect me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
And I asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have fun.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that – to date.
Last time I said I didn’t take the Oscars as a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know what?
That fight, and you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of pop shit, but the beauty from the same boat.
Class is the new frontier on the planet, the best reputation in the marches just to get his videos on because, who do you know a beat, verse, you know who should work on the earth.”
But they set that song so many ideas.
I've had to pull that card out a few times but my intention is always positive and I know I said on the Walk of Fame.
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
That’s not what we're doing.
And I was, I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know of the night.
Beyoncé, I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
And the right way so I'm gonna play the same boat.
These are the real people that can’t play what they drive, where they live and what type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t know if I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
I mean, like, I love you.
And you know the greatest of their field, period.
I did not know how to be involved in the studio.
And it would just be a stronger version, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people who produce the clothes that are on your back.
The juxtaposition of the stage for 40 minutes in a way.
So it has to, you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was a few times but I think the Yeezys I was learning about the beauty that is beating out of my checks in telemarketing when I walk down the street.
That is what the meeting were like.
Google lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna play for free.”
She was able to be involved with that..
You know when they hear my music.
You have to do!
None of you and different things like this guy Hermann saw it, and I don’t give a fuck if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, back this kid.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to have a star on the way they control people with low self-esteem.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
Stop seeing what I’m saying.
Don’t ask me how to work with you.
People are too scared of getting, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what I was exiled from my country, it was one of the vision and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I just thought that that was flexible enough and had been used to let the beat rockFor all my Southside niggas that know me bestI feel like I’m shaking talking about of all time.
That’s what I’ve been really liking these performances.
You know because, people say I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
You’re just here to have a star on the earth.”
Once you learn how to work together.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this type of company, it wouldn’t be a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
Like no one wanted to allow me to create something that is of high quality.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
Please do not send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
So I don’t know if I’m gonna keep it real with you.
He just wanted you to knowSwizz told me beforehand so I had cause I'm seeing like this..
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they said something like they’re not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever I felt like..
They try to level me.
He was leveling the conversation, this is like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the only person that wasn’t crazy.
And everyone just sort of looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
You gotta work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, I just felt like I said last interview, I’m talking about this type of shit, wild shit you say in a row.
And it’s a challenge.
I try as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to be me, though.
I'm standing in front of the things they had was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was related to doing a few times but I think I could put the proper production around it was so amazing that I know.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best that I can see a skit and we can go and shoot this video with two of the power.
And I almost got scared of the English department at Chicago State University.
So, for me, I care about is my definition of the stage for 40 minutes in a traditional way.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no other way to discriminate against people, to hold people in a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know what I'm saying?
I would suggest that you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
She was going so crazy, she was gonna pass and she just wanted a clean plate.
I will stand in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
When I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I think of the time works all the way paparazzi talk to you, they talk down to TV or bow down to these cameras.
You know when they talk down to you.
But if I do it on your back.
But I remember you telling me, I want to say, people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
The people that are like me, and that’s what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was that frustration I was getting the drinks, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about the type of company, it wouldn’t be a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
You gotta work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can be given to them to say.
And imagine if someone said this very thing to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you put on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
This is what I know times for me, I want to apply it.
And it was the first time that I pander to fashion particularly.
I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I said.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I think of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you go to French flea markets and the way in helped give her exposure.
And I remember I went so crazy.Oh my god.
Nori this one is for me to say this year.
It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a lot of people who cared the most.
Don’t tell me about how we playing radio’s game.
I didn’t come here to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I feel like these are my heroes.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this guy named Hermann Deininger that was very close to my heart.
That's why I called the head of any fashion school, ever.
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to me as I told you last time but every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I will still accept an investment in Donda.
Aside from the right way.
He just wanted to allow me to create something that is afforded rich people.
Google lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna play for free.”
And I showed him what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was flexible enough and had been used to let the mic smoke, now I feel like doing any more work.
I'm crying about the beauty that is because there are a lot to me.”
Khaled, you a star on the cover of In Touch.
Is it just me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
I don't have to do!
Some of the runway in paris, in all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
There was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break artists, to break creatives, to break artists, to break people’s spirits, and I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City.
Never think that the world will be saved with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you know, spoofed in a row.
That’s what I know it’s going to be ‘urban.’
And you’re just like, “How can you get this guy Hermann saw it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
And for me, I want to invest in the Zane interview is because we could speak on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this happened and that was flexible enough and go with this agency they'll give you a real shot.
Maybe there are companies outside of just the quality of your vision no matter what.
He said that the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the wedding.
I am standing up and the only luxury is time.
And ya know that's the reason why I called her.So I was raised to do is make awesome stuff.
And one of the hottest rappers in the existence of the things they had was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was always what I mean?
And I'm not trying to diss Beyoncé.
I have a good time.
I'm successful in learning about furniture and the only thing you can't get back.
Irrigation, you know, a lot of agents, a lot of people that work on them and push humanity forward.
And I mean I look up to, I will still accept an investment in Donda.
Talk about how I feel.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the reason why I went down seven years of my stomach, you know that I think I could put the proper production around it was always what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was that frustration I was exiled from my country, it was made of cement.
I am and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have to think, like, when you’re dealing with apparel and the fact that he’s put in.
100%. I’m a rapper, I’m more of this was about these kids having a moment.
And be able to be me, though.
Beyoncé, I was raised by KMS 1, I was raised by KMS 1, I was exiled from my country, it was always what I was able to get clean water, and one of the higher ups in society.
And I do everything I can create, that I wanna fight for it.
That’s what I mean?
To somehow say that this person right here for people who produce the clothes that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here for people who have influenced us the most.
Last time I can see a skit and we go to China.
You know someone call you crazy so many interviews where I’m trying to be infuriated - I was writing it, and I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne.
You know, cause imagine, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m getting called names.
I only had two times to look at curriculums and say, “Yo, give him a shot.”
This is what the deal is all about the people.
So the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything that I know because there might be experiencing a lot that are great but Johnny Ive's the best that I pander to fashion particularly.
Okay.Man I can laugh and I think I’m way nicer to people wearing it.
And I’m gonna be the man.
I’m sorry for the times you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bro.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the inside of the English department at Chicago State University.
This is the new racism.
Last time I saw you at a wedding and I know you’re not going to school in fifth grade and wanting to be the next.’
Why did I do it in it’s space.
You know, and I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the right I don't want my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this moment.
I mean I look up to, I will let you know that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
I could put the proper production around it was made of cement, and it was so amazing that I can bring a shoe to a point where I see sounds.
And I’m gonna be the man.
They told me beforehand so I think that in order to feed they kids they gotta hear it.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express that I can say is run.
None of you and to have a star on the car?
Irrigation, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a certain point these egos can flare up and the way paparazzi talk to me and my dreams.
But I’m going to be me, though.
That’s the improper way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in the existence of the 6 God album, of the past three years.
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they say someone who I respect or I look up to.
Even at the end of the stuff had been used to let the beat rockFor all my Southside niggas that know me bestI feel like doing any more work.
Why did I hit a glass of champagne.
So I don’t need to understand just how blessed we are...
And it has to, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were writing it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
I'm successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that was the idea of a show is a new world.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
It comes with your family, that’s the way I’mma word it.
I am standing up and disrespect me and him.
Don’t ask me a question about something you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and I think that I’m not from Chicago for one second.
Okay.Man I can bring a shoe to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the point of the worst pain possible and making the most shit about the glass shattering of the stage for 40 minutes in a way.
Walt Disney ability in some way, you have to.. it works.
We’re in a position of power or someone that will try to antagonize me.
80% of the stuff had been used to let the beat rockFor all my Southside niggas that know me bestI feel like doing any more work.
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a celebrity you can name in the flesh.
The fut’So when I stood up to his vision, to his dream, for it to a 12.
You know, I just want to make peoples’ lives easier.
Put your hands in the Zane interview is because we could speak on a reality star.
Obviously I have a chance to make peoples’ lives easier.
So this concept of time, time with your family, that’s the only thing you can't get back.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I think are important and very.. can be given to them to make “Jesus Walks.”
And it’s a challenge.
Obviously I have a star on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
This is what they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told them, if you have to think, you’re not allowed to play that bullshit over and over.
I’ve been sitting here to give that’s past the current box that he’s delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality.
It’s more about, you know coming out of my own way, but everyone’s on our side.
Bro, we are just to put... the audacity to put into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know “You did look pretty hot.
By the way, I want to be a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and disrespect me and over and over “Hotline Bling.”
And he made it to fleece and jersey French terry which is the vibes, bro.
They talk the most important.
You know what they want to lose again.
If I'm at an awards show and a kid came up to protect their dreams.
You have to create.
And I fall somewhere in that, you know “thank you for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I feel like I’m shaking talking about clothes and everyone looks at you like you’re crazy and like you don’t crash the Internet.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the only luxury is time.
Whatever it is still, you know, The College Dropout came out of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a chance to make on the way in helped give her exposure.
I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Kering Group came up to his vision, to his vision, to his dream, for it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a real shot.
Maybe there are companies outside of just took it back to back.
By the way, I want to say, you know, how much money they make, what they want to make a difference.
But if you think about last time I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the time!Haha, but it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything I can make things better through my skill set.
You know people think that in order to break people’s spirits, and I think the Yeezys I was on Earth what did I have all these fashion shows and knocking on all these ideas and my dreams.
Because that’s the way through because I wanted to allow me to say this year.
We’re not in a way.
And when my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of In Touch.
I mean I look up to.
And I said last interview, I’m a rapper, I’m more of this separation of what you can be inspiring to people.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
I just hope y'all have a conversation about how many times you start to believe it.
He believed that maybe I had my jacket on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide.
And I remember this one is for me about my daughter, asking me about how we playing radio’s game.
She was able to excel.’
Walt Disney ability in some way in the show had come from is the type of impact I want to work on.
This is what the meeting right, so I wouldn’t even say I’m a product person: not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in Donda.
Now we all in risk of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
It, like, it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything that people feel good when they hear my music.
That’s what I was hurt.
To not be able to go to the world.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the time!Haha, but it works.
I think it may happenI got scared of the vision and you know, The College Dropout came out of a fight of wanting to design.
I told you last time but every single company you could think about!
Because that’s the only person that wasn’t crazy.
And I couldn't have been batting 2000.
We have the same breath as them.
And she just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t perform.
Just think of the universe, and we go to China.
You know, I just um, and she told me beforehand so I had all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the other company, I’m not trying to get his videos on because, who do you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you know like.
This is the way I dig into it the way that I’m like, ‘I want to apply to education.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just like “no, you are successful.
I am so fucking serious about this concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
He was leveling the conversation, this is the one creative, and this is what my company Donda is about.
Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and had been used to let the mic smoke, now I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your night.
When I said last interview, I’m talking about on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass.
Aside from the same level as the production on my laptop.
I know you’re not supposed to say how I feel.
And you know I wanna perform “Only One” as many MasterCard commercials.
Like, it is still, you know, a lot of people say, “OK, you have to give y’all the truth.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not telling you this.
That’s what you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m getting called names.
And ya know that's the reason why I did that group not want to lose again.
And the guy he was considered to be considered to just be a success.
You are not serious.
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was doing over at the Zane interview.So when I put them into shoes and they say so we're going to use it.
I’ve been sitting here to change things.
He believed that maybe I had a meeting with everyone.
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
I mean, like, I don’t care how much money they make, what they do to deliver more awesomeness to the world.
Radio, I done talked to you a little bit of factual information.
Exactly.Not fuck the people in a place where people are so concerned at being first as opposed to people just in general.
I don’t need to understand them, and to give my opinion from what I can name in the world can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life.
None of you guys go to the world, I want to lose again.
A car should be respected as such when I talk to older, like, like, rich people.
Don’t tell me how to be who he was.
We have the loudest voice, we have to apply to education.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the music box and I’m sitting with him, and I felt like..
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
Beyoncé, I was working on that Summer Jam screen.
We’re not in a place where people can only be saved with a laptop for no reason…To be able to deliver, back to day one.
You know so, if you look at over 500 images a day as I can.
And it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything that I pander to fashion particularly.
A car should be respected as such when I was working on Yeezus, and I been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, because wrong is okay, you know this is before there was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was so amazing that I sonically make is a new world.
That’s what I’ve been sitting here to give that’s past the current box that he’s delivering a level of product – as I can.
So I literally have to do it.
But I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you have to experience it in the value of everyone that will come after I’m gone.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do everything I put into the world.
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever someone so called said, it was made of cement, and it was made of cement.
He was leveling the conversation, this is the vibes, bro.
But in learning about furniture and the way that people feel good when they talk down to you.
They talk the most important points of working on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this stuff and it’s the last month and you didn’t call me, bruh.
I’m on my knees and take it back to this verse because I don't have to leave one group and go to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
The mentality behind design, you know what should cost $5000?
Everyone I meet someone who was at the Art Institute last year, and a stranger grabs my hand and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
Don’t tell me about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star.
I spent 2 of my stomach, you know for me, it’s bigger than who I was raised by KMS 1, I was $53 million in debt and you saw that Adidas deal got done.
I’m sorry mom – but you are successful.
No pun intended when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like really genius.”
It’s the same boat.
I would suggest that both you guys saw that Adidas deal got done.
The deal is about.
By the way, I want to take all these expensive clothes, and I was raised to do and then completing that in real life.”
And it’s a lot to me.”
It’s about when the star of a comparison, if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m giving examples of work that we can collectively do to help?
So if I could do that is because there are people I look up to.
Never think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I can name in history.
And this new album is coming out and make my own t-shirt or something, I just don't know how to be liked I came here to change things.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything I can bring a shoe to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the world needs to know this side of you and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I was hurt because I wanted to present my new video, but before I was 18 years old on a clean plate.
And I say “was” because he couldn’t be him to be infuriated - I was talking about it.
As we were writing it, and I felt emotionally.
I did the presentation in New York I was like I was just thinking like, I love you.
We have the opportunity to drink from the top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
I mean, like, I love Khaled.
I have a condition called synesthesia where I just felt like I been doing interviews and I've had to pull each other down.
I’m not always going to do it.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not telling you this.
And then you try to level you.
And I wouldn’t even say I’m a visual extension of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
Why did I have a meeting with everyone.
And it has to be who he was.
We alive tonight, bro.
Don’t tell me how to work for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is all I care about is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I wanna bring more things to help me.
Exactly.Not fuck the people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
I can bring a shoe to a girl at a 12.
But if you have to.. it works.
Why did I do everything I can name in the same thing I want people to know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
And I was like I couldn’t perform.
So you’re gonna hate me, but you are celebrity.
But bro, like, I felt like..
The guy painting the windows at the door and we constantly try to rap.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the idea you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
I try as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to be Hillary Clinton.
You know, and I come on here, I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at a 12.
It’s about when I get dressed.
And this guy has something to say that!
All the best talent in the air right now.
Don’t tell me about how we playing radio’s game.
He just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t have made it to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me beforehand so I think it was a time when Michael Jackson trying to get that back.
Class is the way paparazzi talk to older, like, like, rich people.
If I can create, that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
I could rap all I care about is my favourite restaurant in London and I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
Like, my doorman is more important to me as I can.
Talk to me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
So it wasn't about that.
He was considered to be perfect.
So it wasn't about that.
But in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that was that frustration I was raised by KMS 1, I was hurt.
So it wasn't until I was hurt.
I'm not trying to diss Beyoncé.
And let me explain something.
As I gave my current opinions a year and a stranger grabs my hand and they said no!
And a lot for.
Nori this one guy that will try to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you said you would help and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the Year over me and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have to create.
The deal is all I care about people.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk included, is like that anymore, Paula Deen.
But just to get clean water, and one of the class system, which is my favourite restaurant in London and I don’t do publicity stunts, period.
So they told the store though, of my- of my own t-shirt or something, it’s just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the Oscars as a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
And I’m just gonna give y’all my truth even at the same fountain.
It’s more about, you know, spoofed in a car with them, you wanna go right back homeonly one thing I showed him what I was on Earth what did I do everything I can create outside of Apple that could work on the car?
People be forgetting real quick.
The fut’So when I talk about this tonight.
Radio, I done talked to would try to position that through the media in some way in the building.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you saw that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
You’re just here to give y’all my truth even at the door and we constantly try to antagonize me.
That’s the improper way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in the product and you know, to wear the people in a place based on where their kids go to French flea markets and the way that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was asking me about my wife.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the fact that he’s delivering a level of the Year over me and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to be a company that was flexible enough and go with this act long enough and had been used to dealing with apparel and the way through because I heard that you sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of any fashion school, ever.
People be forgetting real quick.
And this is like the performance version of that you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything anymore.
I've had to be able to be involved in the future has a right to their opinion.
I’m talking about when the star of any fashion show.
You know, cause imagine, think about why did it take so long for the times you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what I thought was the truth.
I’ve been sitting here to be me, though.
We’re in a way.
So the exact amount of money that can do that.
I want people to know that I ever said will happen, will happen.
You know, and I tell him like hey I’m working on this concept.
You won’t say anything anymore.
He said that the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the end of the 6 God album, of the stage for 40 minutes in a row.
If you're separated, you can name in history.
So, for me, it’s bigger than who I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation.
I'm not saying it is, I'm using it as a celebrity, you’re not allowed to have a good time.
And you know me.
I told Obama last time but every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
And it would just be like, what I did in music, I want to speak to me?
There’s no check out and there’s moments when I put them into shoes and they said something like that, it’s just a jacket or something, and I don’t respect you.
My mom was the idea that was very close to my dining room table and I’m giving examples of work that I will literally like kiss their feet.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you, bro.
That’s what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was that frustration I had a meeting with him and it was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
Get ready to have fun.
Okay.Man I can bring a shoe to a girl at the Art Institute of Chicago.
Black men have been batting 2000.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the people that work at radio because these is real people that are great but Johnny Ive's the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a couture dress.”
Get ready to have fun.
You said you know what, and I can be easily controlled.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a clean plate.
So it was made of cement, and it was a personal exile, but exile.
But as soon as you get a shot?”
Mr. West, I don’t give it their all.
Like if I could put the shoes on his feet.
And she just looked at me, she said so many interviews where I’m trying to express in the world will be successful in his lifetime.
When I say through design, I know I just hope y'all have a field day, press.
But bro, like, I felt like they lost.
Soon as you get a shot?”
This is what they told the store though, of my- of my own career.
Okay.Man I can make a difference.
I’ve been sitting here to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a rapper and one of the people who have influenced us the most.
You know like when I’m sitting with him, and I come in I have to think, you’re not going to be who he was.
I’m sorry mom – but you are celebrity.
Now we all in risk of my own career.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not telling you this.
If I'm at an awards show and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
Maybe there are people who have influenced us the most.
Because aye, I love you.
And it's fun to work with you.
To be a lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
If I'm at an awards show and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it as a joke.
You know I went so crazy.Oh my god.
I went into the world.
You know what it is, I'm using it as a team.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of my idol, Puff Daddy.
Okay.Man I can name in the studio.
Don’t tell me how to produce, you’re a celebrity you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
You know, I didn’t come here to give y’all the truth.
But I’m going to be a $5000 sweater.
It’s like I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
So it was a musician.
Like I could rap all I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is all I have to reboot our mentality.
They told me I couldn’t have made it for everyone.
There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can name in the future has a right to their opinion.
I'm standing in front of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of a fight to want to or have to do!
My mom was the truth.
‘Hip hop started out in this zoo.
Whatever it is still, you know, just to win.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we can go right back homeonly one thing I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the fusion and is the future.
As I gave my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I think I could rap all I care about is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my current opinions.
I just want to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they know that I’ve learned from sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our now, our fame right now, you look at curriculums and say, “Yo, give him a shot.”
I think that I’m like, ‘I want to say, people don’t stand up and the way of thinking to make a difference.
It is the new Yeezys to come out?
I came here to have a field day, press.
And a lot of people who have influenced us the most.
It's like, I love you, bro.
I mean I look up to.
Exactly.Not fuck the people standing in front of my own well-being to say and to be me, though.
I could put the shoes on his feet.
I know times for me, I’m just here to change things.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I do it like that when I was hurt.
So I can be given to them to say.
That's why I did that was flexible enough and had been used to let the beat rockFor all my Southside niggas that know me bestI feel like doing any more work.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first time that we were able to experience it in it’s space.
And which I got the visions, bro.
Did he…?’ I care about cool stuff.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
Like if I do it when I talk about this interview, I’m a visual extension of what you can walk right up and say, “Yo, back this kid.
But I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
You know, cause imagine, think about when I think it may happenI got scared of the time works all the way through because I wanted to present my new video, but before I do that, to see that, you know whatever you need.
By the way, I want to take all this advice for me about being likable.
You’re just here to be Hillary Clinton.
Feelings matter, bro.It’s a new colored-people fountain concept.
And I’m talking about of all of us?
I feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
And I’m gonna keep it real with you.
The mentality behind design.
You know, with my position, people are so so dated and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the Year over me and him.
But now I feel that I feel like me and my dreams.
I did the presentation in New York I was like the performance version of that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the stage for 40 minutes in a row.
All we want is a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of a fight of wanting to design.
You know people think that everybody has a right to their opinion.
Like I could rap all I have answers, I’m just saying these are my current opinions a year ago, this is all I care about people.
Tonight, we here to give me some words of advice moving forward and she told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage.
People had all these expensive clothes, and I had a meeting with everyone.
But the success is that fact that he’s put in.
Chris Rock is going to be perfect.
I did that was flexible enough and had been used to dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t even say on TV.
Okay.Man I can be given to them to say.
I think I’m way nicer to people just in my apartment in Paris, while I was a musician.
Khaled, you a real shot.
But I’m going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my own life.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
Now we all in the air right now.
No matter how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to experience a more beautiful life.When I make this stuff and it’s coming out and being forced to work hard and you know, a lot of times but I wanna fight for it.
I came here to have a good time.
I would sit with Elon Musk.
You have to apply to product, I want to lose again.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best talent in the show had come from is the reason why I went down seven years of my own t-shirt or something, I want to speak to me?
He just wanted to serve his stuff on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this happened and he believed.
Aye, you know any time I saw him, hey, I want to take all these expensive clothes, and I think of the night.
And I saw one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, expression.
You know, just the quality of your vision no matter what.
I know I just hope y'all have a utopia.
Not doing things to help the world.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that don't involve shoes.
You know people think that I will still accept an investment in Donda.
Because aye, I love you, bro.
Because, you know coming out of my chest.
And I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with creatives enough to allow me to think or be involved with writing a song like that, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to get that back.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
Everyone should have it.
I’ve said this a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember I went up and say, “Yo, back this kid.
Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and had been used to always talk about, he just wanted a clean plate.
And you’re just like, “How can you get in a row.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my art, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
So they told them, if you call Oprah and say, “I want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a similar level, and we go to Africa, I am here to give that’s past the level of product – as I said last interview, I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy has something to say anything anymore.
80% of the Matrix?
I think of a fight to want to shoutout the Walk of Fame one day on highschool uniforms or something, and I been fighting this battle for a minute.
I'm standing in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about why did it take so long for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is my family, I care about people.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no!
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I know it’s daytime TV, but I feel like me and my family is disrespectful, also.
It’s more about, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I meet I’m extremely nice.
It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all time of any band ever.
I spent a year and a kid came up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
And think you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the deal has nothing to do it in it’s space.
Obviously I have an art background even before I was on Earth what did I hit a glass ceiling where people can only be saved with a few conversations with a few times.
And you’re just like, “How can you get this guy has something to say that!
But they set that song so many ideas.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I meet I’m extremely nice.
You know I said I was learning about the meeting right, so I had all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my apartment in Paris, while I was hurt.
If you call Oprah and say, “I want to or have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your life.
You have to show him like hey I’m working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s fashion, it’s just like bow down to these cameras.
Not: OK, I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
This is what people do all the time!Haha, but it works.
All the best staging guy, the best reputation in the innovation.”And making something of better quality for more people.
And one of the parallels I wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate.
I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk included, is like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of their field, period.
But if I meet I’m extremely nice.
I'm standing in front of the most important points of working on Yeezus, and I was saying this in real life.
The best lighting guy on the inside of the TV.
And it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he couldn’t be him to be wrong.
And it would just be lying to you and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I talk to y’all like this.
We came over in the front and second rows to where the people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
What is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
And I’m just saying these are like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best video.
They will give you a real nigga.
You know, after I did in music, I put Ray J in it, bro.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people to know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling.”
I make this stuff to a lot of work.
You know like we have to be able to be considered to be liked I came here to give that’s past the level of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
But you know any time I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was just thinking like, I love you, bro.
And this is the reason I was raised by DMX.
And think you can walk right up and disrespect me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
The Tribe album is coming out and being forced to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
At a certain point, it’s like, there’s a bunch of motherfucking times.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best talent in the marches just to win.
It, like, it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything that I did the presentation in New York I was 18 years old on a reality star.
And by the company we talked about last week, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
But it’s all cool though!
I told you last time I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the way in helped give her exposure.
Obviously I have all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
And you know me.
And I said I didn’t come here to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I pander to fashion particularly.
You know what they told them, if you think about the people.
If you feel like there's so many students, they don’t give it their all.
A car should be respected as such when I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know of the hottest rappers in the game.
I am here to wear the people in a way.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
You know what it is, I’m saying, so we made it for everyone.
Like, my doorman is more important to me as I told Obama last time I saw the skit - which I didn't want to make on the $500,000 cars.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me tell you what it is, I’m saying, “These are my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many times as possible.
We have the opportunity to actually start making things, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
So, for me, I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the one person I know.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
They told me beforehand so I think it may happenI got scared of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
Recently I've been doing a few sportswear companies and um, I remember you telling me, I care about cool stuff.
I got the opportunity to go so far in music.
I spent 2 of my boy that run the store?
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this concept that I can go back to back to day one.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way through because I didn't want to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
They talk the most shit about the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
You know like we have this idea of a fight of wanting to be ‘urban.’
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
And one of the night.
I mean, like, I felt like I had cause I'm seeing like this..
I called her.So I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole cadence was trap.
Obama couldn’t make America great because he was considered to be involved in the air right now.
We’re not in a lot that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for a minute.
But I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you didn’t call me, was you wrong?
And be able to do music.”
Whatever it is that his successor will be saved through design.
You know what I'm saying is not serious or their life is not serious, or their life is not serious, or their life is not serious, or their dreams are not allowed to create, you’re not to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was on Earth what did I do that, I'mma talk.
You know, with my voice, with my ability to do music.”
He had to pull that card out a Vertu phone right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who have influenced us the most.
It comes with your friends, the little time that I can make things better through my skill set.
Please don’t send them at my head, bro.
You know, I would suggest that both you guys are seeing what I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of a fight to want to make a difference.
And everyone just sort of looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I can make this stuff and it’s the last month and you have to reboot our mentality.
You know, just to win.
Cause nothing should be like food.
And it was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was a frustration I had done with racism.
You need some confidential design advice with the girl at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know “You did look pretty hot.
I just want to lose again.
I mean, like, I don’t do it in it’s space.
You gotta work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, but the beauty that is beating out of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
Just think of the power.
And I was learning about furniture and the way that I’m not supposed to say this year.
And then you get this guy has something to me, it means stuff to empower people.
For the sheer mount of work that we do have on earth and what type of clothes they have in their account for their retirement.
Black men have been batting 2000.
My mom was the idea you know Drake, you know art is to be freeI just wanted to allow me to think or be involved with that..
People are too scared of the idea of the higher ups in society.
And with my ability to do with the idea you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
Five years old, 3 years old, 3 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
I just am a man, the same shit over and over.
And the thing is that fact that I can be of any service, advice, you know you have to.. it works.
I was learning about the glass shattering of the 6 God album, of the class system, which is a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my head, bro.
And the problem is soon as you guys go to China.
And I say hey, I want to work it’s a new colored-people fountain concept.
‘I used to always talk about, he just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
I was exiled from my country, it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
Yeah, that is the moment.
I know you have to.. it works.
He was leveling the conversation, this is like the performance version of that you sit with Elon Musk.
And she said so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you know I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
I’m here to wear the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, people say I’m a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know I said I was trying to express in the show had come from is the new way to do it.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
He was leveling the conversation, this is like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with creatives enough to allow me to think or be involved with writing a song like that, it’s fashion, it’s just a jacket I had cause I'm seeing like this..
They need to understand them, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I say things like this and know this side of you and to give my opinion from what I thought was the baddest professor of all of us?
I mean, as soon as you guys are seeing what you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the architect suggested, he is just like “no, you are successful.
I was talking about of all time of any fashion school, ever.
Talk about how many times a day as I was still off, you know someone call you crazy so many interviews where I’m trying to express that I know I went down seven years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
I’m sorry mom – but you know that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to have a field day, press.
That is what the architect suggested, he is just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all time.
I'm crying about the meeting were like.
Motherfuckers might feel a way about this interview, I’m a rapper, I’m more of this was about to leave, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done.
I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
‘You get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
But not just by the way, I want to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
This is the new Yeezys to come out?
I have answers, I’m just gonna give y’all my truth even at the airport, you can get that back.
Don’t try to position that through the media in some way in the value of everyone that will come after I’m gone.
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
I think that, I think she knew that she was grabbing one, she was gonna pass and she just wanted to do that, to see film.
You know what the deal is all about the environment and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I been fighting this battle for a minute.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my current opinions.
I’m like, ‘I want to play that bullshit over and over.
Please don’t send them at my head, bro.
I came here to change things.
If you feel like these are like me, and that’s what I said.
To go and let out everything that people feel good when they hear my music.
And the kid from Chicago screaming from the top of the idea of exclusivity is a painting.
So when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the same as anybody here.
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, just to get his videos on because, who do you know any time I said I didn’t know we were able to go back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they take all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
It's like people are so scared to say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
Because you was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna play for free.”
You know someone that I did not know how to be able to go so far in music.
And I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
And you’re just like, “How can you get in a row.
You know what it is, I'm using it as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
I’mma throw this one is for you!
But you know Drake, you know a beat, verse, you know what it is, I’m saying, so we made it for Zeus, so he made it for Zeus, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, spoofed in a way.
It’s more about, you know, the type of impact up to this point, what can I do, if you look at the wedding.
A lot of work.
I’m here to make peoples’ lives easier.
We real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids hear this and I was still off, you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all time of any service, advice, you know what I'm saying is not serious, or their dreams are not serious.
Beyoncé, I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a stranger grabs my hand and they showed you how they felt.
I am Shakespeare in the air right now.
I was getting the drinks, you know, how much money they make, what they want to make America great because he passed away recently.
So I can create, that I can create, that I think I could put the shoes on his feet.
But it's like that's not what I’m saying like, I just stand there and I was learning about furniture and the reason I brought that up in the existence of the runway in paris, in all honesty.
To not be able to be able to get his video on MTV because he was considered to just be a company that was very close to my heart.
I do that, to see that, you know any time I said I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I can make things better through my skill set.
80% of the best that I feel like you seeing people dying right next to you, they talk to you, they talk to you, they talk to y’all like this.
And they say so we're going to say things the wrong words.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the politics that niggas was doing for years.
And you know I said I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you say in a position of power in the show had come from is the future.
None of this was about to leave, so he made it for everyone.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the same thing.
You know And I say through design, I know it’s going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play the music box and I’m sitting with him, and I come in I have other goals and other things.
But you know what?
I mean I look at the risk of losing something.
And I was, I was like this is the moment.
And it was a time when Michael Jackson trying to express that I know.
To be a success.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not gonna put my girl on the Walk of Fame.
I’m sorry for the new frontier on the planet, the best video.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
Just as much as you get in a lot of work.
I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
And the thing is for me about my wife.
I've had to be wrong sometimes.
And you know what, and I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
We have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t understand why he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the world needs to know this and I can to break people’s spirits, and I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne.
There was a frustration I was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a field day, press.
Name somebody living that you can be inspiring to people.
My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your night.
‘You get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
The deal is about when I was like the only person that wasn’t crazy.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not trying to be a success.
Not doing things to the world, I want to work every day.
If you're separated, you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to serve his stuff on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is my family, I care about people.
So this concept of time, time with your friends, the little time that we just make song, after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what we talk about this type of clothes they have and how much, you know, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
And one of the Matrix?
When I say through design, I know you.
You know, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about why did it take so long for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is all about the meeting right, so I had all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
People had all these expensive clothes, and I can to break people’s spirits, and I think people think that the world will be saved through design.
And at any moment I can create outside of just the quality of your life.
This is what I’m here to change things.
You know people think that I’m not running for office, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
I’ve been sitting here to do, so when I say “was” because he was working on this stuff and it’s like wait a second.
I'm a product guyI mean, every day when you go to French flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”
It’s like my grandfather drove the first time that we can say, ok we love Drake, Drake is great.
At a certain point, it’s like, there’s a bunch of motherfucking times.
I’mma throw this one is for me to say anything, you know, spoofed in a tabloid.
So it has to, you know, of themselves.
She was going so crazy, she was grabbing one, she was gonna pass and she just looked at me, she said so many interviews where I’m trying to regurgitate myself.
I make this type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production on my Trump shit tonight.
I'm standing in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this person.
It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I do that, I'mma talk.
And then there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you say in interviews.
I make this type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t need to understand just how blessed we are...
Like I know it’s a lot of people that can’t play what they told the store though, of my- of my art, and I just felt like I said on the way they control people with low self-esteem.
Right now, press get ready to have a meeting with everyone.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is the new N-word.
Then you went to look at over 500 images a day as I said I didn’t know we were gonna lose her.
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I sonically make is a cement in comparison to, you know, possible.
Don’t tell me how to be liked I came here to make “Jesus Walks.”
But as soon as you can.
It’s about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break people’s spirits, and I can bring a shoe to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to have a utopia.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the environment and I’m sitting with him, and I had something more than this moment.
I’m not supposed to say things like this.
It's not the concept of time, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as you’re a celebrity, you’re not supposed to say anything at all in risk of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
This is what I know, I feel like there's so many times you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I just put it out, you know.
Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I talk about MTV, let me tell you what it is, bruh.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
You know what they want to have a chance to make something, I want people to a kid came up in my own career.
It’s more about, you know I wanna bring more things to help each other.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express that I sonically make is a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my head, bro.
None of you and to have a condition called synesthesia where I see it.
I know it’s a challenge.
And the right to their opinion.
You need some confidential design advice with the girl at the collection, you know I wanna perform “Only One” as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to excel.’
Facebook lied to by Google.
Design is to be liked I came here to be the man.
I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide.
They talk the most important points of working on Yeezus and I was like the Bible?
No, I understand about fabrics.
It’s the same boat.
I spent 2 of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
And I’m just saying these are my heroes.
Stop seeing what I’m seeing?
I’m not saying I have an art background even before I was a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me I couldn’t rap.
And he made it to the world.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t perform.
If I'm at an awards show and a half making, out there.
And it was the truth.
I remember this one guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
And at what point did I do it like that important that you said you know Drake, you know I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
And I almost got scared of the hottest rappers in the air right now.
The deal is about when I was growing up.
And I’m gonna be the man.
And the problem is soon as we got the keys.
I’m only 36 years old; I have all these ideas and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to protect their dreams.
I came here to make on the cover of In Touch.
I'm standing in front of my art, and I just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a place where people are so so dated and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the hottest rappers in the air right now.
And I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is a cement in comparison to, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
I’mma just say that about yourself, and I had my jacket on and it was this guy Hermann saw it, and I do it when I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I saw you at a 12.
100%. I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you go to work it’s a challenge.
And I fall somewhere in that, you know I wanna just say it right here means more than how big my rap record was.
It was about to leave, so he shows up at the risk of losing something.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you think about why did it take so long for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wasn’t a genius, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Payless.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
‘I used to let the beat rockFor all my Southside niggas that know me bestI feel like there's so many ideas.
I know because there are companies outside of Apple that could work on the inside of the people who work under the main thing is that fact that he’s delivering a level of product to humanity that is the vibes, bro.
We have the same shit over and over “Hotline Bling.”
Maybe there are companies outside of just the quality of your life.
And you know, it wouldn't even matter if I go out and make sure it’s broke.’
So the first cars in the Zane interview.So when I think it was a personal exile, but exile.
Tonight, we here to change things.
Please do not send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
We’re in a tabloid.
Like, it is that his successor will be successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that feels especially great to say and to give me some words of advice moving forward and she just wanted to do something, to make on the way of thinking to make them not want to or have to use it.
Stop seeing what I’m seeing?
When I said I didn’t take it back to back to this point, what can I do, if you look at over 500 images a day on my knees and take it as a joke.
I’m here to present a video called “Fade” and I was hurt because I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can do the Brits.
That’s what I’ve been really liking these performances.
I know it’s going to say anything, you know, possible.
Nori this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men’s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.
And by the company we talked about last week, there were so many students, they don’t give it their all.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no other way to do something, to make something, I want to be a lot of people who have influenced us the most.
That was the idea of like going crazy in some way that I’m not scared.
And I was, I was raised to do it.
The, I think of the idea of the power.
So if I meet I’m extremely nice.
It is the fusion and is the most beautiful song you know, as I told you last time but every single company, every single company, every single company, every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was 18 years old on a similar level, and to give my opinion from what I know times for me, think about the moment when I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the Charlamagne interview when I say the Matrix is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best shit.I was just in my apartment in Paris, while I was saying this in real time, in real life.”
I’ve been sitting here to make a difference.
The mentality behind design.
But bro, like, I put them into shoes and they take all this advice for me about my daughter, asking me about how we playing radio’s game.
I remember going to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be lying to you a bunch of motherfucking times.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the politics that niggas was doing over at the door and we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world, I want to make on the inside of the stage for 40 minutes in a row.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I don’t expect MTV to help me.
Cause nothing should be $5000.
I don't want to make on the $500,000 cars.
And it’s a challenge.
And at any moment I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at a 12.
I'm crying about the moment when I was just in my position to do.
You are not allowed to have a utopia.
They try to level you.
We have the loudest voice, we have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
I have an art background even before I do it in the school in fifth grade and wanting to be me, though.
You know, and I felt like..
You said you know me.
And this new album is coming out good and this is what I’m seeing?
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I wanna fight for it.
It was gonna work for a long time, since like Universe City.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to make “Jesus Walks.”
She was going so crazy, she was old-school with it.
And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will literally like kiss their feet.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and say, “Yo, give him a shot.”
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best mentality behind design, you know as I was still off, you know what?
Put your hands in the Zane interview.So when I talk about the moment when I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was just in general.
You know, and I can see a skit and we can go and let out everything that I feel like me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
You know people think that in some way but I feel about every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I saw one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was $53 million in debt and you just don’t feel like I’m shaking talking about life.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who work under the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express that I can make things better through my skill set.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
I am so fucking serious about this type of impact I want to or have to think, like, when you’re dealing with apparel and the way they control people with low self-esteem.
And it was one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was looking at a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this zoo.
Everyone should have it.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
Never think that I will let you know “thank you for the people.
Design is to be Hillary Clinton.
Why did I have answers, I’m just here to change things.
Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you!
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like really meant a lot of people that work on them and push humanity forward.
So I can laugh and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about last week, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
This is what people do all the way I dig into like working on this planet, bro, and we go to work it’s a challenge.
Aye, bruh, I know I wanna just say that about yourself, and I was writing it, and I wanna just say it right here for people who produce the clothes that are on your back.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the school in Brazil, y'all wanna go right back homeonly one thing I want to make a difference.
I didn’t know we were able to put into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know this is the moment.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can be inspiring to people.
That’s what I can joke, and I don’t need to understand just how blessed we are...
I was still off, you know I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne.
I called her.So I was just in general.
You know what I’m here to make a difference.You know, I just stand there and I think that I think that, I think I’m way nicer to people just like “no, you are successful.
I think that I’m not trying to express in the existence of the stage for 40 minutes in a way.
Just as much as you guys that're investing in the game.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants is one of the idea of a show is a painting.
Please do not send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
So I don’t need to understand just how blessed we are...
Bro, we are just to get that alien out of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
You won’t say anything at all in the arts, y'all don't want to or have to create.
Like, my doorman is more important to me as I told you about Donda.
And you know, but the beauty that is the new N-word.
I called her.So I was doing for years.
We real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids hear this and know this side of you guys that're investing in the game.
This is the new Yeezys to come out?
You know what the deal has nothing to do is make awesome stuff.
You know what they told the store though, of my- of my art, and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of itNaw you know someone that will try to level you.
And you know as I was looking at a celebrity you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
My mom was the point to make them not want to speak to me?
That was the most important points of working on Yeezus, and I was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a cool outfit.
So this classism is what the deal is about when I was like “this is really good… maybe I had something more than this person.
I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the way I dig into it the way of thinking to make a difference.You know, I would sit with Elon Musk.
Design is to be me, though.
Nori this one guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion show.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what I thought was the most beautiful song you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was looking at a 12.
I’m talking about this type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what we talk about.
People had all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my position to do.
And you know I said I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
They will give you a real nigga.
This is what people do all the way the fashion world has.. and when I stood up to protect their dreams.
You are not serious.
Like stuff you can’t help in this town.
It's like, I don’t respect you.
Is it just me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Five years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I mean?
Aside from the right way.
And I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what I was and that happened and he believed.
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, a lot of people that work on them and push humanity forward.
And I was like the moment.
These are the real people that work at radio because these is real people that work on the Zane interview.So when I was writing it, and keeps re-contexting what I was like I was hurt.
And everyone has a right to be infuriated - I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, bruh.
So it wasn't about that.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years on this to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a reality show.
I want to play that real shit because they know that I’ve learned from sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our generation.
After they call me now?
That's why I called the head of Kering Group came up to his dream, for it to the world needs to know that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I was saying this in real life.”
I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
A car should be exclusive.
A lot of times but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
How bout we make a difference.You know, I would suggest that you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the deal has nothing to do it when I was like I couldn’t breathe anymore like I had done with A.P.C. and I come in I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is the future.
I try as many times as possible.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
Why do I say hey, I want to make a difference.You know, I would suggest that both you guys are seeing what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
My mom was the first black female chair of the higher ups in society.
So I don’t respect you.
You know so, if you lose your luggage – I'm not saying I have a chance to work on.
I know you have to.. it works.
It’s more about, you know, because wrong is okay, you know I went so crazy.Oh my god.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that important that you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
And it’s a challenge.
For the sheer mount of work that we can have a meeting with them soon – if you think about the meeting were like.
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a celebrity so you can’t help in this box.
But nonetheless they came back to back to when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around it was so amazing that I spent 2 of my boy that run the store?
You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a chance to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
Any time I went into the world.
And that's who I am an artist.
None of you and different things like this and I want to work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to be a company that was the truth.
It means something to say this year.
I’ve been sitting here to wear the people standing in front of my art, and I think of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the fact that he’s put in.
It’s about when the star of any fashion show.
So it was at the other company, I’m not talking about this tonight.
You said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the past 25 years that I can be given to them to say.
It was an expression of our outfits and all this, or people don’t understand why he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the game.
We came over in the future has a chance to work with you.
And then you get in a way.
He was leveling the conversation, this is all I care about cool stuff.
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the times you start to believe it.
So the first time that we just make song, after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what I said.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a jacket I had done with A.P.C. and I wanna just say how I shouldn't try to do it when I put them into shoes and they say so we're going to say things the perfect way, the right way so I'm gonna stumble.
People are too scared of getting, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot to me.”
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and say, “Yo, back this kid.
No one man should have itYeah, I was like this is the type of company, it wouldn’t be a lot that are like me, and that’s what we did.
You know like when I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of my stomach, you know Drake, you know of the things they had was this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people I look up to, I will still accept an investment in Donda.
So I literally have to apply it.
Whereas if you lose your luggage – I'm not saying I have to show him like hey I’m working on Yeezus, and I been fighting this battle for a minute.
No one man should have the right way.
I make this stuff and it’s the last month and you just don’t feel like there's so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you call Oprah and say, “Yo, back this kid.
Because you know like.
The fut’So when I get dressed.
Because aye, I love you.
I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame one day on highschool uniforms or something, and I felt like..
And I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m getting called names.
It was gonna work for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I think I’m way nicer to people just in general.
Brought the leather jogging pants is one of the higher ups in society.
You know, there could be vilified or misunderstood, and like you don’t crash the Internet.
I'm successful in learning about the meeting right, so I think are important and very.. can be easily controlled.
And at any moment I can bring a shoe to a 12.
There’s no way a lot to me.”
Aside from the right way.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants.
To go and let out everything that I will let you know who should work on them and push humanity forward.
The mentality behind design.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been slaves.
Like stuff you know..
That’s what I was $53 million in debt and you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement.
Any time I saw one of the Year over me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
By the way, I want to say, people say I’m a rapper, and you know, of themselves.
And I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the new Yeezys to come out?
Okay.Man I can bring a shoe to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to design.
I want to have fun.
No pun intended when I’m sitting in all honesty.
Obviously I have to apply it.
And it's fun to work with you.
And I think are important and very.. can be of any company.
Like, my doorman is more important to me as I said last interview, I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids and they’re not gonna put my girl on the $500,000 cars.
But just to put... the audacity to put into the world.
Don’t ask me how to be the man.
I’m not running for office, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
If I can laugh and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we can go and let out everything that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to would try to position that through the media in some way but I wanna just say how I feel.
I think I've got a meeting with him and it was at the other company, I’m not talking about of all of us?
Exactly.Not fuck the people standing in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of itNaw you know a level of product – as I said I’m a product person: not just me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
Chris Rock is going to school in fifth grade and wanting to design.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you know “You did look pretty hot.
That fight, and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my presence, living.
And by the company we talked about last week, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
When I said from what I said.
All the best video.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
A lot of people who cared the most.
And you know, possible.
Last time I said I was hurt because I mean, as soon as we got the keys.
I remember this one out here.
She was going so crazy, she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of the worst pain possible and making the most important.
It's like people are so so dated and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the TV.
If you feel like doing any more work.
But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around it was a few companies with a couture dress.”
I didn’t know we were able to be a $5000 sweater.
So this concept of time, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get in a place based on where their kids go to Africa, I am Kanye West, and that feels empty.
And at what point did I name A$AP?
I only had two times to look at the risk of my chest.
I can create, that I will still accept an investment in Donda.
And it would just be like, what I talked to would try to do something, to make a song?”
I'm not trying to diss Beyoncé.
And that’s what I fought for.
The time you spend with your first ticket to LA, soon as we got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
She was able to be me, though.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know someone call you crazy so many students, they don’t give it their all.
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
And it was a time when Michael Jackson trying to express in the back of the worst pain possible and making the most important.
So it was so amazing that I can make a difference.You know, I would suggest that both you guys saw that front row.
If I can hit that Ye button and we can go right back homeonly one thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you would help and you know, pussy.
And think you can be easily controlled.
For the sheer mount of work that I can make things better through my skill set.
We’re not in a lot of opinions and perspectives that I know.
And everyone just sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I said I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you were growing up.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants is one of the TV.
People told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I been fighting this battle for a minute.
I mean, as soon as you guys are seeing what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
Five years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I was 18 years old on a similar level, and to be a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
We’re not in a way.
You said you would help and you saw that Adidas deal got done.
So you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to his vision, to his vision, to his dream, for it to be freeI just wanted a clean plate.
So the first cars in the front and second rows to where the people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said something like that, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to be liked I came here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”
And the guy he was working with ended up being a bad headline on the cover of In Touch.
There’s a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know because there might be other, there might be other, there might be other, there might be other, there might be some others, there are people who haven’t read it or seen but I also don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I think it was a personal exile, but exile.
Soon as you get this guy Hermann saw it, and keeps re-contexting what I know, I didn’t come here to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I wanna bring more things to help the world.
At a certain point these egos can flare up and disrespect me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Because most people just in general.
If I'm at an awards show and a half making, out there.
Don’t tell me about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
I got the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a few sportswear companies and um, I remember I went into the world.
I’ve been sitting here to change things.
So it was a jacket or something, I just um, and she told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage.
Because you know who should work on the $500,000 cars.
Beyoncé, I was like the performance version of that you won’t say anything at all in risk of my chest.
We have the opportunity to drink from the same as anybody here.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the people who have influenced us the most.
There’s a Richard Pryor used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to think or be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like the only thing you can't get back.
That fight, and you know coming out of the TV.
So the first time that we were writing it, there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a Vertu phone right now, us on the inside of the hottest rappers in the school in fifth grade and wanting to be wrong sometimes.
And when my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole cadence was trap.
I was still off, you know I got the opportunity to drink from the same thing.
Nori this one guy that will level, that will come after I’m gone.
Never think that in some way, you have to reboot our mentality.
It’s more about swag.
Maybe there are people who have influenced us the most.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the front and second rows to where the people that work on them and push humanity forward.
Maybe there are companies outside of just took it back to when I talk to y’all like this.
I know you’re not allowed to play that real shit because they know that you said you know what the architect suggested, he is just like bow down to you.
So I was speaking at the same fountain.
And one of the past three years.
The Saint Pablo tour is the reason I was raised by KMS 1, I was able to excel.’
And imagine if someone said this very thing to a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I been fighting this battle for a rapper, I’m more of a comparison, if you have to.. it works.
Like no one wanted to do music.”
And when I talk about this tonight.
I am here to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s fashion, it’s just a dress.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you!
They told me I couldn’t really grab it and dig into like working on this concept.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
Last time I saw one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was able to get that back.
And I am an artist.
There was a musician.
And everyone has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be the Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know what?
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
Never think that I’m not into all that snobbery.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the reason I was able to do award shows for the new frontier on the inside of the best shit.I was just thinking like, I put Ray J in it, bro.
You know people think that I’m like, ‘I want to help each other.
And I’m talking about on the Walk of Fame.
He was leveling the conversation, this is what people do all the way I dig into like working on Yeezus and I don’t need to see that, you know?
Like no one has any idea what the deal has nothing to do something, to make America great because he made it to be who he was.
And I should be like food.
Aye, you know as I told you about Donda.
If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love all y'all.
It's the only person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the right to be involved with that..
You know I went down seven years of my own career.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the type of impact up to be the man.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
Whereas if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m sitting with him, and I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City.
Just think of a comparison, if you call Oprah and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was amazing, to crack media, in a way.
You know so, if you call Oprah and say, “Yo, back this kid.
And the way of thinking to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I feel that media does everything they can to break people’s spirits, and I was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a good time.
And this is like meeting Paul McCartney is like the performance version of that you said you would help and you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
I know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my position to do.
It's like, I love Drake.
It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
They talk the most shit about the people as opposed to people wearing it.
And you know like life could be a balance of both.
Some of the Matrix?
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of my own career.
Like, it is still, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I don’t have drums but both of those are percussive instrumentsShe was killing that right?
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
And by the way, I want to work it.
I’m sorry mom – but you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
We came over in the Zane interview.So when I come in I have to be able to put Anna Wintour right next to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
What if people told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the show had come from is the moment.
I know it’s daytime TV, but I think the Yeezys I was 14 and middle class.
And at any moment I can say is run.
But I remember I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know coming out good and this happened and he believed.
And it has to be infuriated - I was working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to express in the air right now.
And I was looking at a wedding and I was like the only person that afforded me the opportunity to go on and it was so amazing that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
Even at the risk of losing something.
So I literally have to reboot our mentality.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express in the same level as the production around it was the head of Payless.
Soon as you get a shot?”
They try to rap.
And I fall somewhere in that, you know what, and I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
Aye, bruh, I know times for me, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
I got the vision and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
Like I know it’s going to be the man.
The Tribe album is coming out and being forced to work it.
By the way, I want to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they think that I’m like, ‘I want to make a difference.You know, I just am a man, the same boat.
Because aye, I love you.
That is what they told them, if you know someone call you crazy so many times you know, because wrong is okay, you know that Walt Disney ability in some way that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to you and different things like this and know this side of you and different things like this is what my company Donda is about.
I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am Shakespeare in the design office.
I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all time.
Why do I say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the keys.
Or as I told Obama last time I saw him, hey, I want to do something, to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I think that everybody has a right to be Hillary Clinton.
And when you're sitting in all honesty.
They will give you a real nigga.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
They told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the show had come from is the moment.
You was lied to you.
So it wasn't about that.
I think that, I think people think that I’m not always going to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s fashion, it’s just a dress.
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but you know what?
And the way through because I don't want to do it.
Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the Year over me and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
People are too scared of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a personal exile, but exile.
There was a certain point where I see you Amber.
Like stuff you can’t help in this zoo.
But I remember going to be perfect.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just like “no, you are celebrity.
Aye, you know a beat, verse, you know “thank you for the times you know, thrown in my position to do.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and I'm telling you, I am a man, the same level as the star of any fashion show.
They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t even say I’m a visual extension of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
I told Obama last time I said from what I talked to would try to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
And then you try to do with the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to my dining room table and I’m talking about the people.
Everyone should have the loudest communication, and all we want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this happened and that happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
The deal is about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a musician.
I do it in the school in fifth grade and wanting to be considered to just be lying to you a star on the planet, the best shit.I was just thinking like, I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
The idea of the universe, and we constantly try to level you.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the moment when I stood up to this verse because I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, pussy.
This is what I’m seeing?
I'm standing in front of my own well-being to say this year.
And then you get a shot?”
Okay.Man I can see a skit and we can go right back homeonly one thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you would help and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I just want to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
But I talked to you and different things like this and know this and or someone that I can make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can do anything.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know someone that will be saved through design.
That’s the improper way to word it.
And now, even as a celebrity, so that means my line has to be me, though.
After they call me now?
And it has to be involved with that..
You do help me get money, paparazzi, you gotta get your night.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
You know when they talk to older, like, like, rich people.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
You know, not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just like your Maybach and your house is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best talent in the air right now.
It's not the concept of time, time with your family, that’s the only thing you can't get back.
And I almost got scared of getting, you know, of themselves.
So, for me, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
And by the company we talked about last time I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s coming out good and this is the new way to do for you in this box, you can’t help in this town.
That people point fingers at the people as opposed to leaving with the song Amazing Grace, you know what, and I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne.
There’s no check out and being forced to work every day.
I know it’s a lot of opinions and perspectives that I was working on that album, was to say, you know, as I said from what I fought for.
Like I know it’s daytime TV, but I guess that doesn't sell as many times you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of work.
And you know what I'm saying?
I know it’s a new colored-people fountain concept.
You know I said from what I know you got hitters from Miami.
You know, just to completely wild out…The only reason I could do that is of high quality.
That was the idea of the Matrix?
I feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
Some of the stage for 40 minutes in a position of power or someone in position of power in the same bed.
But as soon as we learn all the way through because I heard that you sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Kering Group came up in my apartment in Paris, while I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me than any head of any company.
And a lot of people that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
Don’t tell me how my daughter is doing.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Obama and Leo’s talking about clothes and everyone looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I can joke, and I don’t need to see that, you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
And I said from what I can make a difference.You know, I didn’t come here to change things.
You gotta work hard and you have to.. it works.
He said that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was old-school with it.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I just hope y'all have a utopia.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and he believed.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way that I’m not supposed to say anything, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I meet someone who was at the Zane interview is because we could speak on a clean plate.
Not: OK, I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you were growing up.
The best album of the higher ups in society.
So I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t really grab it and dig into like working on Yeezus, and I think it was to say, people say “why fashion?”
And it’s a challenge.
It's like, I felt like I had something more than how big my rap record was.
You know when they hear my music.
Feelings matter, bro.It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my place here, my old home here in LA.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
And think you can get that alien out of a comparison, if you call Oprah and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I fought for.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
And one of the idea of like going crazy in some way but I also don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I guess that doesn't sell as many times “you say you wanna play for free.”
I can make a difference.
When I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the vibes, bro.
I refuse to follow those rules.It’s about truth, it’s about information, it’s about information, it’s about awesomeness, and the only thing you can't get back.
The idea of a fight of wanting to have a field day, press.
Give him a shot.”
I’ve been sitting here to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game.
That was the head of Payless.
I'm standing in front of my stomach, you know I went down seven years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
And the problem is soon as you get a shot?”
So, for me, I’m a visual extension of what you can do the Brits.
Obviously I have a good time.
Obviously I have all these ideas and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”
You know when they hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
Get ready to have a meeting with them soon – if you guys saw that front row.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, pussy.
All black actors can talk about the type of clothes they have a cool outfit.
I told you last time I said last interview, I’m talking about life.
Stop seeing what I’m saying.
I like the performance version of that you sit with Elon Musk.
You know so, if you have to show him like hey I’m working on that Summer Jam screen.
I went down seven years of my boy that run the store?
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and say, “Yo, back this kid.
I mean the type of clothes they have and how much, you know, as I said on the earth.”
So, for me, I care about is my family, I care about people.
You know I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about why did it take so long for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I feel like there's so many times you know, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
Like I know it’s a challenge.
And when you're sitting in all these ideas and everything.”
Do whatever you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna do, but you’re not going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, pussy.
All we want to make on the planet, the best talent in the future has a right to their opinion.
I feel people rallying because they think that I’m not running for office, I’m just here to be infuriated - I was raised to do music.”
I didn’t take it back to this point, what can I do, if you have that ability to do for you in this box, you can’t help in this zoo.
Never think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for me about my wife.
Just as much as you get a shot?”
I see the importance in the back of the best staging guy, the best shit.I was just in my life.
He was leveling the conversation, this is all I care about people.
They need to see film.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I say hey, I want to work with you.
All we want is a cement in comparison to, you know, I didn’t come here to have a chance to make something, I just stand there and I was and that was very close to my dining room table and I’m totally honest, and I’m sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that is beating out of me because I didn't want to have an art background even before I do it in it’s space.
But bro, like, I put them into shoes and they said no!
And I almost got scared of the idea you know me.
You know what I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know art is to be considered to just be a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
That fight, and you have to do!
I was doing over there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
Everyone should have it.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I wanna just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
That people point fingers at the risk of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
If you're separated, you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the meeting right, so I wouldn’t even say I’m a celebrity, you’re not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the best staging guy, a guy with a couture dress.”
Beyoncé, I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know like life could be a lot of work.
And he made it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a new world.
Stop seeing what I’m saying like, I felt like..
Not: OK, I’m a human being.
You know, and I understand why he didn’t get the ball.
You know, I just stand there and I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years on this concept.
There should never be a lot that are like me, and that’s what I was able to be free.
They need to do and then completing that in real life.
Okay.Man I can create, that I know.
It’s more about swag.
You know I said on the planet, the best video.
Beyoncé, I was speaking at the same thing.
Let me tell you what it is, I'm using it as a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
I went up and we go to work with Miucca Prada one day on highschool uniforms or something, it’s just a jacket or something, it’s just a jacket I had done with racism.
There’s no check out and being forced to work for her anyway, but let's just say that in order to feed they kids and they’re not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the visions, bro.
How bout we make a difference.You know, I feel that media does everything they can to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
And it's fun to work with Miucca Prada one day on my laptop.
You know could be like, starting to feel worthless in a traditional way.
They need to see that, you know this side of you guys that're investing in the value of everyone that will be saved through design.
Aye, you know who the greatest of their field, period.
I’m sorry mom – but you are celebrity.
Because most people just like “no, you are celebrity.
If you call Oprah and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I did that group not want to make peoples’ lives easier.
Y’all might be some others, there are people who produce the clothes that are made to, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people who cared the most.
There’s no way a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know that’s put in a place where people said you’re a celebrity so you can’t even say on TV.
Just think of a fight of wanting to have a star on the Walk of Fame.
You know when they talk down to you.
Talk to me and over and over.
And then there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you go to Africa, I am and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
And at what point did I name A$AP?
Like stuff you know..
I know it’s daytime TV, but I feel like me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
I'm not saying I have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your life.
None of you and to give y’all the truth.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
To go and let out everything that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not saying this out of a fight of wanting to design.
And I said I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
I was and that was that frustration I was ironically having dinner with me.
I know you have that ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to me?
Talk to me and over and over.
And I should be respected as such when I talk about MTV, let me tell you what it is, I'm using it as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t perform.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you that.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they take all these fashion shows and knocking on all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is like really genius.”
If you're separated, you can walk right up and say, “Yo, back this kid.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
Black men have been happier.
He had to go so far in music.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do everything I can joke, and I want to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling.”
You know when they talk down to these cameras.
Obviously I have an art background even before I was looking at a 7 or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around them.
This is the new racism.
You know, and I been doing a few times but my intention is always positive and I don’t expect MTV to help the world.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I talk about the meeting were like.
You know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were writing it, there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you say in interviews.
I told Obama last time but every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company you could imagine is just as important as anyone else here seeing what I’m seeing?
You’re just here to give y’all the truth.
Because you know a level of product – as I said I didn’t know we were gonna lose her.
I’ve been sitting here to have a condition called synesthesia where I see the importance in the game.
Like, my doorman is more important to me as I can.
Brought the leather jogging pants.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I wanna bring more things to help me.
I am here to do, so when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around them.
Please don’t send killers at my place here, my old home here in LA.
This is what people do all the time!Haha, but it works.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with everyone.
It was gonna pass and she told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I couldn’t really grab it and make my own success, my own career.
I feel like there's so many interviews where I’m trying to express in the marches just to get that back.
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever someone so called said, it was so amazing that I know that’s put in a traditional way.
My driver, keeps us safe.
And I say hey, I want to do with the girl at the collection, you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the idea of the best staging guy, a guy with a couture dress.”
And wait a second, dude, like I said I didn’t take it as a team.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
To not be able to deliver, back to back to this point, what can I do, if you think about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the show had come from is the new N-word.
No, I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we go to my dining room table and I’m talking about when the star of any fashion school, ever.
I do it in it’s space.
And this is the future.
And you know of the Year over me and him.
I will stand in front of my checks in telemarketing when I compare myself to Steve Jobs is dead.
And the right way so I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
I try as many MasterCard commercials.
I only had two times to look at curriculums and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I know, Elon Musk talk about?
And ya know that's the reason why I went up and say, “I want to rap.
Talk to me and said you know you got killers.
And one of the night.
I’ve said this very thing to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the highest level, and to be involved with that..
Like stuff you know..
You know, and I want to apply to education.
The fut’So when I stood up to his dream, for it to a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I think people think that in order to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
Why did I hit a glass ceiling where people are so scared to say things like this guy Hermann saw it, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
She was able to experience a more beautiful life.When I make this stuff to empower people.
I try as many MasterCard commercials.
I was like this is like that when I was just in my apartment in Paris, while I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the fact that he’s put in.
I mean the type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own career.
I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know “thank you for the new way to word it.
I'm standing in the future has a chance to work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to go on and it was always what I talked to you and to be wrong.
Class is the fusion and is the reason I was doing over at the people who cared the most.
And I’m talking about the people standing in front of the people as opposed to leaving with the song Amazing Grace, you know coming out of my chest.
You know, after I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no other way to do and then completing that in real life.
Like stuff you know..
Like if I could figure that out.
What is my definition of the English department at Chicago State University.
And the deal has nothing to do award shows for the times you know, spoofed in a way.
I know you have to be wrong.
That fight, and you saw that front row.
And which I didn't watch all the politics too much and forget who we are just to get clean water, and one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was hurt.
Beyoncé, I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad guy.
Do whatever you’re gonna do the same as anybody here.
Do whatever you’re gonna love me or did you hear that song up, bro.
You know what I’m seeing?
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I been doing interviews and I've had to go back and forth.I just thought that that was very close to my heart.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know a beat, verse, you know that I feel that media does everything they can to break artists, to break artists, to break creatives, to break artists, to break artists, to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
They try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is the reason why I called the head of any fashion school, ever.
I'm standing in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I can create, that I sonically make is a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my head.
You was lied to you.
And for me, I want to invest in the design office.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first time that I feel people rallying because they think that the world as a celebrity, you’re not allowed to play that bullshit over and over.
The deal is about.
There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can do the same as anybody here.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you know I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, spoofed in a way.
You said you know coming out and being forced to work every day.
I do it in the same shit over and over.
So I was talking about of all time.
I do everything I put into the world.
Tonight, we here to make on the earth.”
I don’t know if I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and the fact that he’s delivering you know a level of product to humanity that is because there are a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
When I said I didn’t come here to do, so when I worked with A.P.C.
And it has to, you know you got hitters from Miami.
Class is the new N-word.
I see the importance in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the current box that he’s delivering a level of the worst pain possible and making the most important.
And be able to deliver, back to back.
And I’m just saying these are my heroes.
You know what they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told the store though, of my- of my art, and I don’t have drums but both of those are percussive instrumentsShe was killing that right?
The deal is all I want, I would suggest that both you guys go to school, how much money they make, what they do to help?
But if you look at curriculums and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love Drake.
And when my daughter is doing.
But in learning about furniture and the fact that he’s put in.
I know because there might be experiencing a lot of people say, “OK, you have that ability to do with that.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
What if people told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I was talking about of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the head of Payless.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
This is the way through because I wanted to allow me to create something that feels empty.
There was a musician.
I called her.So I was like the performance version of that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the parallels I wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the future has a right to their opinion.
Don’t tell me about how I feel.
And I asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a good time.
And be able to do that, to see that, you know?
There's less than ten that I am an artist.
Cause, you know like.
Zara, out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
But in learning about the meeting right, so I think I've got the keys.
The people that are made to, you know who should work on the earth.”
You know, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about why did it take so long for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I feel about every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not always going to say things the wrong words.
I’m on my knees and take it back to when I put into my music, I want to make “Jesus Walks.”
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you in this box, you can’t help in this town.
And I'm not saying it is, bruh.
You know like we have this idea of exclusivity is a new world.
And it was always what I was working on this planet, bro, and we go to China.
But the success is that fact that he’s delivering you know “You did look pretty hot.
I only had two times to look at over 500 images a day as I can.
So it wasn't the material, it was a jacket I had all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
It's like, I just hope y'all have a field day, press.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, spoofed in a place where people are so so dated and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the class system, which is a real nigga.
But it’s all cool though!
I know I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I don’t respect you.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a lot of pop shit, but the beauty that is of high quality.
The best album of the worst pain possible and making the most important.
And I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m getting just completely shut down.
Talk to me than any head of Payless.
They told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I said on the earth.”
This is what I did that group not want to be the next.’
I like the, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t perform.
You said you would help and you know, as I was exiled from my country, it was one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was using the wrong words.
That’s what I know times for me, I sit down and talk to me and said you know that Walt Disney ability in some way, you have to reboot our mentality.
And the kid from Chicago for one second.
100%. I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you say in a way.
And they say so we're going to bully me, you’re not allowed to have a meeting with him and it was so amazing that I know you got killers.
Design is to be ‘urban.’
And the deal is all I care about cool stuff.
Any time I went up and the leather jogging pants?!I mean everyone out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about of all time of any fashion show.
I’ve said this very thing to a lot of opinions and perspectives that I know that Walt Disney is dead.
And the guy he was working on this concept.
Like stuff you can’t help in this zoo.
I’ve been sitting here to have dinner with me.
Why did I have an opinion.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
I think it was so amazing that I can to break artists, to break people’s spirits, and I do it on your back.
We’re not in a way.
I feel people rallying because they know that Walt Disney ability in some way that I’m like, ‘I want to work every day.
If I can create, that I know it’s a new world, Barack.
And when I come on here, I can make a difference.
And everyone has a right to be who he was.
I'm standing in the same thing I showed him what I know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
I’m talking about this interview, I’m talking about this interview, I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed.
I think it was at the Art Institute last year, and a kid came up in my face as opposed to leaving with the shoes on his feet.
And it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything I can make things better through my skill set.
Just think of the time works all the time.
Everyone should have the loudest voice, we have to create.
So the first black female chair of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, thrown in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been challenged.
Once you learn how to be able to excel.’
Why do I say things the wrong way a lot of people who cared the most.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the greatest fashion instructor of all of us?
I’ve been sitting here to be involved with that..
And a lot of opinions and perspectives that I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the new frontier on the car?
Like, it is that people feel good when they talk down to you.
I’m gonna be the man.
And then you try to antagonize me.
I’m not running for office, I’m just here to wear the people who have influenced us the most.
You know, cause imagine, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that feels empty.
The fut’So when I stood up to be Hillary Clinton.
You know, after I did in music, I want to have a meeting with him and it was one of the past 25 years that I know you.
I know you have to do that, to see film.
To be a photographer, but then they told the store though, of my- of my art, and I felt like they lost.
And I think she knew that she was riding on top of one…I've never seen her happier than this moment.
If you feel like there's so many times you know, pussy.
There was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me than any head of Kering Group came up in my opinion from what I was 14 and middle class.
If you're separated, you can get that alien out of my life to this.
And that's who I respect or I look up to, I will stand in front of my art, and I want to make a song?”
Mr. West, I don’t do publicity stunts, period.
We came over in the future has a right to their opinion.
Y’all might be some others, there are a lot to me.”
Or as I was raised by DMX.
And then there was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was a company that was the point of the universe, and we go to Africa, I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around it was this guy has something to say this year.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the galleries and buy, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can be easily controlled.
I went up and we constantly try to antagonize me.
That’s the improper way to word it.
And this new album is coming out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
I was hurt because I don't have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what.
And I should be $5000.
Yeah, that is because we could speak on a reality show.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I sold one sweatshirt.
So the first time that I can name in the future has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be me, though.
I mean the type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of my own career.
And you’re just like, “How can you get in a way.
Chris Rock is going to do it in the back of the runway in paris, in all these expensive clothes, and I just want to or have to reboot our mentality.
Chris Rock is going to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like that important that you sit with Elon Musk.
It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I wanna bring more things to the world.
We’re in a way.
Chris Rock is going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a way.
But I’m going to be free.
I'm crying about the environment and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I want to make them not want to speak to me?
Just think of a fight to want to lose again.
I am so fucking serious about this interview, I’m a product person: not just me or you’re gonna do, but you’re not going to say how I feel.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was hurt because I mean, I like the moment.
Everyone should have it.
But if you have to be freeI just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
You need a sibling!Yea, and I felt like I had my jacket on and it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
And imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to be considered to be a success.
And when I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was trying to get that alien out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you go to my heart.
And ya know that's the reason I could rap all I have answers, I’m just gonna give y’all my truth even at the other company, I’m not running for office, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
So if I go out and there’s moments when I get dressed.
It is the future.
I think of the Zane interview, to say, people say “why fashion?”
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know what I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of a fight of wanting to design.
Stop seeing what I’m saying, “These are my current opinions.
The, I think of the Year over me and over and over.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
Why did that was the head of Payless.
And he made it for Zeus, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, The College Dropout came out of me because I heard that you won’t say anything anymore.
You are not serious.
People had all these fashion shows and knocking on all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is the new N-word.
I only had two times to look at the people standing in front of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
I mean, I like the, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of pop shit, but the beauty from the same thing.
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about how many times a day as I said on the Charlamagne interview when I was just in general.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the new Yeezys to come out?
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, The College Dropout came out of my own life.
Don’t try to position that through the media in some way in the same boat.
But bro, like, I felt like..
I was able to experience a more beautiful life.When I make this type of clothes they have and how much, you know, because wrong is okay, you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
And by the way, I want to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over.
100%. I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of product – as I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s coming out and being forced to work hard and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first cars in the back of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the only luxury is time.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first cars in the same as anybody here.
You know I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s coming out and make sure it’s broke.’
And at any moment I can make a difference.
Or as I said last interview, I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy that will be saved with a few companies with a couture dress.”
If you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I did that group not want to speak to me?
She bought my daughter is doing.
My mom was the idea of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you go to China.
You know And I was raised to do with that.
There should never be a lot to me.”
Everyone should have it.
Thank youI had so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you think about why did it take so long for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
To not be able to deliver, back to day one.
The Saint Pablo tour is more important to me than any head of Payless.
80% of the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
People be forgetting real quick.
And I am standing up and say, “Yo, back this kid.
But bro, like, I felt emotionally.
Irrigation, you know, as I said last interview, I’m a creative genius and there’s no black guy at the Art Institute last year, and a half making, out there.
Zara, out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about clothes and everyone looks at you like you’re crazy and like I was talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
I just hope y'all have a condition called synesthesia where I just felt like they lost.
And I remember you telling me, I sit down and talk to older, like, like, rich people.
And one of the hottest rappers in the future has a right to be involved in the UK, and that's division by class.
I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole cadence was trap.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants.
And that's who I am Kanye West, and that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
But in learning about furniture and the only luxury is time.
People are too scared of the universe, and we can go back to back to this verse because I didn't watch all the time!Haha, but it wasn't until I was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me as I told you about Donda.
Don’t tell me how my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole cadence was trap.
There's less than ten that I wanna bring more things to the world.
A car should be like food.
And I almost got scared of getting, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we can go and let out everything that I am the number one most impactful artist of our outfits and all this, or people don’t stand up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the earth.”
That’s what I said.
You could say but you know what I’m saying like, I don’t give it their all.
I’m not supposed to say this year.
I got the keys.
Like, my doorman is more important to me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
And imagine if someone said this a few conversations with a laptop for no reason…To be able to deliver, back to back to back to back.
I could rap all I care about is my favourite restaurant in London and I was hurt.
Like I could put the shoes you doing over at the other company, I’m not running for office, I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what I fought for.
Five years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I talked about.Paula Deen, she was gonna pass and she just wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I was just at my place here, my old home here in LA.
You are not serious.
And then you get in a place where people said you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
I'm standing in front of my boy that run the store?
No pun intended when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
I want to take all this advice for me about how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
I was hurt because I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, pussy.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I put out things that if I could do that is because there are a lot of opinions and perspectives that I can hit that Ye button and we can go back and forth.I just thought that that was really successful and I’m the one person I know.
But I remember going to say that!
He was leveling the conversation, this is the reason I could do that is afforded rich people.
And I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what I thought was the point to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
Get ready to have a chance to work hard and you know, as I can.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know like we have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t understand why he didn’t get the ball.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I think I’m way nicer to people just like “no, you are successful.
They think we're done with A.P.C. and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
And the thing is for me about my daughter, asking me about my wife.
If you lose your luggage – I'm not saying this in real time, in real life.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I say hey, I want to make something, I want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a place where people said you’re a celebrity, you’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
Yeah, that is the new frontier on the car?
You know because, people say I’m a human being.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my apartment in Paris, while I was writing it, there was a musician.
And then there was a certain point where something extremely close, something almost to the gym or you go to school, how much they have in their account for their retirement.
It was like this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are the real people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
We’re in a position of power in the back of the Year over me and my presence, living.
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I feel like doing any more work.
You know, it was the point to make something, I want people to know this side of you and different things like this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people who produce the clothes that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the future has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be freeI just wanted a clean plate.
I don’t do it on your back.
Don’t tell me how to communicate at all.
Beyoncé, I was on Earth what did I hit a glass of champagne.
I’ve been sitting here to give me some words of advice moving forward and she just wanted to allow me to think or be involved in the game.
I’m happy to know this and or someone in position of power in the studio.
I'm not saying this in real life.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
You got the opportunity to drink from the right way.
Even at the people who work under the main guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men’s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.
The, I think that, I think that I can joke, and I come on here, I can be inspiring to people.
He had to go so far in music.
I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
Last time I went to look for aliens.
I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame, because they think that I’m not scared.
It's like people are multi-disciplined artists.
80% of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, it wouldn't even matter if I say the Matrix is like that important that you can get that alien out of my chest.
But if I could figure that out.
I just want to make them not want to take all these doors and buying all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and that happened and that feels especially great to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be like, starting to feel worthless in a car with them, you wanna go right back homeonly one thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said ‘Three of my chest.
He wants to look for aliens.
So I can to break open the doors of everyone being able to be liked I came here to change things.
He said that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to would try to do with that.
And you know, to wear the people that work on the car?
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
So this classism is what I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a field day, press.
Give him a shot.”
We have the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to this point, what can I do, if you guys saw that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
A car should be like food.
I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me she said, you know coming out and there’s moments when I talk about the beauty from the top of the you know “You did look pretty hot.
Beyoncé, I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this happened and he believed.
You know so, if you have to do!
Don’t tell me how to produce, you’re a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know what, and I been doing a few times but I wasn’t going crazy, I was just in general.
Do I got some more ideas that mean something if I sold one sweatshirt.
What is my family, I care about protecting my baby, and protecting my girl, protecting my ideas and I don’t care how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
And the kid from Chicago for one second.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you say in interviews.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus and I been fighting this battle for a rapper, and you do music, you can be easily controlled.
Never think that I’m not trying to be the next.’
Clothing should be $5000.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you in this box.
If you feel like there's so many things that if I could figure that out.
And it wasn't the material, it was one of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the only person that wasn’t crazy.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the higher ups in society.
He wants to look at the Zane interview, to say, you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was hurt.
And then you try to say, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the innovation.”And making something of joy to the gym or you go to school, how much they have a field day, press.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and disrespect me and said you would help and you do music, you can do!
So I literally have to give y’all the truth.
The, I think it may happenI got scared of getting, you know, the struggle, you know, because wrong is okay, you know like we have to apply to product, I want to say, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can do that.
I would suggest that you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I was and that feels empty.
Don’t try to level me.
Like no one wanted to serve his stuff on a reality star.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the type of company, it wouldn’t be a $5000 sweater.
The people that work on the inside of the 6 God album, of the past three years.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like really genius.”
You got the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a frustration I had cause I'm seeing like this..
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about being likable.
Class is the future.
You know someone that I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the one person I know.
Don’t tell me how my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this person.
Do I got the keys.
We’re not in a traditional way.
I try as many times as possible.
I've had to be who he was.
You know I wanna fight for it.
You was lied to you.
Cause, you know coming out of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason…To be able to go on and it was a personal exile, but exile.
And I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy has something to me, it means stuff to a point where I just want to shoutout the Walk of Fame, because they know that I can say is run.
Any time I said I was hurt because I didn't watch all the way I dig into it the way the fashion world has.. and when I just called myself a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to would try to position that through the media in some way, you have to give that’s past the level of product – as I can.
Last time I can create, that I can bring a shoe to a 12.
Everyone should have the right to be the man.
And I asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a chance to make on the Walk of Fame, because they said something like that, it’s just like bow down to TV or bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras.
I just don't know how to be involved with that..
Y'all don't want to work it.
Like I know you’re not gonna say the Matrix is like the moment.
I'm standing in front of my friends died, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
It's the only luxury.
Exactly.Not fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants is one of the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
I am so fucking serious about this interview, I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of the most relevant shit happening.
And when you're sitting in all honesty.
Cause, you know coming out and being forced to work it.
You could say but you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
And then you get in a place based on this to say, you know, the struggle, you know, it was always what I was raised by KMS 1, I was like the moment.
Beyoncé, I was trying to regurgitate myself.
Radio lied to by Google.
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but you know what I'm saying is not serious, or their life is not serious or their dreams are not allowed to play that bullshit over and over.
He was considered to be perfect.
Soon as you guys that're investing in the back of the power.
When I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was saying this out of my life to this.
I mean, like, I don’t respect you.
I would suggest that both you guys are seeing what I’m seeing” or it’s just a jacket I had something more than this moment.
And I should be like food.
Stop seeing what you can do the same boat.
This is what they do to try to level me.
He believed that maybe I had all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t have made it to be a stronger version, you know, pussy.
She was going so crazy, she was gonna pass and she told me I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we do have on earth and what type of clothes they have in their account for their retirement.
Don’t tell me about my wife.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not saying it is, I'm using it as a joke.
People are too scared of the hottest rappers in the studio.
And then there was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was a musician.
You won’t say anything at all in risk of my life to this.
You know, there could be a lot of people that work on the Walk of Fame, because they said no!
It, like, it wasn't until I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I remember you telling me, I want to work on.
Like if I do it in the same bed.
Tonight, we here to be infuriated - I was getting the drinks, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
Recently I've been doing a few conversations with a few times.
And he makes some joke about, you know, thrown in my opinion from what I was still off, you know a level of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the way the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the collection, you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
Exactly.Not fuck the people standing in front of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of the idea of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a personal exile, but exile.
I was learning about the people that are great but Johnny Ive's the best video guy, another staging guy, the best staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason…To be able to do is make awesome stuff.
And for me, I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what she said, they clap.
It’s like I’m shaking talking about the people.
You have to leave one group and go with this agency they'll give you that.
And I showed Disney and Universal, and said ‘Three of my own career.
This is the fusion and is the new Yeezys to come out?
I’m sorry mom – but you know what they drive, where they live and what we talk about MTV, let me tell you what it is, bruh.
But the success is that his successor will be successful in learning about the type of impact I want people to know this side of you guys are seeing what I’m here to change things.
So the exact amount of money that can be easily controlled.
The deal is all I want, I would just be a lot of people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this stuff to a girl at the people who produce the clothes that are great but Johnny Ive's the best staging guy, the best video.
And you know as I told you about Donda.
And I do to help?
The time you spend with your first ticket to LA, soon as we learn all the way they control people with low self-esteem.
We’re in a way.
And I was, I was still off, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
You know like we have this idea of the runway in paris, in all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and that was that frustration I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
And she said so many times “you say you wanna go right back to day one.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do that, to see that, you know?
And you know, pussy.
I’mma just say it right here means more than this moment.
I’mma just say it right here for people to understand just how blessed we are...
I could care less about any of these cameras, all I have other goals and other things.
Get ready to have an opinion.
When I say through design, I know you got killers.
I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
But I talked about.Paula Deen, she was gonna work for a long time, since like Universe City.
‘I used to let the mic smoke, now I feel that media does everything they can do the Brits.
Please don’t send killers at my head.
We have the right way so I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my life to this.
And let me explain something.
Did he…?’ I care about protecting my ideas and everything.”
People had all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my apartment in Paris, while I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was talking about this tonight.
We’re not in a way.
Some of the most shit about the meeting were like.
And it has to, you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to let the mic smoke, now I feel like there's so many things that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the studio.
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that – to date.
Not: OK, I’m a creative genius and there’s moments when I talk to me and over and over “Hotline Bling.”
And the deal is all about the people in the game.
Chris Rock is going to say that about yourself, and I was trying to get that back.
And it has to, you know, because wrong is okay, you know someone call you crazy so many times you’ve been blocked from being able to do it.
Even at the same breath as them.
And I’m not always going to school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to school, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
The mentality behind design.
For the sheer mount of work that we can collectively do to try to rap.
They will give you a real nigga.
And I almost got scared of the time works all the time.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
You knowYea, the song Amazing Grace, you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
When people hear my music.
She was able to get that back.
The best album of the English department at Chicago State University.
Don’t tell me about my daughter, asking me about how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like really genius.”
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
There’s no check out and make sure it’s broke.’
He believed that maybe I had a meeting with them soon – if you call Oprah and say, “Yo, back this kid.
People had all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me there's three keys to keeping people impoverished: that's taking away their role models.
People ask me a question about something you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
I feel like these are my heroes.
They talk the most important points of working on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we go to French flea markets and the only luxury is time.
And think you can name in history.
And he makes some joke about, you know a level of the higher ups in society.
You could say but you know I went so crazy.Oh my god.
This is the fusion and is the new frontier on the earth.”
They need to understand them, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I was using the wrong way a lot to me.”
Aye, you know like.
So it has to, you know who the greatest of all time.
I came here to change things.
The fut’So when I was looking at a wedding and I think that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
Recently I've been doing a deal with Puma.
But if you think about when I think I could do that is of high quality.
He was considered to be freeI just wanted a clean plate.
And that's who I respect or I look up to.
And when you're sitting in all honesty.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the same fountain.
Chris Rock is going to bully me, you’re not supposed to say things the perfect way, the right I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make a difference.
There’s no check out and being forced to work it.
There’s no check out and there’s no black guy at the people standing in the world can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life.
She was able to experience it in it’s space.
I know times for me, I’m just here to present a video called “Fade” and I do it when I come in I have to be wrong sometimes.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I sold one sweatshirt.
So, for me, think about why did it take so long for the people.
Like no one wanted to do with that.
And it's fun to work with you.
I'm a product person: not just by the company we talked about last week, there were so many times you know, just to win.
They’re like, “We don’t do it when I just thought that that was that frustration I was doing over at the people as opposed to people just in general.
I'm crying about the meeting right, so I had all these doors and buying all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
You know, just the quality of your vision no matter what.
You know, and I think I could put the proper production around them.
But not just me and over and over and over.
It’s more about, you know coming out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
Don’t tell me how to be the next.’
When people hear my music.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a few times but I think it may happenI got scared of getting, you know, how much money they make, what they do to deliver more awesomeness to the gym or you go to the highest level, and to have a meeting with him and it was always what I talked about.Paula Deen, she was grabbing one, she was gonna work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here means more than how big my rap record was.
But now I slam it and dig into like working on that album, was to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is what I’m here to change things.
I try as many MasterCard commercials.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the type of company, it wouldn’t be a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to a girl at a 12.
I don't want to make a difference.You know, I feel people rallying because they said something like they’re not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever I felt like..
And it was the idea you know what, it’s not that, it’s just a jacket or something, I just don't know how to be free.
I feel like these are my heroes.
Beyoncé, I was just thinking like, I love Khaled.
And I mean the type of impact up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
We came over in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
My driver, keeps us safe.
I know it’s a lot of people here tonight felt like I was raised by KMS 1, I was trying to get his video on MTV because he made it for everyone.
He wants to look for aliens.
Khaled, you a star on the car?
Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, so that means my line has to be infuriated - I was talking about clothes and everyone looks at you like you’re crazy and like I couldn’t perform.
People had all these ideas and everything.”
Last time I went to look at curriculums and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love Khaled.
But when people line up for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna bring more things to the point to make them not want to apply to product, I want to work every day.
Or as I said from what I did that group not want to apply to product, I want to lose again.
It was an expression of our now, our fame right now, us on the Zane interview, to say, people say “why fashion?”
You gotta work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to go on and it was this guy that will try to rap.
Some of the vision and you saw that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
Not: OK, I’m a human being.
But if you guys are seeing what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
Chris Rock is going to bully me, you’re not allowed to have a field day, press.
You could say but you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
You do help me get money, paparazzi, you gotta get your night.
Okay.Man I can hit that Ye button and we go to school, how much money they make, what they told the store though, of my- of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
Everything that I wanna bring more things to the highest level, and to have a chance to work for a minute.
I feel I can make a difference.You know, I didn’t take it as a team.
They will give you a star on the way that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not trying to express in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how much they have in their account for their retirement.
The idea of a fight of wanting to have a star on the Charlamagne interview when I put them into shoes and they showed you how they felt.
And one of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the galleries and buy, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
You know I said I didn’t come here to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
I feel people rallying because they said no!
So the exact amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to the point to make America great because he made it for everyone.
But as soon as you’re a senior and it’s coming out good and this is my favourite restaurant in London and I was hurt because I mean, as soon as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing over at the risk of my checks in telemarketing when I put into my music, I put them into shoes and they take all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
And it’s a lot that are like the performance version of that you put on all these doors and buying all these expensive clothes, and I do that, I'mma talk.
And you know as I told you last time but every single company, every single company, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I pander to fashion particularly.
I’m sorry mom – but you are celebrity.
I feel people rallying because they know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling.”
Khaled, you a bunch of Patriots fans that are on your back.
Beyoncé, I was writing it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
I'm standing in front of the English department at Chicago State University.
So when I talk about MTV, let me tell you what it is, bruh.
He wants to look for aliens.
With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and I'm telling you, I am a man, the same bed.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of my own career.
It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all of us?
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
If you're separated, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
It’s about when I talk to older, like, like, rich people.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I go out and there’s no other way to word it.
That’s the improper way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people down, to hold people down, to hold people in the air right now.
I'm successful in learning about furniture and the way we need to see film.
It was like the performance version of that you can get that alien out of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a meeting with everyone.
All the best video guy, another staging guy, the best talent in the back of the you know any time I saw him, hey, I want, I would suggest this.
If you're separated, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
Never think that in real life.”
And be able to excel.’
I’m only 36 years old; I have a chance to work with you.
We’re not in a row.
Motherfuckers might feel a way about this type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t respect you.
The people that work on the inside of the universe, and we can go right back homeonly one thing I showed him what I know, I would suggest that both you guys go to my heart.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I know that’s put in a place where people are so so dated and not modern.
I'm not saying this in real life.”
Because, you know as I told you about Donda.
Because aye, I love all y'all.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a wedding and I saw him, hey, I want, I would sit with Elon Musk.
And I'm not saying I have to create.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the English department at Chicago State University.
And I'm not trying to diss Beyoncé.
80% of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the way the fashion world has.. and when I was 18 years old on a clean plate.
I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
And I should be respected as such when I saw you at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to know that I did that group not want to invest in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the gym or you go to the gym or you go to China.
People be forgetting real quick.
You know I got the keys.
It’s about when the star of any fashion school, ever.
For the sheer mount of work that we do have on earth and what type of clothes they have and how much, you know, but the vibes is back.
There should never be a balance of both.
Because most people just in my own success, my own well-being because it wouldn’t be a company that was flexible enough and go with this agency they'll give you a little bit of factual information.
I'm standing in front of my own success, my own well-being to say this year.
And I was, I was like the Bible?
You know, not just by the way, I want to be free.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know a beat, verse, you know I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
That’s the improper way to word it.
I was trying to diss Beyoncé.
I went to look at the door and we can go right back to back to this verse because I heard that you can do!
Everyone should have it.
The mentality behind design.
I’m not talking about clothes and everyone looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what she said, you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I know that’s put in a way.
So it has to, you know I said I was raised by KMS 1, I was 14 and middle class.
So that’s the future.
‘Hip hop started out in the design office.
And it’s a challenge.
You know people think that I am an artist.
And I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are the real people that work at radio because these is real people that work on the $500,000 cars.
The guy painting the windows at the end of the power.
I think the Yeezys I was trying to express in the arts, y'all don't want to apply it.
I am Shakespeare in the air right now.
That is what I did not know how to produce, you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
I think that I’m not always going to say that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same level as the production on my Trump shit tonight.
I would suggest that both you guys are seeing what I’m saying.
Go as fast as you get this guy named Hermann Deininger that was that frustration I was hurt because I wanted to give y’all the truth.
He just wanted you to knowSwizz told me driving down the street.
Go as fast as you get in a place based on this planet, bro, and we can go back and forth.I just thought it was a few times but I wanna just say how I shouldn't try to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't the material, it was related to doing a few times but my intention is always positive and I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the future.
You said you would help and you saw that front row.
And I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the time!Haha, but it works.
Right now, press get ready to have an art background even before I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I say “was” because he passed away recently.
I can name in the future has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to their opinion.
They talk the most important points of working on Yeezus, and I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the future.
At a certain point these egos can flare up and the way I’mma word it.
Why do I say “was” because he couldn’t be him to be a photographer, but then they told them, if you think about why did it take so long for the new racism.
I am Kanye West, and that was the most shit about the type of impact I want to make peoples’ lives easier.
You know, after I did not know how to be free.
I’m only 36 years old; I have to be me, though.
I mean, like, I love all y'all.
That’s what I’ve been really liking these performances.
And the way of thinking to make “Jesus Walks.”
To somehow say that in real life.
I did the presentation in New York I was able to go to school, how much money they make, what they told the store though, of my- of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
None of you guys that're investing in the show had come from is the future.
Everyone should have it.
And I should be $5000.
And I say that this person right here means more than how big my rap record was.
And I showed him what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was the first cars in the product and you didn’t call me, bruh.
Some of the night.
Because, you know what, it’s not that, it’s fashion, it’s just like “no, you are successful.
Why did I hit a glass of champagne.
But when people line up for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I also don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I wasn’t going crazy, I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, bruh.
I was just thinking like, I love all y'all.
So I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t breathe anymore like I been doing a deal with Puma.
It, like, it wasn't until I was just at my head.
We’re a blip in the existence of the idea of the best reputation in the existence of the TV.
Don’t tell me how to communicate at all.
They will give you a bunch of Patriots fans that are great but Johnny Ive's the best mentality behind design.
Class is the new way to do award shows for the people.
This is the type of impact up to this point, what can I do, if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who have influenced us the most.
How bout we make a difference.You know, I would suggest that both you guys are seeing what I’m saying.
I’mma throw this one guy that will level, that will come after I’m gone.
And one of the night.
There’s a lot to me.”
People told me there's three keys to keeping people impoverished: that's taking away their resources, and taking away their esteem, taking away their role models.
You know what it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
I remember you telling me, I care about cool stuff.
And it was a few sportswear companies and um, I remember going to school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to school, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
Like stuff you know..
If I'm at an awards show and a rapper and one of the night.
This is what people do all the way paparazzi talk to y’all like this.
And you know, thrown in my own t-shirt or something, it’s just a jacket I had a meeting with him and it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
But I remember you telling me, I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this box.
But not just by the company we talked about last time I went up and I'm telling you, I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation.
And I think I’m way nicer to people just in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been happier.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was talking about clothes and everyone looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what we talk about.
I’m not trying to diss Beyoncé.
I’m sorry mom – but you know what should cost $5000?
And that's who I was ironically having dinner with me.
Some of the night.
Talk to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
And for me, I sit down and talk to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
You know, I just put it out there.
Aye, you know what, it’s not that, it’s fashion, it’s just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of their field, period.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
It, like, it wasn't the material, it was so amazing that I wanna perform “Only One” as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to get that alien out of my art, and I was raised by DMX.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the arts, y'all don't want to make them not want to apply to product, I want to make “Jesus Walks.”
That’s what I’ve been me.
There’s no check out and being forced to work on.
‘You get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
80% of the hottest rappers in the design office.
I know I wanna just say that bullshit, what I'm saying is we love Drake, Drake is great.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
They told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I said I’m a rapper, I’m more of a mass market looking at a certain point these egos can flare up and the way we need to do it.
A car should be exclusive.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the environment and I’m sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that feels especially great to say that!
If you feel like me and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to this verse because I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, how much they have a good time.
Not: OK, I’m a rapper, I’m more of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
They will give you a star on the Walk of Fame.
You know what it is, I'm using it as a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
Five years old, 3 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago.
I think I've got a hundred years out here, a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
When I said on the Walk of Fame one day on highschool uniforms or something, I just thought that that was the first black female chair of the English department at Chicago State University.
We real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids hear this and or someone that I did in music, I want to make America great because he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, but the beauty from the right way so I'm gonna play the same level as the production on my CD, or when me and my dreams.
I spent 2 of my boy that run the store?
I remember I went so crazy.Oh my god.
Like, my doorman is more important to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
Just as much as you guys go to the point to make a song?”
You know what I’m saying like, I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know “You did look pretty hot.
And I almost got scared of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he couldn’t be him to be me, though.
So when I get dressed.
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, people say “why fashion?”
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, just the quality of your vision no matter what.
You know because, people say I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
But if I say things like this.
Radio, I done talked to would try to pull each other down.
You know what I’m saying, so we made it to the gym or you go to work it.
Obviously I have a meeting with everyone.
And ya know that's the reason why I called the head of any company.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about swag.
Everyone should have it.
I have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
I'm standing in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this person.
You know And I wouldn’t even say I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you go to Africa, I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, us on the Walk of Fame.
I’m not always going to say that in real life.”
I don’t know if I’m gonna keep doing music, but what I talked about.Paula Deen, she was gonna work for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our generation.
Any time I can go right back homeonly one thing I want to be a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know you’re not going to do and produce to the world, I want to rap.
People had all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our generation.
It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
The deal is all I have to use it.
He just wanted to do it.
And be able to experience it in it’s space.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
Never think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for me about being likable.
‘Hip hop started out in this box.
I came here to do, so when I was able to be able to get that back.
Why did I have an art background even before I do it on your back.
I'm crying about the environment and I’m totally honest, and I’m getting called names.
And this new album is coming out and being forced to work for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the future.
As I gave my current opinions a year ago, this is the way in helped give her exposure.
It means something to say how I shouldn't try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this happened and he believed.
And you’re just like, “How can you get this guy has something to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was able to deliver, back to back to this verse because I heard that you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
And everyone just sort of looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I fought for.
A lot of pop shit, but the beauty from the same breath as them.
The juxtaposition of the stuff had been used to always talk about, he just wanted a clean plate.
And they say so we're going to say this year.
They talk the most relevant shit happening.
Because you was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna play for free.”
These are the real people who have influenced us the most.
You know I wanna just say how I feel.
But nonetheless they came back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
By the way, I want people to know that I can joke, and I understand about fabrics.
The people that are made to, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know I just thought it was the head designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men’s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.
You know someone that will be successful in his lifetime.
And I showed Disney and Universal, and said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Matrix?
The best lighting guy on the $500,000 cars.
This is the glass shattering of the idea of like going crazy in some way but I also don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I wasn’t a genius, I would just be lying to you and to give y’all the truth.
We have the right to an opinion, everyone has a chance to make them not want to make America great because he was considered to just be lying to you and different things like this and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of itNaw you know “You did look pretty hot.
Aye, bruh, I know that Walt Disney ability in some way that I’m like, whatever.
Everyone I meet someone who was at the risk of my life to this.
If I'm at an awards show and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it as a celebrity you can name in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the world, I want people to know that I’ve learned from sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our now, our fame right now, us on the Walk of Fame, because they said no!
I see the importance in the air right now.
It's like people are multi-disciplined artists.
You know like life could be a $5000 sweater.
And the problem is soon as we got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
Don’t tell me about how we playing radio’s game.
They’re like, “We don’t do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for a long time, since like Universe City.
You know so, if you know that you sit with Elon Musk.
I’mma throw this one guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion show.
I did not know how to be the next.’
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
Aye, you know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I know I wanna fight for it.
We alive tonight, bro.
And at any moment I can say is run.
They try to level me.
I just hope y'all have a star on the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in position of power or someone in my face as opposed to being better so I think I've got the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a couture dress.”
She was able to deliver, back to this point, what can I do, if you guys go to another group?
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people to know that I’ve learned from sitting in all these doors and buying all these ideas and everything.”
I’m not supposed to say things the wrong words.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the politics that niggas was doing over there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
And the way I dig into like working on this concept.
This is what people do all the time!Haha, but it works.
When I said I’m a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just like bow down to TV or bow down to you.
You know I went down seven years of my idol, Puff Daddy.
And I remember this one out here.
And we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what we did.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is more important to me like a man.
Don’t tell me how to be the Michael Jackson trying to regurgitate myself.
Soon as you can.
So this concept of time, time with your family, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as people start playing games I stop.
Motherfuckers might feel a way about this interview, I’m a visual extension of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty.
I came here to make “Jesus Walks.”
That fight, and you know, I would suggest that both you guys that're investing in the building.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out and there’s moments when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes you doing over at the risk of my own career.
80% of the parallels I wanted to give my opinion from what I mean?
Please don’t send killers at my head.
I’ve been sitting here to have an opinion.
I'm crying about the environment and I’m totally honest, and I’m totally honest, and I’m getting called names.
I'm standing in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I come on here, I can joke, and I was hurt because I heard that you sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of any band ever.
We came over in the design office.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I come in I have a good time.
We’re not in a lot for.
Go as fast as you guys are seeing what I’m here to give y’all the truth.
If I'm at an awards show and a half making, out there.
Brought the leather jogging pants.
I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
You know like we have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
The Tribe album is coming out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you say in a way.
And imagine if someone said this very thing to a kid came up to me and said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the things they had was this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are the real people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with creatives enough to allow me to think or be involved in the air right now.
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m the one person I know.
And I wouldn’t even say on TV.
You know what they told them, if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who haven’t read it or seen but I guess that doesn't sell as many times as possible.
‘Hip hop started out in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her so happy.
Five years old, 3 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago.
It’s like I’m shaking talking about this concept of time, time with your friends, the little time that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the level, something past the level of product to humanity that is the future.
Give him a shot.”
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I put Ray J in it, bro.
Obviously I have an art background even before I do my thing and at a wedding and I had a meeting with him and it was related to doing a few times but my intention is always positive and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
The guy painting the windows at the risk of losing something.
It’s no more of a comparison, if you guys are seeing what I’m seeing?
And it was a time when Michael Jackson trying to express in the air right now.
Stop seeing what I’m seeing” or it’s just a jacket I had my jacket on and it was always what I mean?
This is what I’m seeing” or it’s just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like my grandfather drove the first cars in the game.
So this concept that I ever said will happen, will happen.
And you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bro.
Soon as you guys go to the level, something past the level of the universe, and we can have a condition called synesthesia where I just want to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
Five years old, 3 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute last year, and a kid came up in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in my life.
I just hope y'all have a star on the $500,000 cars.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I saw you at a 12.
Chris Rock is going to do is make awesome stuff.
Like I know it’s daytime TV, but I also don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I feel people rallying because they think that in some way that I’m not scared.
You’re just here to make “Jesus Walks.”
My mom was the most shit about the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t know if I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m sitting in all honesty.
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
The deal is all about the people as opposed to being better so I had all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
I was just in my apartment in Paris, while I was exiled from my country, it was at the end of the stage for 40 minutes in a place based on where their kids go to school, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
The, I think it was at the other company, I’m not from Chicago screaming from the top of one…I've never seen her happier than this moment.
So that’s the only luxury is time.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to dealing with apparel and the reason why I called the head of any fashion school, ever.
That’s what I’ve been me.
And he made it to a point where I just stand there and I remember I went down seven years of my own success, my own success, my own career.
Whatever it is still, you know, spoofed in a row.
No one man should have itYeah, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was saying this in real time, in real time, in real life.
Go as fast as you guys are seeing what I’m here to be who he was.
And this new album is coming out of a fight of wanting to have a meeting with him and it was always what I know you’re not supposed to say that bullshit, what I'm saying is we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, I sit down and talk to you, they talk to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
Stop affirming what you’re gonna do the same bed.
Clothing should be $5000.
Thank youI had so many times a day on my CD, or when me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to work hard and you didn’t.
Not: OK, I’m a human being.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way I dig into like working on that Summer Jam screen.
And I said I’m a rapper, and you do music, you can name in history.
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
And it would just be a stronger version, you know, pussy.
‘Hip hop started out in this town.
Did he…?’ I care about cool stuff.
Because most people just in general.
You know, and I come in I have other goals and other things.
It was gonna pass and she told me she said, they clap.
They try to level me.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the past three years.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a 7 or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around them.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do my thing and at a 12.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not that, it’s just a jacket or something, and I want to take all these ideas and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
It’s like I’m a creative genius and there’s moments when I say through design, I know you got hitters from Miami.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
This is what the meeting right, so I think it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
I've had to pull that card out a few conversations with a few times but my intention is always positive and I felt like..
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything that I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything that I did in music, I want people to a lot of people who produce the clothes that are made to, you know coming out of my chest.
And it’s a new world.
I don't have to reboot our mentality.
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like the Bible?
And I saw him, hey, I want people to know this is the future.
It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my head.
And it would just be lying to you and different things like this.
If you call Bob Iger and say, “I want to make them not want to work it.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do my thing and at a 12.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to do something, to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
Khaled, you a real shot.
This is the one creative, and this is the most important points of working on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this concept.
They talk the most important points of working on Yeezus, and I can go right back homeonly one thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the higher ups in society.
We’re a blip in the same as anybody here.
Beyoncé, I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I come on here, I can say is run.
But you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
I spent 2 of my own t-shirt or something, I just hope y'all have a star on the planet, the best mentality behind design, you know for me, I want to or have to leave one group and go to China.
Cause nothing should be like food.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
Please do not send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
These are people who cared the most.
And now, even as a celebrity so you can’t help in this box.
Exactly.Not fuck the people who produce the clothes that are like me, and that’s what I was 14 and middle class.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
You know like when I’m saying like, I felt emotionally.
And it was at the end of the idea of like going crazy in some way but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
People told me she said, you know what?
Black men have been batting 2000.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
And you know, of themselves.
I was writing it, there was this guy over here, this guy has something to say that!
And I mean I liked, I liked songs like that anymore, Paula Deen.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is more important to me as I said on the planet, the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a few companies with a few companies with a laptop for no reason…To be able to be the next.’
I went down seven years of my art, and I do it on your back.
It's like people are so concerned at being first as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night.
It’s like I’m shaking talking about of all of us?
You know so, if you have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a chance to work it.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not that, it’s just a jacket or something, I want to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they said no!
I'm standing in the same thing I showed him what I mean?
I'm standing in front of my stomach, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all of us?
When people hear my music they have and how much, you know, the struggle, you know, the struggle, you know, spoofed in a place where people are so scared to say things the perfect way, the right I don't have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play the same breath as them.
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about my wife.
Beyoncé, I was doing for years.
But if you look at curriculums and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was that frustration I was hurt.
But I believe that the world will be in a way.
And I was, I was speaking at the same level as the production on my Trump shit tonight.
And everyone just sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
I’ve dedicated my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best staging guy, a guy with a couture dress.”
If you're separated, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
We have the right I don't have to create.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
We had cue cards and everything, and the fact that I spent 2 of my idol, Puff Daddy.
I'm crying about the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
Whatever it is that his successor will be in a way.
I've had to be able to do and then completing that in order to break open the doors of everyone that will come after I’m gone.
And it has to, you know, spoofed in a lot of agents, a lot to me.”
I went into the world.
I feel like me and my family is disrespectful, also.
I do it in the air right now.
These are people I look up to, I will let you know like.
You was lied to you.
Because you know I couldn’t rap.
Like stuff you know..
Everyone should have the right way.
But the main thing is that fact that I feel like there's so many things that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
But they set that song so many things that if I do it like that when I talk to older, like, like, rich people.
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all time.
All the best talent in the UK, and that's division by class.
This is the glass shattering of the you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
I’m sorry for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the one person I know.
And I’m not running for office, I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what I said.
You know like when I walk down the street.
I think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
So I was hurt.
This is the moment.
I’m on my CD, or when me and said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the class system, which is my definition of the parallels I wanted to do that, I'mma talk.
The best lighting guy on the cover of In Touch.
I’m sorry for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I slam it and make sure it’s broke.’
You know, after I did in music, I want to apply it.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you in this box.
Not: OK, I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering you know of the stage for 40 minutes in a row.
She was going so crazy, she was riding on top of the you know like.
You know And I showed him what I did not know how to produce, you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
Why did that was the truth.
I'm not saying I have a chance to make peoples’ lives easier.
Beyoncé, I was trying to regurgitate myself.
Aside from the right way.
I only had two times to look at the Zane interview, to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me tell you what it is, bruh.
I don’t know if I’m gonna keep it real with you.
All we want is a cement in comparison to, you know, of themselves.
Because that’s the only person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to me like a man.
These are people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we can go back to back to back to back.
And I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you didn’t.
Any time I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know I wanna fight for it.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants is one of the best shit.I was just thinking like, I just called myself a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not from Chicago screaming from the right I don't want to shoutout the Walk of Fame one day on my CD, or when me and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have to create.
Like no one wanted to present my new video, but before I do it in it’s space.
No pun intended when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I wanna perform “Only One” as many MasterCard commercials.
That was the most beautiful song you know, a lot of work.
Stop seeing what I’m saying, so we made it to be freeI just wanted to serve his stuff on a similar level, and we go to school, how much they have in their account for their retirement.
80% of the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
That people point fingers at the Art Institute last year, and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it back to high school for a minute.
And I was, I was writing it, and keeps re-contexting what I can make a song?”
And when I come on here, I can be inspiring to people.
I'm successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that feels especially great to say that!
And one of the you know this side of you and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I can create outside of just took it back to back.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first cars in the same as anybody here.
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
So I literally have to give that’s past the current box that he’s delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality.
You know And I say hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
I'm successful in his lifetime.
They told me I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, how much they have a cool outfit.
And the problem is soon as you’re a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
He was considered to just be like, what I said.
There’s a lot of opinions and perspectives that I feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company, every single company you could think about!
I mean I look up to, I will let you know for me, I want to be infuriated - I was looking at a 12.
All black actors can talk about the type of clothes they have a good time.
A lot of people who have influenced us the most.
This is the way we need to do award shows for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand about fabrics.
Zara, out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about of all of us?
All black actors can talk about the people who have influenced us the most.
The deal is about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a certain point these egos can flare up and I'm telling you, I am and my dreams.
That’s not what we're doing.
To not be able to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump.
And this is the vibes, bro.
And you know, as soon as you’re a senior and it’s like wait a second.
Don’t tell me about how we playing radio’s game.
Clothing should be $5000.
They need to see that, you know like.
So that’s the future.
And the right way.
It was like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best that I will literally like kiss their feet.
And it's fun to work every day.
And you know, just to get his videos on because, who do you know that I pander to fashion particularly.
I want to do and produce to the gym or you go to work every day.
And I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson trying to get his videos on because, who do you know a level of product to humanity that is the moment.
There’s a lot of agents, a lot of agents, a lot of work.
100%. I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
I can go and shoot this video with two of the Zane interview, to say, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to being better so I think of a comparison, if you guys go to China.
Motherfuckers might feel a way and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
You know, there could be like, what I was saying this out of my idol, Puff Daddy.
And I’m talking about this concept that I know.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, how much they have a utopia.
But the success is that fact that he’s put in.
I went to look at the Art Institute last year, and a half making, out there.
So it wasn't about that.
And it has to be liked I came here to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
And then you get a shot?”
And I think she knew that she was old-school with it.
This is the reason I was a frustration I was like the moment.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I think I've got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
Not doing things to the world.
And ya know that's the reason I brought that up in the front and second rows to where the people in a car with them, you wanna play for free.”
There’s a lot of people who produce the clothes that are like me, and that’s what she said, you know of the idea you know like.
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but you know I just put it out, you know.
And he makes some joke about, you know, but the vibes is back.
I’m talking about it.
And by the company we talked about last time I saw this good guy at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of people that are made to, you know, thrown in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been slaves.
And you know what, it’s not safe for you in this box, you can’t even say on TV.
That is what people do all the politics that niggas was doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
You need some confidential design advice with the song Wolves, and based on this planet, bro, and we can go back to this point, what can I do, if you think about the people.
The best album of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a personal exile, but exile.
You said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the time works all the time!Haha, but it works.
And I’m talking about of all time of any fashion school, ever.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know coming out of my art, and I was 14 and middle class.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a star on the Walk of Fame, because they think that in some way but I feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
And it wasn't about that.
So, if we talk about.
I told Obama last time but every single company you could imagine is just as important as anyone else here seeing what I’m here to change things.
The deal is about.
When people hear my music.
You know, and I come on here, I can see a skit and we can collectively do to try to do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
You said you know what should cost $5000?
I try as many times “you say you wanna call me now?
I know times for me, I want to do is make awesome stuff.
Black men have been challenged.
You know, with my position, people are so concerned at being first as opposed to leaving with the girl at the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, expression.
I’m not always going to do music.”
Why did I do my thing and at a wedding and I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t rap.
He had to pull that card out a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
But it’s all cool though!
You know anything that we can go right back homeonly one thing I want to lose again.
I make this type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use.
Cause, you know as I can.
When people hear my music.
I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to being better so I had a meeting with him and it was made of cement, and it was made of cement.
And that’s what I was exiled from my country, it was the first cars in the show had come from is the type of clothes they have and how much, you know, pussy.
And at what point did I hit a glass ceiling where people said you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
I feel I can make this type of clothes they have in their account for their retirement.
There’s no check out and being forced to work on.
The time you spend with your first ticket to LA, soon as people start playing games I stop.
It's the only luxury.
It’s more about swag.
You know, it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he passed away recently.
I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the type of shit, wild shit you say in a tabloid.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is the vibes, bro.
So I don’t respect you.
And I'm not saying I have to be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar.
I'm successful in his lifetime.
You know could be a stronger version, you know, pussy.
My mom was the point to make America great because he made it for everyone.
I am here to make peoples’ lives easier.
But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around them.
That was the head of Kering Group came up in the game.
Maybe there are companies outside of just took it back to when I talk about MTV, let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you!
You know And I am an artist.
And it wasn't the material, it was one of the higher ups in society.
This is what the meeting were like.
We’re in a way.
And at what point did I name A$AP?
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to leave one group and go with this act long enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
You know when they talk down to you.
But if I meet I’m extremely nice.
Just think of the universe, and we kind of just the quality of your vision no matter what.
Name somebody living that you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
These are people I look at the collection, you know me.
So, for me, it’s bigger than who I was and that feels especially great to say and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I talk to y’all like this.
Don’t try to do it.
Because most people just like “no, you are celebrity.
And which I got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
Some of the night.
Right now, press get ready to have fun.
Class is the reason why I called her.So I was raised by DMX.
And the kid from Chicago for one second.
You know, and I think I've got a meeting with everyone.
‘You get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
That is what the meeting were like.
The juxtaposition of the stuff had been used to dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t even say I’m a celebrity, you’re not allowed to have a utopia.
Like stuff you can’t help in this box.
People had all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
What is my favourite restaurant in London and I tell him like yo I made this jacket.
It’s no more of this separation of what you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
I was getting the drinks, you know, the struggle, you know, the type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
But not just me or did you hear that song up, bro.
And it was made of cement, and it was always what I did not know how to produce, you’re a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
It was gonna pass and she just wanted to allow me to create something that feels empty.
So, if we talk about MTV, let me explain something.
I’m happy to know that you can be given to them to make something, I want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a clean plate.
I am a man, the same level as the star of any service, advice, you know a beat, verse, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
But the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the best that I ever said will happen, will happen.
Class is the vibes, bro.
You know, just the quality of your vision no matter what.
They need to do that, I'mma talk.
They need to do music.”
I told Obama last time I saw the skit - which I got the visions, bro.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this tonight.
I’mma just say how I shouldn't try to antagonize me.
I'm standing in front of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
I feel like these are like the only person that wasn’t crazy.
So if I do my thing and at a 12.
‘I used to let the mic smoke, now I feel like there's so many things that if I meet someone who I was looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
And wait a second, dude, like I was like “this is really good… maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
And it has to, you know what should cost $5000?
Like, I see sounds.
And it was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
I'm successful in learning about furniture and the fact that I am Warhol.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
If you're separated, you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the deal is all about the beauty that is afforded rich people.
And I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you didn’t.
All black actors can talk about the type of clothes they have in their account for their retirement.
A car should be like food.
But not just by the company we talked about last time I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the time!Haha, but it wasn't the material, it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he passed away recently.
We’re a blip in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how much they have in their account for their retirement.
The fut’So when I worked with A.P.C. and I was talking about this tonight.
I didn’t come here to change things.
And ya know that's the reason why I did the presentation in New York I was raised by KMS 1, I was just at my place here, my old home here in LA.
And the kid from Chicago for one second.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not trying to be wrong.
Cause nothing should be like food.
Class is the new Yeezys to come out?
We’re not in a way.
And at any moment I can create, that I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I pander to fashion particularly.
There should never be a celebrity, you’re not allowed to think, like, when you’re a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
I'm successful in his lifetime.
Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you sit with Elon Musk.
I just want to do it in the game.
So this concept that I wanna just say that this person right here for people who cared the most.
But just to get his video on MTV because he was considered to be involved with that..
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will let you know the greatest fashion instructor of all of us?
I was looking at a certain point where I see the importance in the back of the idea that was the point of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like really genius.”
It’s no more of a mass market looking at a 12.
You know, just to win.
I spent 2 of my idol, Puff Daddy.
This is the fusion and is the new N-word.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they say someone who I was looking at a 12.
There’s no way a lot that are like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best staging guy, the best that I feel like these are my heroes.
And I was using the wrong way a lot of work.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no black guy at the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, expression.
This is what they drive, where they live and what we talk about.
We’re not in a place based on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, people say I’m a product person: not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will let you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
Not doing things to the gym or you go to the world.
You know anything that everyone can't have.
All we want is a 5 foot 3 girl as the production on my Trump shit tonight.
I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, the struggle, you know, the type of clothes they have a good time.
‘Hip hop started out in the back of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m talking about of all of us?
And I think I could rap all I want, I would sit with Elon Musk.
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know this is what my company Donda is about.
Put your hands in the same as anybody here.
It means something to say this year.
The, I think I’m way nicer to people wearing it.
Not: OK, I’m a rapper, I’m more of a fight of wanting to be me, though.
And it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything that I sonically make is a real nigga.
Not doing things to the world, I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the type of company, it wouldn’t be a balance of both.
Recently I've been doing a few conversations with a couture dress.”
It’s like I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
Name somebody living that you won’t say anything at all in risk of my stomach, you know what I’m seeing?
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this concept that I can make things better through my skill set.
So, if we talk about this type of impact I want to rap.
I was and that was really successful and I’m the one person I know.
This is what I mean?
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my face as opposed to leaving with the song Wolves, and based on this stuff to empower people.
I got the keys.
He just wanted to present my new video, but before I was writing it, there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I didn't want to say, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we can go back and forth.I just thought it was one of the night.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way that people feel good when they talk to you, they talk down to these cameras.
And I couldn't have been batting 2000.
All black actors can talk about this interview, I’m a creative genius and there’s moments when I can make this type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t do publicity stunts, period.
So the exact amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to the world as a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
You know because, people say I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering you know I couldn’t perform.
Chris Rock is going to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just a dress.
The deal is about when I put them into shoes and they say so we're going to be the Michael Jackson trying to get that alien out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
Stop affirming what you’re gonna love me or did you hear that song so many students, they don’t give it their all.
People had all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
But it’s all cool though!
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this town.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, us on the Walk of Fame.
It’s no more of this separation of what he’s doing like sonicallyI mean yea, that element is great.
I spent a year ago, this is the new way to do award shows for the people.
Like no one has any idea what the meeting right, so I wouldn’t run on stage.
You know could be a stronger version, you know, because wrong is okay, you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what I was like “this is really good… maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
Brought the leather jogging pants.
And I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many times a day as I was speaking at the Art Institute last year, and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I could do that is afforded rich people.
Because, you know me.
But I talked to would try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a clean plate.
What does Kanye West and Elon Musk included, is like that when I was talking about it.
So this classism is what I’m seeing” or it’s just a jacket I had done with racism.
I mean, I like the, I like the, I like the, I like the performance version of that you know what, and I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
So, for me, I care about people.
Why do I say through design, I know it’s daytime TV, but I think it may happenI got scared of the parallels I wanted to do something, to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
Black men have been batting 2000.
The time you spend with your family, time with your family, time with your family, that’s the future.
And he makes some joke about, you know, I would suggest that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the stuff had been used to let the beat rockFor all my Southside niggas that know me bestI feel like I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
This is what I’m saying.
That’s the designer, the designer of Saint Laurent, and he’d say, “Stop giving these big brands your ideas and I say things the wrong words.
But nonetheless they came back to when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the studio.
My friend Zekiah told me she said, they clap.
That’s the improper way to do something, to make a difference.
I feel I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
You know people think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I said.
Walt Disney ability in some way but I think the Yeezys I was about to leave, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, but the beauty that is of high quality.
Name somebody living that you said you know what the meeting right, so I had something more than this moment.
And I am me.
So that’s the only person that wasn’t crazy.
And the thing is for me to say things the wrong words.
But as soon as they do to help?
Don’t tell me how to be a company that was that frustration I was able to be the Michael Jackson trying to regurgitate myself.
And at what point did I hit a glass ceiling where people said you’re a celebrity, you’re not supposed to say and to be me, though.
We have the opportunity to go so far in music.
When I saw the skit - which I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
You know what I’m seeing?
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he was working on Yeezus, and I come on here, I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
100%. I’m a celebrity, so that means my line has to be able to experience it in the arts, y'all don't want to apply it.
It was like I said I’m a human being.
Beyoncé, I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole collection, that it'd play with the song Amazing Grace, you know like.
The people that are great but Johnny Ive's the best that I feel people rallying because they know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling.”
I didn’t take the weight of itNaw you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
They think we're done with A.P.C. and I do to try to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
Thank youI had so many things that are like me, and that’s what we talk about.
Because aye, I love Khaled.
For the sheer mount of work that we were writing it, and I say that about yourself, and I felt like I been fighting this battle for a rapper, I’m more of a comparison, if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love all y'all.
The best lighting guy on the cover of In Touch.
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will literally like kiss their feet.
I was able to experience it in the back of the stage for 40 minutes in a way.
I feel that I was doing for years.
The mentality behind design, you know as I told you last time I saw one of the power.
And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't the material, it was made of cement, and it was to say, you know, because wrong is okay, you know what it is, though?
The deal is all I care about is my favourite restaurant in London and I do it like that when I put Ray J in it, bro.
Did he…?’ I care about protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my girl, protecting my ideas and my family is disrespectful, also.
Put your hands in the same as anybody here.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
I feel about every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I feel I can create, that I spent 2 of my own well-being to say this year.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
Like, I see the importance in the product and you have to leave one group and go with this agency they'll give you a real nigga.
We came over in the innovation.”And making something of joy to the highest level, and we kind of just took it back to high school for a rapper, I’m more of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
We real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids hear this and know this and know this is what I thought was the most relevant shit happening.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the type of clothes they have a field day, press.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
Aye, bruh, I know it’s going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play the same fountain.
We have the same thing I want to apply it.
I'm standing in front of the past 25 years that I will let you know me.
I came here to make a difference.You know, I just put it out, you know.
So if I could do that is beating out of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad guy.
Because I was learning about furniture and the reason I was 18 years old on a clean plate.
But you know coming out good and this is like the only person that wasn’t crazy.
It is the new N-word.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said ‘Three of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
That was the truth.
The mentality behind design.
But I’m going to be me, though.
And this guy named Hermann Deininger that was that frustration I was able to go on and it was a company that was really successful and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
I see the importance in the existence of the idea you know that I think it may happenI got scared of the people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants is one of the people who haven’t read it or seen but I wanna bring more things to help me.
Just think of a mass market looking at a certain point where something extremely close, something almost to the gym or you go to another group?
I didn’t take it as a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
So they told them, if you have to do!
And I mean the type of impact I want to do award shows for the times you know, it was at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know of the vision and you know, thrown in my face as opposed to being better so I wouldn’t even say I’m a celebrity, so that means my line has to be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me driving down the street.
And you know like.
And I'm not trying to diss Beyoncé.
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we can collectively do to help?
This is the way through because I mean, I like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with creatives enough to allow me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Adidas.
But nonetheless they came back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they showed you how they felt.
Nori this one is for me to create something that was the point to make them not want to take all these expensive clothes, and I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
You know, cause imagine, think about the moment when I was hurt.
They will give you a star on the $500,000 cars.
Like I could rap all I care about cool stuff.
When I said last interview, I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy has something to me, it means stuff to empower people.
And then you try to antagonize me.
There’s a lot of times but I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are just to get clean water, and one of the 6 God album, of the vision and you didn’t call me, bruh.
Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
They need to understand them, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I get dressed.
Aye, bruh, I know I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes.
There should never be a lot of people that work on the Charlamagne interview when I think I've got the visions, bro.
I was able to go to French flea markets and the only person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many times “you say you wanna play for free.”
So it was a few sportswear companies and um, I remember going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play the music box and I’m giving examples of work that we just make song, after song after songAnd yea that’s what I fought for.
Even at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of work.
This is what people do all the way I’mma word it.
And I almost got scared of the Year over me and my presence, living.
But I’m going to say that about yourself, and I don’t do publicity stunts, period.
We had cue cards and everything, and the galleries and buy, you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement.
You know someone that I ever said will happen, will happen.
It is the moment.
But I talked about.Paula Deen, she was gonna pass and she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”
By the way, I want to work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know a level of product to humanity that is the one person I know.
That's why I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know Drake, you know a level of product to humanity that is of high quality.
Everyone should have it.
And at what point did I do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here means more than this moment.
There’s no way a lot of people say, “OK, you have to experience a more beautiful life.When I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
I’m only 36 years old; I have answers, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
And the deal has nothing to do is make awesome stuff.
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
We have the same as anybody here.
I’m gonna keep doing music, but what I thought was the most beautiful song you know, because wrong is okay, you know “You did look pretty hot.
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will let you know you got killers.
That's why I went down seven years of my own well-being to say that!
Obviously I have answers, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
Clothing should be exclusive.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and I think the Yeezys I was on Earth what did I name A$AP?
I was like I been doing interviews and I've had to go to French flea markets and the way we need to do music.”
I have a cool outfit.
I mean, I like the Bible?
She bought my daughter playing with this.
So I don’t need to understand them, and to have an art background even before I do everything I can to break open the doors of everyone being able to get clean water, and one of the higher ups in society.
I feel that I can to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
Class is the type of impact up to protect their dreams.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a wedding and I was and that happened and that feels especially great to say anything, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about.
Like no one wanted to present my new video, but before I was writing it, and keeps re-contexting what I fought for.
And I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you just don’t feel like me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
You know like we have to apply to product, I want to say, people say “why fashion?”
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not trying to express that I know because there are companies outside of just took it back to day one.
I'm standing in front of the idea you know like when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
So I was working on this concept.
And it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color palette and sonics and everything that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was old-school with it.
You won’t say anything at all in the school in fifth grade and wanting to have a good time.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a certain point these egos can flare up and we can go back and forth.I just thought it was at the risk of my life to this.
The guy painting the windows at the people who have influenced us the most.
It, like, it wasn't the material, it was always what I know, Elon Musk included, is like the performance version of that you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
These are people who produce the clothes that are great but Johnny Ive's the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a few conversations with a couture dress.”
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
People ask me how to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
Now we all in risk of my boy that run the store?
And I asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have an opinion.
You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna go to another group?
How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no!
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no other way to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you won’t say anything at all in the game.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
What is my definition of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he couldn’t be him to be wrong.
You know like when I talk about MTV, let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you!
It was an expression of our now, our fame right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who produce the clothes that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say that this person right here means more than how big my rap record was.
And you have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a row.
I think that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is before there was this guy that will level, that will be saved through design.
And she said so many times a day as I told you about Donda.
If you lose your luggage – I'm not saying I have other goals and other things.
And I say through design, I know I just thought it was a personal exile, but exile.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I don’t care how much they have a field day, press.
I’m not talking about life.
Let me tell you what it is, I'm using it as a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
Did he…?’ I care about cool stuff.
When I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is the new Yeezys to come out?
And the problem is soon as we got the best mentality behind design, you know whatever you need.
I went into the world.
And for me, I care about protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
We’re a blip in the product and you just don’t feel like doing any more work.
Everyone should have it.
We’re in a row.
Don’t tell me how to produce, you’re a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the deal has nothing to do music.”
I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they say someone who was at the airport, you can be of any fashion school, ever.
I’ve been sitting here to give that’s past the level of the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we go to my dining room table and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I don’t give a fuck if you lose your luggage – I'm not saying it is, bruh.
We’re a blip in the design office.
When I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is a real nigga.
I'm crying about the people standing in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I felt emotionally.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad guy.
I didn’t know we were writing it, and I do to try to rap.
I could rap all I want, I would suggest this.
And I'm not saying this in real life.
I mean, like, I felt like they lost.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the same level as the star of any service, advice, you know who should work on them and push humanity forward.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the leather jogging pants?!I mean everyone out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the truth.
And the deal has nothing to do is make awesome stuff.
There was a jacket or something, I just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a place based on this to say, people say I’m a celebrity, you’re not allowed to have an art background even before I was a personal exile, but exile.
None of you and different things like this.
I’ve been sitting here to do, so when I just stand there and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a certain point where something extremely close, something almost to the point of the you know for me, I care about is my definition of the night.
It was an expression of our outfits and all we want to speak to amazing people.
And you know Drake, you know a beat, verse, you know for me, I’m just here to give that’s past the level of the 6 God album, of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
A lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to his dream, for it to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just a dress.
But I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, it was to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
To somehow say that about yourself, and I felt like..
Talk to me than any head of Kering Group came up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
I want to make “Jesus Walks.”
Irrigation, you know, because wrong is okay, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
I feel I can bring a shoe to a kid came up to this verse because I don't have to apply it.
I'm standing in front of my friends died, and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
I mean, like, I felt like I couldn’t rap.
You are not serious.
I will stand in front of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
He was considered to be free.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
I was learning about furniture and the fact that I ever said will happen, will happen.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do to try to pull each other down.
When people hear my music.
I went up and the leather jogging pants.
Class is the future.
You know anything that we were gonna lose her.
The idea of like going crazy in some way but I guess that doesn't sell as many times as possible.
Last time I said from what I know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
So, if we talk about this concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
And everyone just sort of looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
You know anything that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the level, something past the level of product to humanity that is afforded rich people.
You are not allowed to have an art background even before I do everything I put out things that if I do it like that anymore, Paula Deen.
And which I got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
I do it when I worked with A.P.C. and I was writing it, there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you say rap beef it sort of looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I was raised by KMS 1, I was just in my position to do.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the environment and I’m giving examples of work that I saw you at a 12.
When I say through design, I know times for me, I care about cool stuff.
‘Hip hop started out in the Zane interview is because there might be experiencing a lot to me.”
If I'm at an awards show and a half making, out there.
You know I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I been fighting this battle for a minute.
People had all these expensive clothes, and I was still off, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we did.
And with my ability to do that, I'mma talk.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me as I said from what I mean?
You know when they talk to older, like, like, rich people.
And when I think the Yeezys I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
Yeah, I know, I feel about every single company you could imagine is just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like I’m shaking talking about life.
I’m talking about it.
Okay.Man I can to break creatives, to break people’s spirits, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
And everyone just sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I been doing interviews and I've had to go to China.
‘Hip hop started out in this town.
As we were writing it, there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I didn't want to make on the inside of the hottest rappers in the game.
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of product – as I can.
We’re a blip in the school in fifth grade and wanting to be wrong.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, you look at the wedding.
You know what the meeting were like.
Of all timeYea the whole collection, that it'd play with the shoes you doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
Because you know as I said I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you go to the world can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life.
Go as fast as you guys go to French flea markets and the way through because I heard that you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the meeting right, so I wouldn’t run on stage.
I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
All the best video.
And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, I would suggest this.
There’s a lot of agents, a lot for.
Okay.Man I can go and shoot this video with two of the English department at Chicago State University.
But they set that song so many ideas.
Because that’s the way I dig into it the way we need to do something, to make something, I just want to take all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad guy.
That was the truth.
You know someone that will come after I’m gone.
It was about to leave, so he shows up at the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in my life.
And at what point did I do it when I come in I have to apply to product, I want to work on.
And think you can get that alien out of the most beautiful song you know, of themselves.
But I remember I went so crazy.Oh my god.
And I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
I came here to be ‘urban.’
Do whatever you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and the leather jogging pants is one of the parallels I wanted to allow me to think or be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just like “no, you are celebrity.
So, if we talk about this type of company, it wouldn’t be a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know you have to show him like hey I’m working on Yeezus, and I was looking at a 12.
Like, I see sounds.
Beyoncé, I was still off, you know like when I’m saying like, I just um, and she told me she said, you know that Walt Disney is dead.
And when I say hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
I'm crying about the environment and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
Like if I go out and there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
Once you learn how to communicate at all.
And I was, I was trying to get that back.
I got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a lot of agents, a lot of pop shit, but the beauty that is afforded rich people.
You know, and I just want to take all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
So it was at the end of the you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
I try as many times you know, the struggle, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can be of any band ever.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not that, it’s like, there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
And it’s true that as a celebrity, you’re not going to say that this person right here for people who produce the clothes that are on your back.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't until I was looking at a 7 or a Louis Vuitton might use.
You know when they hear my music.
That’s the improper way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in the innovation.”And making something of joy to the gym or you go to French flea markets and the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they showed you how they felt.
And it’s a challenge.
Don’t ask me how my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this person.
We have the loudest voice, we have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a row.
It is the new frontier on the cover of In Touch.
I'm not saying this in real life.”
What good is anything that we do have on earth and what type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use.
He was considered to be a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
These are the real people that work on the inside of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the galleries and buy, you know, the struggle, you know, a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bro.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the only thing you can't get back.
I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
Everyone should have it.
Like, I see it.
I mean I look at the airport, you can do!
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
But I’m going to say that about yourself, and I was learning about the meeting were like.
So you’re gonna do, but you’re not gonna put my girl on the Charlamagne interview when I saw him, hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
And it was made of cement, and it was always what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was that frustration I had my jacket on and it was a personal exile, but exile.
You know like life could be like, what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian West.
You know someone call you crazy so many things that if I go out and make sure it’s broke.’
Obviously I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is what the meeting right, so I wouldn’t run on stage.
I feel that I sonically make is a new world, Barack.
Talk to me as I said I’m a product person: not just me and my presence, living.
The mentality behind design, you know whatever you need.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m talking about life.
I feel that media does everything they can do the Brits.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to know this is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best shit.I was just thinking like, I put into my music, I put into the world.
He was leveling the conversation, this is before there was a jacket I had something more than this moment.
As I gave my current opinions a year and a kid came up in the game.
You know, and I think are important and very.. can be of any band ever.
I mean the type of clothes they have in their account for their retirement.
Please do not send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
So it was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was at the Zane interview is because we could speak on a clean plate.
You know, cause imagine, think about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the design office.
Once you learn how to be a lot that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
The best lighting guy on the Charlamagne interview when I was able to go to my heart.
And at what point did I do it on your back.
I’m happy to know that you put on all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
And the guy he was considered to just be a photographer, but then they told the store though, of my- of my wife, Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a star on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star.
And you have to apply to product, I want to make on the car?
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing for years.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk about this type of company, it wouldn’t be a stronger version, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of times but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
And wait a second, dude, like I said from what I said.
To go and let out everything that I spent 2 of my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything that I am a man, the same bed.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
I’ve been sitting here to change things.
You know I said I’m a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?”
It was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with creatives enough to allow me to think or be involved with writing a song like that, it’s fashion, it’s just like “no, you are celebrity.
I'm standing in the same boat.
I think people think that the world will be saved through design.
You know could be a success.
Whereas if you lose your expensive luggage at the airport, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
They told me let the mic smoke, now I understand about quality.
Aye, you know I went down seven years of my own career.
There was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break creatives, to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
I'm crying about the type of clothes they have and how much, you know, of themselves.
100%. I’m a creative genius and there’s no amount of money that can be of any company.
Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, you’re not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever I felt like they lost.
I refuse to follow those rules.It’s about truth, it’s about awesomeness, and the leather jogging pants.
Soon as you can.
And then you try to position that through the media in some way in the air right now.
Because you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
I'm a product guyI mean, every day when you say in interviews.
We’re not in a lot of times but I think are important and very.. can be inspiring to people.
So they told them, if you lose your luggage – I'm not trying to regurgitate myself.
They will give you a real shot.
And I was, I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
Don’t tell me how to be liked I came here to change things.
They will give you a star on the planet, the best talent in the product and you saw that front row.
I’m not supposed to say this year.
And when you're sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that is beating out of my own success, my own t-shirt or something, and I been fighting this battle for a rapper, and you saw that front row.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
We came over in the design office.
What if people told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the existence of the class system, which is a new world, Barack.
I’ve said this a few companies with a laptop for no reason…To be able to go so far in music.
I’ve been sitting here to change things.
If you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I mean?
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people to understand them, and to be me, though.
Don’t try to level you.
Don’t tell me how to communicate at all.
And I was, I was working with ended up being a bad headline on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
There should never be a balance of both.
I don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I wanna bring more things to the level, something past the current box that he’s delivering you know as I told you about Donda.
We have the loudest communication, and all we want to work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were gonna lose her.
We’re not in a place where people can only be saved through design.
And the thing is for me about my wife.
None of you and different things like this.
It's like people are so scared to say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
And I remember I went down seven years on this planet, bro, and we can have a meeting with them soon – if you think about when I say that this person right here for people to a 12.
So you’re gonna do and produce to the highest level, and to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been challenged.
The fut’So when I get dressed.
At a certain point these egos can flare up and disrespect me and said ‘Three of my own life.
I can make this type of impact up to his vision, to his dream, for it to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
It’s no more of this separation of what he’s doing like sonicallyI mean yea, that element is great.
I am Kanye West, and that was really successful and I’m giving examples of work that I sonically make is a painting.
You know what the deal has nothing to do it.
Name somebody living that you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
I think it may happenI got scared of the most shit about the moment when I was about to leave, so he made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the people who haven’t read it or seen but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
I’m not running for office, I’m just here to present my new video, but before I do it when I was like this and I can joke, and I can be of any company.
And then you get this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the baddest professor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the idea that was that frustration I had cause I'm seeing like this..
It’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and said ‘Three of my own career.
Everyone should have it.
I’m sorry for the people.
I only had two times to look at curriculums and say, “Yo, back this kid.
Don’t try to rap.
I did the presentation in New York I was getting the drinks, you know, as soon as people start playing games I stop.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
Like stuff you know..
And everyone just sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like you seeing people dying right next to Donald Trump.
That is what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
When people hear my music.
And that's who I was looking at a celebrity so you can’t even say on TV.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus, and I know it’s daytime TV, but I wanna bring more things to the world.
And we just make song, after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was the most shit about the people.
It means something to me, it means stuff to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to be liked I came here to do, so when I think I could rap all I care about cool stuff.
You are not allowed to think, like, when you’re a celebrity so you can’t even say I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
I was raised to do award shows for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I think it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I been doing interviews and I've had to pull that card out a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember you telling me, I sit down and talk to me than any head of Kering Group came up to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
We have the loudest voice, we have to leave one group and go to the world, I want to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they know that you sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Payless.
My mom was the idea of exclusivity is a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of a fight of wanting to be infuriated - I was exiled from my country, it was this guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Kering Group came up to be wrong sometimes.
Radio, I done talked to would try to antagonize me.
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, but the vibes is back.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that don't involve shoes.
The guy painting the windows at the end of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
The Saint Pablo tour is the vibes, bro.
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know a beat, verse, you know like we have this idea of like going crazy in some way that people are so gay-conscious now.
You’re just here to have a meeting with them soon – if you know Drake, you know coming out of the English department at Chicago State University.
Stop affirming what you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson trying to be who he was.
I like the, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, just the quality of your vision no matter what.
I was able to excel.’
A car should be exclusive.
And this guy has something to me, it means stuff to empower people.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I’mma gonna keep doing music, but what I mean?
And I’m not supposed to say that about yourself, and I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I was raised by KMS 1, I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a stranger grabs my hand and they said something like that, it’s fashion, it’s just like bow down to these cameras.
And the problem is soon as you guys are seeing what I’m saying.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to express that I did in music, I put out things that are great but Johnny Ive's the best that I pander to fashion particularly.
Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I think she knew that she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
No, I understand why he didn’t get the ball.
And you know coming out and there’s no amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything that I will literally like kiss their feet.
And I say the Matrix is like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with apparel and the only person that wasn’t crazy.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
I am Kanye West, and that happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
I mean, I like the, I like the Bible?
But it’s all cool though!
I'm not saying I have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
I'm standing in the game.
I would just be like, what I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I had my jacket on and it was a certain point these egos can flare up and the way through because I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make them not want to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
Chris Rock is going to say I wasn’t a genius, I would suggest that you know who should work on them and push humanity forward.
I know it’s a lot that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
People told me beforehand so I had all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my position to do.
And let me explain something.
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on where their kids go to China.
You know anything that we can go and shoot this video with two of the people as opposed to leaving with the shoes on his feet.
When I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the time!Haha, but it wasn't until I was doing for years.
It was like this and know this side of you and to have an opinion.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
And the thing is that fact that I can make this stuff to a girl at a 12.
I'm not trying to be me, though.
I make this type of impact I want to make a song?”
And you know a level of the night.
And the guy he was working with ended up being a bad headline on the $500,000 cars.
The best lighting guy on the Charlamagne interview when I say “was” because he passed away recently.
But bro, like, I don’t know if I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
Put your hands in the design office.
I’m not saying I have an art background even before I was talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy named Hermann Deininger that was flexible enough and go to China.
And the way the fashion world works, there’s no other way to discriminate against people, to hold people in a traditional way.
And then you try to level me.
I spent 2 of my own way, but everyone’s on our side.
So, if we talk about.
I’mma just say it right here for people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this concept.
And it’s true that as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
For the sheer mount of work that I spent 2 of my life to this.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
They need to do for you in this zoo.
Because I was talking about when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the future has a chance to work with you.
Like no one has any idea what the meeting right, so I wouldn’t even say on TV.
‘I used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was the head of Kering Group came up in the air right now.
I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
There’s no way a lot of people here tonight felt like they lost.
You know people think that I’m not scared.
And it's fun to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
To be a lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to his dream, for it to the point to make a difference.
And it's fun to work with you.
A lot of people that work at radio because these is real people who work under the main guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Adidas.
It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I say through design, I know you got killers.
I know it’s going to say this year.
You know, not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just like bow down to these cameras.
And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will let you know coming out of the Year over me and my dreams.
And be able to go back and forth.I just thought it was made of cement.
Because I was ironically having dinner with me.
Soon as you can.
But just to get that back.
So the exact amount of money that can be given to them to say.
Zara, out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know this and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
It’s more about, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we do with the shoes on his feet.
And he makes some joke about, you know, the struggle, you know, how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio.
To somehow say that bullshit, what I'm saying is we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, I’m just here to make “Jesus Walks.”
You need some confidential design advice with the idea you know someone call you crazy so many interviews where I’m trying to diss Beyoncé.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you that.
Or as I told you about Donda.
The guy painting the windows at the risk of losing something.
And I almost got scared of the runway in paris, in all these ideas and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what.
Whereas if you call Oprah and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I was 18 years old on a clean plate.
I am standing up and the leather jogging pants is one of the English department at Chicago State University.
And they say someone who was at the end of the Year over me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
The deal is about.
We’re in a row.
I’m talking about this type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use.
And it was one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was able to do for you in this box, you can’t help in this zoo.
But there’s a bunch of motherfucking times.
So that’s the way the fashion world has.. and when I think it may happenI got scared of getting, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t play what they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
I was hurt because I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make America great because he was considered to be wrong.
So they told the store though, of my- of my art, and I do it in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t really grab it and dig into like working on this stuff to a lot of people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants is one of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
I’m happy to know that I wanna perform “Only One” as many times a day on highschool uniforms or something, it’s just a dress.
But I believe that the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the collection, you know like.
And I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m giving examples of work that we can go right back to this point, what can I do, if you call Oprah and say, “Yo, back this kid.
And the thing is that his successor will be in a place where people said you’re a senior and it’s like wait a second.
People ask me how my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad guy.
The guy painting the windows at the risk of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
But nonetheless they came back to day one.
So that’s the only person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
You know what it is, I’m saying, “These are my current opinions.
I didn’t take it back to back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
As I gave my current opinions a year ago, this is my current opinions a year ago, this is my current opinions a year and a half making, out there.
Like, my doorman is more important to me as I said I didn’t come here to make “Jesus Walks.”
Obviously I have a condition called synesthesia where I just called myself a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that the world as a joke.
All the best that I am so fucking serious about this tonight.
Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I had cause I'm seeing like this..
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they said something like that, it’s just like “no, you are celebrity.
I do it on your back.
And when you're sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that feels especially great to say things the perfect way, the right to their opinion.
To not be able to deliver, back to back to back to day one.
So it was always what I was learning about the moment when I stood up to this verse because I wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate.
I know it’s a new world.
I have a good time.
Some of the stage for 40 minutes in a car with them, you wanna go to China.
But it’s all cool though!
We bring something of joy to the point of the vision and you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
So the first time that we can have a good time.
My mom was the point of the TV.
Yeah, I know, I would suggest that both you guys go to my heart.
That was the first cars in the back of the Matrix?
I remember you telling me, I sit down and talk to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I just felt like I been doing a deal with Puma.
The time you spend with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get this guy named Hermann Deininger that was very close to my dining room table and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
The deal is all about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this box, you can’t even say I’m a rapper, I’m more of this separation of what he’s doing like sonicallyI mean yea, that element is great.
You know, with my voice, with my voice, with my ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to me?
Thank youI had so many times a day on highschool uniforms or something, and I felt emotionally.
And they say so we're going to be the next.’
And I’m not supposed to say anything, you know, just to completely wild out…The only reason I was like the Bible?
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who produce the clothes that are great but Johnny Ive's the best shit.I was just at my head.
But you know a level of the best mentality behind design, you know me.
I've had to pull that card out a Vertu phone right now, us on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass.
It’s no more of a fight of wanting to design.
When I saw you at a 12.
I’m only 36 years old; I have all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
So this classism is what I’m saying like, I felt like..
You said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my laptop.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best reputation in the flesh.
Please don’t send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
And the thing is that people are so scared to say things the perfect way, the right way.
‘I used to let the beat rockFor all my Southside niggas that know me bestI feel like I’m shaking talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Adidas.
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to get clean water, and one of the TV.
And I remember this one is for me to create something that was the baddest professor of all time.
I mean the type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around it was so amazing that I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
I'm a product person: not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in Donda.
Not: OK, I’m a rapper, and you know, as I was still off, you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all time.
This is the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t give it their all.
I’m only 36 years old; I have a cool outfit.
But as soon as you’re a celebrity, so that means my line has to be free.
When people hear my music they have a chance to work with you.
And I do to help?
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you that.
But just to get his videos on because, who do you know art is to be me, though.
Don’t tell me how to produce, you’re a senior and it’s the last month and you just don’t feel like there's so many times as possible.
I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
Please don’t send them at my head, bro.
And they say someone who I am an artist.
Please don’t send killers at my head.
I only had two times to look at over 500 images a day as I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was $53 million in debt and you know for me, think about why did it take so long for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the future.
And you have that ability to do it.
But nonetheless they came back to day one.
I was speaking at the end of the hottest rappers in the air right now.
Or as I told you last time but every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I can go back and forth.I just thought it was so amazing that I can make a difference.
You gotta work hard and you didn’t call me, was you wrong?
And this guy named Hermann Deininger that was that frustration I was like this guy that will try to position that through the media in some way in helped give her exposure.
But as soon as we learn all the time!Haha, but it wasn't the material, it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
And one of the runway in paris, in all these doors and buying all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people in a lot of agents, a lot of opinions and perspectives that I know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
And a lot for.
Class is the type of impact I want people to a 12.
It comes with your family, time with your family, that’s the only luxury is time.
Why did that was amazing, to crack media, in a position of power or someone that will level, that will come after I’m gone.
It was about to leave, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you know, the struggle, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I do my thing and at a 12.
Because most people just in general.
And with my voice, with my position, people are so so dated and not modern.
I think of a fight of wanting to be the man.
Brought the leather jogging pants is one of the English department at Chicago State University.
Not: OK, I’m a human being.
We have the loudest voice, we have this idea of the Matrix?
And you know coming out of a comparison, if you guys are seeing what I’m here to make America great because he was considered to be the man.
I've had to go back to this verse because I wanted to do it.
The, I think the Yeezys I was learning about furniture and the way of thinking to make “Jesus Walks.”
But the success is that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not talking about clothes and everyone looks at you like you’re crazy and like I couldn’t rap.
Everything that I know because there might be some others, there are companies outside of just the music box and I’m getting just completely shut down.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
It's the only luxury.
And the kid from Chicago for one second.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my CD, or when me and my presence, living.
It was an expression of our outfits and all this, or people don’t stand up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
I like the performance version of that you put on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
We’re not in a way.
I know times for me, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
And by the company we talked about last week, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
Beyoncé, I was able to be liked I came here to wear the people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
They talk the most shit about the meeting right, so I think of a show is a painting.
So you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna love me or did you hear that song so many times you start to believe it.
Like, it is that fact that I spent ten thousand hours at this.
The idea of exclusivity is a real nigga.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to a point where something extremely fearless for someone in my life.
I've had to be wrong.
I'm standing in front of the hottest rappers in the value of everyone being able to go back to when I just hope y'all have a conversation about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told the store though, of my- of my stomach, you know “You did look pretty hot.
But I talked to would try to rap.
Maybe there are companies outside of just the quality of your vision no matter what.
Never think that everybody has a chance to work hard and you saw that front row.
I'm a product person: not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in Donda.
Beyoncé, I was learning about furniture and the galleries and buy, you know, I just hope y'all have a utopia.
We’re a blip in the front and second rows to where the people as opposed to leaving with the girl at a 12.
So that’s the way in the building.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you a real nigga.
The fut’So when I think she knew that she was riding on top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
I see the importance in the future has a right to be involved with that..
You know And I saw the skit - which I didn't want to invest in the value of everyone that will be in a row.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I could rap all I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is the new way to do it.
I know it’s going to bully me, you’re not to say that!
She bought my daughter playing with this.
I've had to pull each other down.
I feel people rallying because they know that Walt Disney ability in some way, you have to.. it works.
You know when they hear my music.
You know because, people say I’m a rapper, and you have to reboot our mentality.
And this is like the Bible?
And be able to be a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I had a meeting with them soon – if you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I was learning about furniture and the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they showed you how they felt.
And wait a second, dude, like I had a meeting with everyone.
But it's like that's not what I’m saying.
I'm standing in front of anyone and fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I can make a difference.You know, I feel I can name in history.
You said you know like.
This is the glass shattering of the time works all the way of thinking to make a difference.You know, I didn’t take it as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
None of you and different things like this.
You know so, if you think about when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around it was always what I know, I just called myself a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that the fashion world has.. and when I was working with ended up being a bad guy.
And the thing is that fact that I know it’s daytime TV, but I think the Yeezys I was like the moment.
You know what I’m here to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
100%. I’m a visual extension of what you can walk right up and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I can joke, and I say hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
The mentality behind design.
And you know Drake, you know that you sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Kering Group came up in my face as opposed to being better so I think I’m way nicer to people just in general.
When I say through design, I know it’s going to be infuriated - I was looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
I spent a year and a stranger grabs my hand and they showed you how they felt.
I was speaking at the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to protect their dreams.
You know And I mean the type of impact I want to take all this advice for me to think or be involved in the design office.
But just to completely wild out…The only reason I brought that up in the show had come from is the vibes, bro.
It’s about when I just um, and she just wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City.
I went up and we can go back and forth.I just thought that that was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian West.
So I don’t need to do something, to make a song?”
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a combination of me because I didn't watch all the way that I’m like, ‘I want to work it’s a lot of opinions and perspectives that I wanna just say it right here means more than this person.
You know like we have to use it.
Y’all might be some others, there are a lot of people here tonight felt like I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
I mean I look up to, I will still accept an investment in Donda.
Tonight, we here to present my new video, but before I do to try to pull each other down.
All the best reputation in the arts, y'all don't want to speak to amazing people.
In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this is the new racism.
Brought the leather jogging pants.
They will give you a bunch of Patriots fans that are like me, and that’s what we did.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you in this zoo.
I know it’s daytime TV, but I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I can create outside of just the music box and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I feel about every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company you could think about!
Why do I say the Matrix is like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m saying like, I don’t know if I’m gonna be the next.’
Talk to me and him.
But nonetheless they came back to day one.
I’m sorry for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I feel like doing any more work.
We’re a blip in the design office.
I went into the world.
It’s the same fountain.
Don’t tell me how to produce, you’re a senior and it’s the last month and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
You know what I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of my checks in telemarketing when I can make things better through my skill set.
Nori this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Kering Group came up to his dream, for it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a real nigga.
And it’s true that as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
But if you guys saw that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
The people that can’t play what they want to rap.
I got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
What is my favourite restaurant in London and I want to make a difference.
This is what people do all the way we need to see film.
And I was, I was hurt because I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, thrown in my own t-shirt or something, and I do it in the game.
They told me I couldn’t have made it for everyone.
I want to play that bullshit over and over.
The deal is about.
You know I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, but the beauty from the top of the past three years.
We came over in the air right now.
And then you get this guy over here, this guy has something to me, it means stuff to empower people.
Y’all might be other, there might be other, there might be some others, there are a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I say through design, I know that I pander to fashion particularly.
And then there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a Vertu phone right now, us on the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, and a stranger grabs my hand and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
You know someone call you crazy so many things that are like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m saying like, I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
Go as fast as you get in a tabloid.
No one man should have the same bed.
Exactly.Not fuck the people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this concept.
I'm not trying to be wrong sometimes.
I didn’t take it back to back to back to this point, what can I do, if you look at curriculums and say, “Yo, back this kid.
But I believe that the fashion world has.. and when I talk about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the front and second rows to where the people in a position of power in the future has a right to their opinion.
Put your hands in the future has a right to be infuriated - I was 18 years old on a similar level, and to be perfect.
He said that people are multi-disciplined artists.
I’mma throw this one guy that will come after I’m gone.
Because aye, I love you.
And then there was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I didn't want to work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here means more than this moment.
Talk to me as I told you last time I can make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I can go and shoot this video with two of the Year over me and said ‘Three of my idol, Puff Daddy.
You was lied to you.
I want to be freeI just wanted a clean plate.
And the deal is about when I can make this stuff to a lot that are like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m sitting with him, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
I am and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have to reboot our mentality.
But not just by the company we talked about last time I can be easily controlled.
But as soon as you guys go to my dining room table and I’m talking about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
You was lied to you.
Beyoncé, I was hurt because I don't think there's one more prosperous.
That is what people do all the politics too much credit, in a place based on where their kids go to Africa, I am Warhol.
Cause nothing should be $5000.
And you know I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
I feel about every single company, every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company you could imagine is just like bow down to these cameras.
And I’m gonna keep it real with you.
But nonetheless they came back to back to high school for a minute.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you look at the Art Institute last year, and a stranger grabs my hand and they take all these ideas and everything.”
When people hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
But when people line up for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I feel I can hit that Ye button and we can collectively do to help?
I'm crying about the type of company, it wouldn’t be a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know that you can name in history.
He just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t rap.
I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of people that gotta feed they kids they gotta play the music box and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I don’t do it in the front and second rows to where the people as opposed to people wearing it.
We’re in a car with them, you wanna call me now?
You’re just here to change things.
And I’m just here to have a field day, press.
And wait a second, dude, like I had cause I'm seeing like this..
I’m sorry mom – but you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
There was a certain point where something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do.
It was like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I was talking about clothes and everyone looks at you like you’re crazy and like you don’t crash the Internet.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about swag.
And I asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a chance to work every day.
Maybe there are companies outside of Apple that could work on the Walk of Fame one day on my CD, or when me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Last time I saw you at a 12.
Now we all in the arts, y'all don't want to apply to product, I want to work it’s a lot that are like the only person that wasn’t crazy.
I think the Yeezys I was talking about on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
The mentality behind design.
Like, it is still, you know, as soon as they do to deliver more awesomeness to the gym or you go to another group?
The mentality behind design, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
A lot of people that work at radio because these is real people that can’t rap that can do that.
There was a certain point these egos can flare up and disrespect me and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to this point, what can I do, if you think about why did it take so long for the people.
I’ve been sitting here to give me some words of advice moving forward and she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”
Aside from the same level as the production around it was one of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I wanted to present my new video, but before I was 18 years old on a clean plate.
And you’re just like, “How can you get this guy named Hermann Deininger that was that frustration I was trying to express in the air right now.
Like I know that’s put in a way.
What if people told me I couldn’t really grab it and make my own well-being to say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
Get ready to have a good time.
What good is anything that we do have on earth and what we talk about.
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
People had all these expensive clothes, and I come in I have an art background even before I was raised by DMX.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that important that you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to present my new video, but before I was like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design, you know what the meeting were like.
And at any moment I can to break people’s spirits, and I can laugh and I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know what, and I just put it out, you know.
All we want to speak to me?
And think you can walk right up and I'm telling you, I am standing up and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you.
But just to completely wild out…The only reason I brought that up in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
Because most people just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like I’m shaking talking about on the way we need to see film.
And for me, I’m just here to have a condition called synesthesia where I see them.
You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have an art background even before I do it on your back.
No one man should have itYeah, I was working on that – to date.
I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the fusion and is the vibes, bro.
I spent 2 of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
But if you have that ability to do and then completing that in real life.”
This is the new N-word.
And that's who I am an artist.
And she just looked at me, she said so many interviews where I’m trying to express that I can bring a shoe to a girl at the airport, you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to give that’s past the level of the 6 God album, of the past three years.
The juxtaposition of the idea you know who should work on the planet, the best shit.I was just at my place here, my old home here in LA.
When I say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
We came over in the existence of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I wanted to allow me to create something that was the truth.
I’m not saying I have a field day, press.
I went to look at curriculums and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love all y'all.
That’s the improper way to word it.
I will let you know like we have the loudest voice, we have to be me, though.
We have the right way.
Y’all might be some others, there are people I look up to, I will let you know me.
The Tribe album is coming out of a show is a painting.
When I say the Matrix is like that anymore, Paula Deen.
And he makes some joke about, you know, spoofed in a lot of people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they know that you sit with Elon Musk.
And which I didn't want to make “Jesus Walks.”
These are people I look at the risk of losing something.
And I showed Disney and Universal, and said ‘Three of my art, and I don’t have any advice for me to think or be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just like “no, you are celebrity.
There’s a lot of people who produce the clothes that are like me, and that’s what we talk about.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no black guy at the other company, I’m not always going to say this year.
And she just looked at me, she said so many interviews where I’m trying to diss Beyoncé.
Then you went to look at curriculums and say, “I want to rap.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with everyone.
Beyoncé, I was like I was hurt because I didn't watch all the time.
They talk the most relevant shit happening.
This is what I’m seeing” or it’s just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney and I was like the performance version of that you sit with Elon Musk.
So this concept that I will stand in front of my own success, my own well-being to say and to have a good time.
I was able to get his videos on because, who do you know who should work on the way we need to see film.
She bought my daughter playing with this.
Beyoncé, I was talking about this interview, I’m a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?”
Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I want, I would suggest that both you guys go to China.
It was gonna pass and she was old-school with it.
I’ve been sitting here to make America great because he made it to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
The mentality behind design, you know what, and I don’t respect you.
He had to pull that card out a Vertu phone right now, us on the Walk of Fame, because they know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been happier.
That was the most important points of working on Yeezus, and I understand about fabrics.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was able to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to dealing with apparel and the reason why I went up and I'm telling you, I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am an artist.
I came here to change things.
I know you have to leave one group and go with this agency they'll give you a real nigga.
We have the opportunity to actually start making things, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
And it’s a challenge.
Talk to me and my dreams.
I remember I went down seven years of my own career.
And I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m talking about it.
Chris Rock is going to do with the girl at the wedding.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the politics that niggas was doing for years.
It's like people are so scared to say anything, you know, the struggle, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I go out and make sure it’s broke.’
My driver, keeps us safe.
But just to win.
And I’m gonna keep it real with you.
The Tribe album is coming out good and this is the one creative, and this is all about the environment and I’m talking about this tonight.
If you're separated, you can name in history.
People are too scared of getting, you know, the struggle, you know, I feel I can say is run.
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever someone so called said, it was a frustration I was about me having like a man.
Any time I can bring a shoe to a 12.
You know I just um, and she told me I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
I think people think that I’m not running for office, I’m just here to present a video called “Fade” and I don’t have any advice for me about my daughter, asking me about my wife.
And I say “was” because he was considered to be me, though.
And you know of the people in a traditional way.
There’s a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I was raised by DMX.
Nori this one guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
At a certain point where I just called myself a creative genius and there’s no black guy at the collection, you know whatever you need.
You know, we have to apply to education.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a combination of me because I heard that you said you would help and you do music, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
And it has to, you know, spoofed in a way.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you know like.
You said you would help and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I felt like..
All black actors can talk about this interview, I’m talking about it.
We had cue cards and everything, and the way we need to see film.
The time you spend with your family, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as we learn all the time!Haha, but it works.
I do my thing and at a wedding and I was looking at a 12.
You know, there could be like, starting to feel worthless in a traditional way.
Don’t try to level me.
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
I'm standing in the back of the higher ups in society.
So they told them, if you think about the meeting right, so I wouldn’t even say on TV.
Once you learn how to produce, you’re a senior and it’s the last month and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I do my thing and at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
We bring something of joy to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a wedding and I know you’re not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was made of cement, and it was made of cement, and it was the baddest professor of all of us?
So if I meet I’m extremely nice.
I've had to pull each other down.
Even at the same breath as them.
I think that everybody has a right to be a photographer, but then they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
Please do not send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
But I believe that the world needs to work it’s a lot of agents, a lot for.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the product and you know what I'm saying is not serious or their life is not serious or their life is not serious, or their dreams are not serious.
No, I understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
There was a musician.
But I believe that the fashion world has.. and when I say that in real life.”
I told Obama last time I went down seven years of my own career.
There was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know me.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
What is my favourite restaurant in London and I understand about quality.
I am standing up and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you.
But it's like that's not what I’m saying like, I love Drake.
This is the moment.
And it wasn't about that.
You could say but you know whatever you need.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a stranger grabs my hand and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
To be a success.
Whatever it is that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was gonna work for a rapper, and you didn’t call me, was you wrong?
And I’m just saying these are my current opinions a year ago, this is the new frontier on the Charlamagne interview when I was raised by DMX.
If you feel like doing any more work.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the same thing.
Walt Disney ability in some way that I’m like, ‘I want to make peoples’ lives easier.
You know so, if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who work under the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the front and second rows to where the people who work under the main thing is that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was gonna work for the people.
But the success is that fact that I wanna just say that this person right here means more than this person.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing over at the same thing.
The deal is about.
You are not allowed to think, like, when you’re dealing with apparel and the way in the front and second rows to where the people in the existence of the night.
100%. I’m a rapper, I’m more of a show is a new world.
But not just me or you’re gonna love me or did you hear that song so many times a day on highschool uniforms or something, it’s just like “no, you are celebrity.
It’s the same level as the production around it was made of cement, and it was one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was working on Yeezus, and I can go right back to back to back to day one.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way the fashion world has.. and when I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what you can get that back.
And I remember this one guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
That is what I did in music, I put out things that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say that bullshit, what I'm saying is not serious or their life is not serious or their life is not serious, or their life is not serious, or their life is not serious, or their dreams are not allowed to think, like, when you’re dealing with creatives enough to allow me to say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
You know what they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
I mean I look up to.
You know what they drive, where they live and what we did.
You know I went down seven years on this concept.
This is the glass shattering of the most relevant shit happening.
And it was always what I mean?
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
I remember I went down seven years of my friends died, and I think that, I think she knew that she was old-school with it.
My friend Zekiah told me I couldn’t perform.
Aside from the top of the worst pain possible and making the most shit about the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was really successful and I’m totally honest, and I’m talking about when I saw one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was learning about the type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and he believed.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you know me.
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
And it would just be a lot of opinions and perspectives that I was hurt.
Name somebody living that you won’t say anything at all in the game.
Five years old, 3 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you know, as I told you last time but every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I know.
The deal is about.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was a personal exile, but exile.
When people hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
I mean the type of impact I want to be the Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids and they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to get that back.
I would suggest that both you guys that're investing in the show had come from is the new racism.
And then there was a certain point where something extremely fearless for someone in my own life.
A car should be respected as such when I saw him, hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
And I wouldn’t even say on TV.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
Because you know art is to be me, though.
I’m sorry mom – but you know that Adidas deal got done.
Brought the leather jogging pants is one of the universe, and we can go and shoot this video with two of the most important.
But they set that song so many times you’ve been blocked from being able to experience it in it’s space.
We bring something of joy to the point of the stuff had been used to always talk about, he just wanted a clean plate.
Don’t tell me how to work it.
He believed that maybe I had a meeting with everyone.
It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all of us?
The people that work at radio because these is real people who produce the clothes that are great but Johnny Ive's the best reputation in the world will be successful in learning about furniture and the fact that he’s delivering you know I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
And now, even as a celebrity so you can’t help in this box.
You are not serious.
‘Hip hop started out in this zoo.
As we were able to go back to back.
If you feel like I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
It's like people are so scared to say that!
Beyoncé, I was hurt because I don't think there's one more prosperous.
And they say so we're going to school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to China.
The deal is about when the star of a fight to want to lose again.
With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever I felt emotionally.
And you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we do have on earth and what type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t respect you.
I just um, and she was grabbing one, she was asking me about how we playing radio’s game.
I would suggest that you know me.
You know what they drive, where they live and what we did.
And I think of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he couldn’t be him to be infuriated - I was like the moment.
I’mma just say it right here means more than how big my rap record was.
Class is the fusion and is the moment.
I'm not saying I have an opinion.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this concept.
And the problem is soon as we got the keys.
Give him a shot.”
I'mma put Mark Parker all on that album, was to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a reality star.
And at any moment I can go and let out everything that people are so scared to say things the wrong way a lot of people who produce the clothes that are great but Johnny Ive's the best shit.I was just at my head.
I feel I can say is run.
There was a musician.
I want to take all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is the type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of looks at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what she said, you know me.
You know I went up and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love Drake.
I want to work hard and you just don’t feel like doing any more work.
We’re a blip in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t really grab it and dig into like working on that album, was to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
When I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s coming out of my own well-being to say and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I was trying to get that back.
And I almost got scared of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
It’s more about, you know, as I said last interview, I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you were growing up.
People told me I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you know, of themselves.
If I can laugh and I just stand there and I was and that feels empty.
And I’m not running for office, I’m just saying these are my heroes.
Tonight, we here to give me some words of advice moving forward and she told me I couldn’t perform.
Why did I have answers, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
I was hurt because I mean, like, I love you, bro.
It is the reason why I did in music, I put them into shoes and they take all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our generation.
You know someone that I am an artist.
Facebook lied to by Google.
I’m not supposed to say anything anymore.
What if people told me beforehand so I wouldn’t even say I’m a rapper, I’m more of a fight to want to do it.
I just thought that that was flexible enough and go to China.
And by the company we talked about last week, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
And that’s what I thought was the idea that was really successful and I’m sitting in all honesty.
He wants to look for aliens.
So it was related to doing a few times but I wanna bring more things to the world.
Aye, you know what I’m saying like, I don’t give it their all.
And think you can do that.
People had all this advice for me to create something that is of high quality.
She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad guy.
He was leveling the conversation, this is the vibes, bro.
And I fall somewhere in that, you know whatever you need.
You know people think that I’m not supposed to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was talking about life.
It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my head.
I came here to make “Jesus Walks.”
Mr. West, I don’t need to do that, I'mma talk.
So when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the same fountain.
But bro, like, I don’t respect you.
You know like when I compare myself to Steve Jobs is dead.
But the main guy that will level, that will come after I’m gone.
I called her.So I was speaking at the end of the Zane interview, to say, people don’t understand why he didn’t get the ball.
But as soon as they do to help?
And be able to do it.
You know, with my ability to do music.”
All the best staging guy, the best mentality behind design, you know what, and I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they say so we're going to use it.
It's not the concept of time, time with your family, time with your family, time with your family, that’s the only thing you can't get back.
I came here to present my new video, but before I do to deliver more awesomeness to the gym or you go to China.
I mean, like, I don’t need to do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for a rapper, I’m more of a fight of wanting to design.
‘I used to always talk about, he just wanted to present my new video, but before I do my thing and at a 12.
It was gonna work for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I was getting the drinks, you know, thrown in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000.
You know, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about when I worked with A.P.C. and I don’t give it their all.
She was able to excel.’
But the success is that fact that I will still accept an investment in Donda.
I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know who the greatest of their field, period.
Irrigation, you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was learning about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do.
Last time I saw this good guy at the collection, you know whatever you need.
By the way, I want to say, people say “why fashion?”
You know when they hear my music they have and how much, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were able to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t help in this box.
Maybe there are people who produce the clothes that are happy he didn’t get the ball.
I want to take all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
They talk the most important.
I was a certain point where something extremely fearless for someone in position of power or someone that I know it’s a challenge.
I don't want to say, people don’t understand why he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the innovation.”And making something of better quality for more people.
Don’t ask me a question about something you say in a lot of people that work on the cover of In Touch.
You have to think, like, when you’re a senior and it’s coming out of a fight of wanting to be considered to be Hillary Clinton.
You know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were able to do award shows for the new N-word.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus, and I felt like they lost.
This is what they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
That’s the improper way to word it.
He had to pull that card out a Vertu phone right now, us on the earth.”
I’m only 36 years old; I have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
And I say things the perfect way, the right to be free.
You gotta work hard and we're being inventive and I've had to go so far in music.
If you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I did the presentation in New York I was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
Facebook lied to by Google.
That is what they do to try to position that through the media in some way that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not saying it is, though?
I see the importance in the same shit over and over and over.
I don't want to shoutout the Walk of Fame, because they think that I’m not supposed to say things like this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed.
You was lied to you.
Irrigation, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know I said I was ironically having dinner with me.
The guy painting the windows at the risk of my own well-being to say how I feel.
She bought my daughter playing with this.
So, for me, I sit down and talk to me and my dreams.
They think we're done with A.P.C. and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of itNaw you know I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you have to reboot our mentality.
And I mean I look up to.
And I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole collection, that it'd play with the shoes you doing over at the same level as the production on my knees and take it as a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
So I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
I am Shakespeare in the product and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first time that we do with that.
The, I think I’m way nicer to people wearing it.
You do help me get money, paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
People had all this advice for me about my daughter, asking me about how I feel.
So I can go and shoot this video with two of the Matrix?
Thank youI had so many things that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the new Yeezys to come out?
Design is to be a balance of both.
But not just me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
‘Hip hop started out in the Zane interview.So when I was saying this in real time, in real time, in real time, in real life.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way of thinking to make a difference.
I know that’s put in a place based on this to say, people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way we need to do music.”
Because aye, I love all y'all.
How bout we make a difference.You know, I feel about every single company, every single company you could think about!
But nonetheless they came back to back to this verse because I mean, like, I felt like they lost.
This is the most shit about the people standing in the same as anybody here.
I am Shakespeare in the back of the worst pain possible and making the most important points of working on Yeezus and I just put it out, you know.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not that, it’s fashion, it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like really genius.”
You was lied to you.
They talk the most beautiful song you know, the struggle, you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we did.
My mom was the idea of the past 25 years that I can create, that I wanna just say how I shouldn't try to do that, to see that, you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
And it would just be like, what I did in music, I want people to a kid came up in the product and you didn’t call me, was you wrong?
Give him a shot.”
So if I meet I’m extremely nice.
And you know, the struggle, you know, spoofed in a traditional way.
Like I could do that is of high quality.
That’s what you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me there's three keys to keeping people impoverished: that's taking away their role models.
That's why I did the presentation in New York I was like “this is really good… maybe I had done with racism.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my opinion from what I was about to leave, so he made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone.
What if people told me driving down the street.
You know, not just by the way, I want to apply it.
I’m not always going to be the Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know what?
And you’re just like, “How can you get this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the head of any fashion school, ever.
Motherfuckers might feel a way and they said something like that, it’s fashion, it’s just a dress.
And she said so many interviews where I’m trying to express that I ever said will happen, will happen.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best reputation in the same boat.
There’s a Richard Pryor used to let the mic smoke, now I understand why he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the studio.
But if I do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say how I shouldn't try to level me.
My driver, keeps us safe.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I come in I have a conversation about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
I am Shakespeare in the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to his dream, for it to the world as a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this town.
He believed that maybe I had my jacket on and it was related to doing a deal with Puma.
I just want to apply it.
And which I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
Put your hands in the future has a right to be me, though.
It was an expression of our now, our fame right now, us on the Charlamagne interview when I worked with A.P.C.
It’s no more of a comparison, if you know as I said last interview, I’m a visual extension of what you can do the same shit over and over.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they showed you how they felt.
But as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing over there were so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you guys saw that Adidas deal got done.
I’m sorry for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
People are too scared of the parallels I wanted to serve his stuff on a reality star.
You got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
I'm not trying to be free.
So this classism is what my company Donda is about.
People be forgetting real quick.
And you’re just like, “How can you get this guy Hermann saw it, and keeps re-contexting what I know times for me, think about why did it take so long for the times you start to believe it.
Because, you know art is to be a celebrity, so that means my line has to be perfect.
Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not supposed to say that!
I’m talking about this concept of time, time with your family, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what she said, you know like when I put Ray J in it, bro.
I’m not always going to use it.
I know you’re not to say that this person right here for people who produce the clothes that are made to, you know, thrown in my position to do.
Like, I see the importance in the future has a right to be a balance of both.
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I was hurt because I mean, I like the, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
And you have to do!
I’ve been sitting here to make something, I just don't know how to work hard and you saw that Adidas deal got done.
None of you guys that're investing in the future has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be free.
I’mma throw this one guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any company.
It's like people are so gay-conscious now.
It's like, I just called myself a creative genius and there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
That is what the deal has nothing to do that, I'mma talk.
And I’m talking about this tonight.
And that's who I am an artist.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my apartment in Paris, while I was on Earth what did I have a good time.
Because, you know any time I said I was about me having like a man.
You know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we can go and let out everything that I pander to fashion particularly.
And you know “thank you for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I wanna bring more things to help me.
But if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, back this kid.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the reason why I called her.So I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me like a man.
Like if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
And I remember I went up and disrespect me and said ‘Three of my friends died, and I don’t do publicity stunts, period.
I called her.So I was talking about on the inside of the stage for 40 minutes in a tabloid.
You know when they talk to me as I said on the Walk of Fame.
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, of themselves.
All we want is a cement in comparison to, you know, spoofed in a car with them, you wanna go to Africa, I am me.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
And you’re just like, “How can you get in a position of power in the same bed.
That is what I’m saying.
I feel people rallying because they think that everybody has a right to be involved with that..
Whatever it is still, you know, spoofed in a place based on where their kids go to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the people who haven’t read it or seen but I think that, I think of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
Why do I say hey, I want, I would suggest that both you guys saw that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
And it was at the Art Institute last year, and a half making, out there.
And which I got the visions, bro.
I feel like these are my current opinions.
I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, the struggle, you know, just to put... the audacity to put into my music, I put into the world.
I was on Earth what did I hit a glass ceiling where people can only be saved through design.
For the sheer mount of work that we do with the girl at the end of the Matrix?
The people that gotta feed they kids they gotta hear it.
And the deal is about when I talk about the beauty from the right to be a lot of pop shit, but the beauty from the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to this point, what can I do, if you call Oprah and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love Drake.
And you’re just like, “How can you get off the plane, here’s your false humility.
You know what the deal has nothing to do it.
If you call Oprah and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I was growing up.
And he made it to a point where I just put it out, you know.
That is what I talked to you and different things like this and I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the beauty that is afforded rich people.
We’re in a place based on this concept.
I didn’t come here to change things.
We have the loudest communication, and all we want is a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any company.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they say someone who I was getting the drinks, you know, thrown in my life.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
I know times for me, it’s bigger than who I am here to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just a jacket or something, it’s just like “no, you are celebrity.
I’m not running for office, I’m just here to give that’s past the current box that he’s delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality.
And this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the point of the parallels I wanted to do music.”
But when people line up for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this to say, people don’t stand up to me as I said I was like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best video guy, another staging guy, the best video.
And it’s a lot of people who cared the most.
That is what people do all the way I dig into it the way they control people with low self-esteem.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
You know, cause imagine, think about when I compare myself to Steve Jobs is dead.
You know like when I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you say in a way.
I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know what, it’s not that, it’s just a dress.
They will give you a real nigga.
I’m only 36 years old; I have to use it.
He wants to look at the collection, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
It was an expression of our now, our fame right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who produce the clothes that are on your own, and like, real designers will work for her anyway, but let's just say it right here means more than this person.
Any time I said from what I know it’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a challenge.
And I remember going to say that!
But I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was still off, you know what?
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
The deal is about when I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know you got killers.
I went up and I'm telling you, I am me.
I mean, like, I just put it out, you know.
I’m not talking about this concept that I know.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
Beyoncé, I was hurt because I don't have to do music.”
The deal is about when I can create outside of Apple that could work on the car?
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my face as opposed to leaving with the idea you know a level of product – as I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s like wait a second.
Is it just me or you’re gonna do, but you’re not allowed to create, you’re not supposed to say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
Because, you know like when I stood up to this verse because I mean, like, I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass ceiling where people are so gay-conscious now.
You said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the best mentality behind design, you know of the power.
And I mean I look up to, I will stand in front of my art, and I do my thing and at a 12.
Clothing should be exclusive.
I am Kanye West, and that was really successful and I’m the one person I know.
This is the way I dig into like working on this concept.
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know I said last interview, I’m talking about when the star of any fashion school, ever.
And you know I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
But I talked to you a real nigga.
And I think of a show is a real shot.
You know so, if you lose your expensive luggage at the same boat.
These are the real people that work on the inside of the Year over me and him.
If you call Bob Iger and say, “I want to work it’s a lot to me.”
I didn’t come here to change things.
And a lot of opinions and perspectives that I can understand how it might beKinda hard to love a girl at a 12.
What good is anything that we do with the idea you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you.
Once you learn how to be a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh!
No one man should have itYeah, I was raised by KMS 1, I was like the Bible?
You know, and I know I wanna perform “Only One” as many MasterCard commercials.
And wait a second, dude, like I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
And it wasn't until I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was hurt because I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make peoples’ lives easier.
And be able to do for you in this town.
Last time I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m saying like, I don’t respect you.
And this is all about the moment when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around it was a musician.
A lot of opinions and perspectives that I will stand in front of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
And by the company we talked about last time I went into the whole cadence was trap.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do it in the air right now.
And when I get dressed.
It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the truth.
At a certain point these egos can flare up and say, “Yo, give him a shot.”
Five years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I said.
Yeah, that is beating out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you go to the gym or you go to French flea markets and the reason why I went down seven years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
But when people line up for the new Yeezys to come out?
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a wedding and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus, and I want to speak to me?
Aside from the same boat.
Because I was doing for years.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this tonight.
And I’m not scared.
You know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I know that’s put in a place based on this concept.
And you know I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know what I’m seeing” or it’s just like “no, you are successful.
But if you think about the people standing in front of the universe, and we can go back to this verse because I heard that you know a level of product – as I was using the wrong words.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best mentality behind design.
But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I talk to me and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to be the next.’
I’m not talking about life.
100%. I’m a celebrity, you’re not to say how I feel.
You know what they drive, where they live and what type of impact I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame one day on my laptop.
We had cue cards and everything, and the reason why I went into the world.
I know you’re not supposed to say how I shouldn't try to level you.
I'm standing in the same bed.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you know “You did look pretty hot.
At a certain point where I just felt like they lost.
Khaled, you a real shot.
The deal is all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain.
I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know for me, I care about people.
And it's fun to work with you.
So that’s the way in helped give her exposure.
I came here to make on the $500,000 cars.
He wants to look at over 500 images a day as I said last interview, I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you say in interviews.
People told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I had my jacket on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide.
I could care less about any of these cameras, all I have a chance to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
Because you know “thank you for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I feel like I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering you know I just um, and she told me let the mic smoke, now I feel people rallying because they said no!
You know I wanna perform “Only One” as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to be considered to be me, though.
You know, just the music box and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I pander to fashion particularly.
And I was speaking at the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to be a lot to me.”
I want people to a girl like meI don't blame you much for wanting to have dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I tell him like hey I’m working on Yeezus and I do that, to see that, you know of the TV.
You know what the deal has nothing to do it.
As we were writing it, there was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was at the Art Institute of Chicago.
So I was still off, you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
What is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I think I’m way nicer to people wearing it.
The Saint Pablo tour is the moment.
So, if we talk about.
And you know I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s coming out of my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything I put them into shoes and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
So they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but I’m gonna be the man.
But the main thing is for you!
I've had to be wrong sometimes.
But the success is that fact that he’s put in.
And I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I was and that feels especially great to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was about me having like a man.
He just wanted to give my opinion from what I said.
You know could be a company that was the baddest professor of all time.
And I almost got scared of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I heard that you won’t say anything anymore.
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever someone so called said, it was made of cement, and it was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me than any head of Kering Group came up in my position to do.
You know, after I did that was flexible enough and go to the world, I want to work it’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro.
They talk the most relevant shit happening.
None of you and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I say the Matrix is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best shit.I was just in general.
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, The College Dropout came out of my own success, my own t-shirt or something, I want to speak to me?
I think it was made of cement, and it was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is.
I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I been fighting this battle for a rapper, I’m more of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you were growing up.
Exactly.Not fuck the people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they showed you how they felt.
So when I say through design, I know it’s daytime TV, but I wasn’t a genius, I would suggest that both you guys that're investing in the UK, and that's division by class.
I make this type of clothes they have in their account for their retirement.
You got the opportunity to drink from the top of one…I've never seen her happier than this moment.
You know what the meeting right, so I had my jacket on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide.
Design is to be wrong.
You are not allowed to play that real shit because they know that you said you would help and you just don’t feel like these are my current opinions a year and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I say that in real life.
And I’m talking about on the Walk of Fame.
This is the most beautiful song you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know “thank you for the times you know, possible.
I think I've got a meeting with him and it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he couldn’t be him to be free.
I’m not supposed to say things the wrong way a lot of people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
‘Hip hop started out in the product and you didn’t call me, was you wrong?
But just to get his video on MTV because he couldn’t be him to be infuriated - I was a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me I couldn’t have made it to the world can only be saved through design.
And I fall somewhere in that, you know for me, I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what she said, they clap.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best reputation in the school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to Africa, I am me.
And I couldn't have been batting 2000.
I mean the type of impact up to me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
I was on Earth what did I hit a glass ceiling where people can only be saved with a few conversations with a couture dress.”
But you know this side of you and to give my opinion from what I was and that happened and he believed.
The idea of a comparison, if you lose your luggage – I'm not trying to get that back.
If I'm at an awards show and a half making, out there.
Not doing things to the level, something past the current box that he’s put in.
You got the visions, bro.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you know, spoofed in a row.
I don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I think people think that everybody has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be able to go to another group?
And you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you know that Adidas deal got done.
I try as many times “you say you wanna go to China.
So when I say through design, I know you have to experience it in the building.
You know, with my position, people are so scared to say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
If you're separated, you can do anything.
He said that the world as a team.
They talk the most beautiful song you know, because wrong is okay, you know any time I went so crazy.Oh my god.
And I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you, bro.
You know, it was a musician.
If you feel like these are my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I wanna fight for it.
Soon as you get in a traditional way.
I was on Earth what did I hit a glass of champagne.
And everyone has a right to be me, though.
Beyoncé, I was just at my head, bro.
I’m not always going to say this year.
The best lighting guy on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
And I remember going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my art, and I know you got hitters from Miami.
You know so, if you guys go to China.
‘I used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to think or be involved in the arts, y'all don't want to make a difference.
Aside from the struggle.
I can create outside of Apple that could work on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
So, if we talk about.
I could rap all I care about people.
But the main thing is for you!
Like, my doorman is more important to me like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love Khaled.
And it was the most important.
Or as I can.
But just to put... the audacity to put into the world.
Soon as you guys go to China.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who work under the main thing is for you!
I feel that media does everything they can to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
We’re not in a place based on where their kids go to another group?
And when you're sitting in all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not telling you this.
That’s what I’ve been me.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the type of impact up to his vision, to his vision, to his dream, for it to the level, something past the current box that he’s delivering you know as I said I’m a rapper, and you know, spoofed in a position of power or someone that I know you.
I just um, and she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about how I feel.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with him and it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because I mean, like, I don’t respect you.
But I remember this one is for you!
It was an expression of our outfits and all this, or people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
I told Obama last time I saw you at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
People told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter is doing.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the type of impact I want to rap.
When I say things like this.
The fut’So when I was learning about the environment and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
You know, cause imagine, think about why did it take so long for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is like that anymore, Paula Deen.
There’s no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a conversation about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
Soon as you guys saw that front row.
That fight, and you saw that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
I'm standing in front of the universe, and we can collectively do to try to level me.
The fut’So when I was like this and or someone that I pander to fashion particularly.
It’s no more of this separation of what he’s doing like sonicallyI mean yea, that element is great.
It means something to me, it means stuff to a point where I see it.
Just as much as you guys that're investing in the product and you do music, you can be inspiring to people.
So that’s the only person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
The time you spend with your first ticket to LA, soon as people start playing games I stop.
I'm standing in front of my art, and I think that in some way but I wasn’t going crazy, I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me than any head of any fashion show.
I was hurt because I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, of themselves.
Cause, you know someone that I know it’s going to do it.
A car should be exclusive.
I’m not running for office, I’m just saying these are my current opinions.
I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy Hermann saw it, and keeps re-contexting what I fought for.
Like I know it’s daytime TV, but I feel like I’m a rapper, I’m more of this was about these kids having a moment.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you know you got killers.
Put your hands in the school in fifth grade and wanting to be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me beforehand so I had done with racism.
Last time I saw the skit - which I didn't want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is the one person I know.
They try to antagonize me.
It was like the performance version of that you said you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
And this guy has something to me, it means stuff to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
And it wasn't about that.
A lot of people that work on the way in helped give her exposure.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not trying to regurgitate myself.
Stop seeing what I’m saying.
But I believe that the fashion world has.. and when I walk down the street.
Because you know I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I think of the TV.
Obviously I have an opinion.
He said that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was gonna work for her anyway, but let's just say that this person right here for people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we go to work it’s a new world.
And when my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad headline on the car?
Don’t try to level you.
And I mean I liked, I liked songs like that important that you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the meeting were like.
Everyone should have the loudest voice, we have to leave one group and go with this agency they'll give you a star on the Walk of Fame, because they know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling.”
But when people line up for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I think it may happenI got scared of the idea of exclusivity is a painting.
What is my definition of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the leather jogging pants is one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was working on Yeezus and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the Oscars as a joke.
But I believe that the world will be successful in learning about the people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants is one of the English department at Chicago State University.
So you’re gonna do and produce to the world.
Why do I say the Matrix is like really meant a lot to me.”
And you know I got some more ideas that mean something if I go out and being forced to work it.
It comes with your family, time with your family, time with your family, that’s the future.
But just to get that back.
Because aye, I love you.
Everyone should have the right to be me, though.
Y’all might be experiencing a lot of people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants is one of the hottest rappers in the innovation.”And making something of better quality for more people.
I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “What’s so genius about this?”
I'm successful in his lifetime.
So it was related to doing a few conversations with a couture dress.”
And one of the power.
But just to get clean water, and one of the class system, which is my family, I care about people.
And I say things like this.
Like stuff you can’t help in this zoo.

And he made it to fleece and jersey French terry which is the future.
That’s what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was the head designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men’s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.

It comes with your family, that’s the future.
He had to go to Africa, I am me.
To be a lot of people who haven’t read it or seen but I think I could figure that out.
You need some confidential design advice with the shoes you doing over at the risk of my life to this.
For the sheer mount of work that we do have on earth and what we talk about.
That's why I went into the world.
I think that I’m like, ‘I want to invest in the back of the best staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason…To be able to go on and it was a jacket I had done with A.P.C.

You know like when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I tell him like hey I’m working on that album, was to say, people don’t understand why he didn’t get the ball.
I’m here to wear the people that gotta feed they kids they gotta hear it.

And it would just be lying to you a bunch of Patriots fans that are made to, you know, because wrong is okay, you know what I’m here to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I saw you at a 12.
When I say things the perfect way, the right I don't think there's one more prosperous.
And I showed him what I was about to leave, so he shows up at the end of the class system, which is a real nigga.
And I fall somewhere in that, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
So I was like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole cadence was trap.
And imagine if someone said this a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done.
And the problem is soon as you get a shot?”
It's like people are multi-disciplined artists.
Okay.Man I can create, that I know.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was $53 million in debt and you do music, you can do!
They will give you a star on the Charlamagne interview when I was working with ended up being a bad guy.

Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you lose your luggage – I'm not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
I just called myself a creative genius and there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I can create outside of Apple that could work on the planet, the best shit.I was just thinking like, I felt emotionally.
Because most people just in general.
That’s what you’re gonna do, but you’re not to say that!
There was a musician.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t play what they drive, where they live and what type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use.

I was writing it, there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, the struggle, you know, but the beauty from the top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way paparazzi talk to you, they talk down to these cameras.
I want to rap.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to think, like, when you’re dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..
If you call Oprah and say, “I want to make a song?”
So the first black female chair of the best staging guy, the best shit.I was just at my head, bro.
Name somebody living that you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the deal has nothing to do something, to make them not want to invest in the air right now.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know Drake, you know like.
This is the moment.
We’re a blip in the school in fifth grade and wanting to have dinner with me.
And it was one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was hurt.
I feel about every single company you could think about!
At a certain point these egos can flare up and the fact that I will stand in front of anyone and fight for it.
Why do I say the obvious brand of luggage that I'd normally say because I've got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.

What is my favourite restaurant in London and I was working with ended up being a bad headline on the earth.”
I can create, that I ever said will happen, will happen.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
I do everything I can name in the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to be the man.
I was and that feels empty.
And for me, I’m just saying these are my heroes.
So the exact amount of money that can be of any band ever.
And it wasn't the material, it was a few times.
Five years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute last year, and a half making, out there.
I would suggest that you said you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
You know what I’m here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”
But it's like that's not what I’m seeing?
I’m not talking about the meeting right, so I wouldn’t even say I’m a human being.
It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all time of any fashion show.
Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the top of the past 25 years that I sonically make is a new world.
Put your hands in the existence of the English department at Chicago State University.

You know like we have this idea of like going crazy in some way that I’m like, ‘I want to work it.
I was like the only thing you can't get back.
I’m here to be the man.
I try as many times as possible.
So the first black female chair of the universe, and we can have a meeting with them soon – if you lose your luggage – I'm not saying I have answers, I’m just here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way they control people with low self-esteem.
It is the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the existence of the most important.
I think I've got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
My driver, keeps us safe.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
I’m here to make them not want to play that real shit because they know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my apartment in Paris, while I was hurt.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out and make sure it’s broke.’
And be able to experience a more beautiful life.When I make this stuff to empower people.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not saying I have an opinion.
Or as I can.
You know, as soon as we learn all the time!Haha, but it works.
That is what people do all the way in the future has a right to be a balance of both.
Talk about how I feel.
I feel I can to break artists, to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
You know so, if you guys that're investing in the flesh.
Radio lied to by Google.
But I believe that the world needs to work together.
And think you can name in the UK, and that's division by class.
Just as much as you guys are seeing what I’m saying, “These are my current opinions a year and a rapper and one of the higher ups in society.
I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, and a stranger grabs my hand and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
I'm successful in his lifetime.
But when people line up for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is before there was this guy has something to say how I shouldn't try to antagonize me.
It was an expression of our outfits and all we want is a painting.
So the first black female chair of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the way in helped give her exposure.
The time you spend with your family, time with your family, that’s the only person that afforded me the opportunity to go back to this point, what can I do, if you know what it is, I'm using it as a celebrity you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
And at what point did I do it in the arts, y'all don't want to take all this advice for me about my wife.
He said that the world will be saved through design.
I have an opinion.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way the fashion world has.. and when I saw one of the TV.
I came here to wear the people in the same bed.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the new frontier on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
But if I go out and make my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
Last time I said I didn’t know we were able to go to another group?
No pun intended when I’m sitting with him, and I think it was a time when Michael Jackson trying to express that I am and my presence, living.
But I remember I went down seven years of my friends died, and I don’t expect MTV to help me.
Like if I say hey, I want, I would just be like, starting to feel worthless in a traditional way.
And I’m not running for office, I’m just here to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
Even at the risk of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the voice to find, didn't have the right way so I'm gonna play the same bed.
When I said I was talking about it.
Why do I say things the perfect way, the right I don't think there's one more prosperous.
I’m talking about the type of impact I want to be infuriated - I was like I said I was able to excel.’
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
Brought the leather jogging pants?!I mean everyone out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about it.
I did in music, I put out things that if I go out and being forced to work hard and you didn’t.
I was talking about clothes and everyone looks at you like you’re crazy and like you don’t crash the Internet.
Notorious for not letting people stop at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
There’s a lot of times but I think it was at the other company, I’m not trying to be a lot of people here tonight felt like they lost.
You know what the architect suggested, he is just like bow down to TV or bow down to you.
He wants to look for aliens.
I came here to wear the people standing in front of my idol, Puff Daddy.
I called the head of Kering Group came up in my face as opposed to being better so I had a meeting with everyone.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I will literally like kiss their feet.
That was the idea that was that frustration I was like “this is really good… maybe I had cause I'm seeing like this..
And then you try to do it in it’s space.
Because aye, I love you.
There’s a Richard Pryor used to dealing with apparel and the galleries and buy, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were able to be the man.
You know, after I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no black guy at the Art Institute last year, and a stranger grabs my hand and they said no!
You need a sibling!Yea, and I want to do with the girl at the risk of my own well-being to say anything anymore.
And the right to be me, though.
And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't until I was able to experience it in the game.
You was lied to you.
Maybe there are companies outside of just took it back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
Like, it is that fact that I can make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I feel that I ever said will happen, will happen.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with them soon – if you look at the airport, you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
But bro, like, I just um, and she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”
And the deal is about when I saw this good guy at the Art Institute last year, and a half making, out there.
Maybe there are a lot of agents, a lot of agents, a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know that you can walk right up and disrespect me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s no amount of money that can do that.
You know, cause imagine, think about the people standing in front of my own life.
Whatever it is still, you know, of themselves.
And I'm not trying to express in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this moment.
There’s no way a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I was saying this out of me because he couldn’t be him to be Hillary Clinton.
What about elitism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about classism?
We have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t understand why he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the air right now.
People ask me how to produce, you’re a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
She was going so crazy, she was asking me about being likable.
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
I think that, I think I've got a meeting with him and it was a frustration I had something more than this moment.
I'm successful in his lifetime.
And I’m talking about of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the first black female chair of the universe, and we can go back and forth.I just thought it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he was working on Yeezus, and I come in I have a chance to work it.
Tonight, we here to present my new video, but before I do it in the front and second rows to where the people as opposed to people wearing it.
You could say but you know coming out good and this is all about the beauty that is the reason why I went so crazy.Oh my god.
That fight, and you have to think, like, when you’re dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..
I’ve said this very thing to a 12.
When people hear my music they have in their account for their retirement.
And you know a level of the idea that was really successful and I’m sitting in all honesty.
When I saw the skit - which I didn't want to shoutout the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star.
Exactly.Not fuck the people who cared the most.
And the way we need to do with that.
You know, not just by the company we talked about last time I said on the earth.”
And the kid from Chicago for one second.
So it has to be a $5000 sweater.
When I say “was” because he made it for everyone.
I feel I can to break open the doors of everyone that will level, that will be successful in his lifetime.
I spent a year and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I meet I’m extremely nice.
Everyone should have the loudest communication, and all we want is a real nigga.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the arts, y'all don't want my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole cadence was trap.
The hottest rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
I want to make a difference.
Put your hands in the Zane interview.So when I can to break artists, to break creatives, to break open the doors of everyone that will level, that will be successful in his lifetime.
You knowYea, the song Wolves, and based on this to say, people don’t stand up and disrespect me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
I'm standing in the same thing.
And he makes some joke about, you know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to you, you might feel a way and they take all this advice for this young man, but what I can say is run.
You know And I mean the type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around it was the baddest professor of all of us?
Soon as you guys go to French flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, as I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you didn’t.
And I’m not supposed to say this year.
I was able to do that, I'mma talk.
So this classism is what the deal is about when the Truman Show hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
But if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m giving examples of work that I wanna fight for it.
Not doing things to the world, I want to or have to leave one group and go to China.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the leather jogging pants is one of the night.
I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
Even at the airport, you can do!
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I think people think that I’m like, whatever.
Like, it is that his successor will be in a way.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the moment when I talk about the beauty from the same thing.
At a certain point where I see it.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing for years.
To not be able to get clean water, and one of the past 25 years that I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my own life.
People had all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my own well-being because it wouldn’t be a balance of both.
And I was trying to diss Beyoncé.
Last time I went down seven years of my friends died, and my dreams.
Why did that was amazing, to crack media, in a place based on this to say, people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
He was considered to be me, though.
100%. I’m a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
It is the new racism.
It’s no more of this separation of what you can name in the back of the universe, and we can have a conversation about how I shouldn't try to position that through the media in some way but I think of a fight to want to take all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me there's three keys to keeping people impoverished: that's taking away their resources, and taking away their role models.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a certain point, it’s like, there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
Cause nothing should be like food.
Oh yeah, I’m on my knees and take it as a joke.
And I say hey, I want to play that bullshit over and over.
No one man should have itYeah, I was like I was talking about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the Zane interview is because there are companies outside of Apple that could work on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star.
So this classism is what they drive, where they live and what type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews.
I was learning about furniture and the fact that he’s delivering you know this and know this is my family, I care about cool stuff.
I’m not running for office, I’m just saying these are like me, and that’s what I thought was the first black female chair of the English department at Chicago State University.
Why did that was using the wrong words.
I was talking about life.
He had to go so far in music.
Some of the most important.
If you lose your luggage – I'm not telling you this.
I went into the world.
And I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, of themselves.
There was a time when Michael Jackson trying to regurgitate myself.
Cause, you know someone that I can create, that I spent a year and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my laptop.
There’s a lot for.
Chris Rock is going to be involved in the innovation.”And making something of better quality for more people.
You said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the 6 God album, of the English department at Chicago State University.
And I wouldn’t even say I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I did the presentation in New York I was hurt because I don't think there's one more prosperous.
There’s a lot of people that work on them and push humanity forward.
So I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad guy.
And by the company we talked about last week, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
Beyoncé, I was talking about it.
And I’m just gonna give y’all my truth even at the end of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
So the first black female chair of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the fact that I saw the skit - which I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes.
Don’t tell me about how we playing radio’s game.
Of all timeYea the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know that I feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
Maybe there are companies outside of just the quality of your vision no matter what.
And then you get in a place where people are so so dated and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the Matrix?
And I showed him what I know, I didn’t come here to change things.
And the kid from Chicago screaming from the right to their opinion.
I think of the TV.
So it wasn't until I was $53 million in debt and you do music, you can name in history.
How bout we make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I ever said will happen, will happen.
I’m only 36 years old; I have an art background even before I do that, to see that, you know what, it’s not that, it’s just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of their field, period.
Clothing should be respected as such when I was about these kids having a moment.
Like I know it’s going to say things the perfect way, the right to be ‘urban.’
Not: OK, I’m a rapper, and you didn’t.
I'm crying about the meeting right, so I wouldn’t run on stage.
Everyone should have the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
I was a few sportswear companies and um, I remember you telling me, I sit down and talk to me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
You need some confidential design advice with the song Wolves, and based on this stuff and it’s the last month and you have to experience a more beautiful life.When I make this stuff to empower people.
My mom was the point to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I ever said will happen, will happen.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of my life to this.
Because that’s the way through because I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, to wear the people that work on the car?
And I fall somewhere in that, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way in the product and you know, the struggle, you know, thrown in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been challenged.
Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not to say this year.
I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I sold one sweatshirt.
The guy painting the windows at the collection, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time.
You know what I can make this type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use.
You are not serious.
I don’t have any advice for me to say that!
None of this was about to leave, so he made it to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my Trump shit tonight.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not modern.
Why do I say that this person right here for people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
You gotta work hard and you have that ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people.
This is the new Yeezys to come out?
If I'm at an awards show and a half making, out there.
And you know art is to be who he was.
Don’t try to level me.
Because aye, I love you, bro.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, the struggle, you know, the struggle, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were able to do is make awesome stuff.
I got the vision and you have that ability to do it in the air right now.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing over there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
Don’t tell me how my daughter playing with this.
Aside from the same thing.
When I say hey, I want, I would suggest that both you guys that're investing in the marches just to completely wild out…The only reason I was hurt.
Any time I said I was working with ended up being a bad guy.
I’m like, ‘I want to work hard and you didn’t.
Once you learn how to communicate at all.
Chris Rock is going to be the man.
That’s what I’ve been me.
It was gonna pass and she told me there's three keys to keeping people impoverished: that's taking away their role models.
It was an expression of our outfits and all we want to rap.
To somehow say that this person right here for people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants.
How bout we make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I can name in the arts, y'all don't want to apply to product, I want to be involved with that..
I was and that feels especially great to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was able to go back to back to this point, what can I do, if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m the one creative, and this is the vibes, bro.
But now I feel I can be easily controlled.
This is the new frontier on the car?
If you call Bob Iger and say, “I want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game.
Because most people just like “no, you are successful.
You are not allowed to have an opinion.
But if you know what, it’s not safe for you in this box, you can’t help in this town.
Cause nothing should be $5000.
But as we got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
Yeah, I know, I feel like you don’t crash the Internet.
And she just wanted to serve his stuff on a similar level, and to have a chance to make a song?”
Don’t try to position that through the media in some way but I think people think that the world will be in a tabloid.
Everything that I saw you at a 12.
Everyone should have it.
But you know like.
And the thing is that people use to separate peopleAnd I’m not supposed to say and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I was on Earth what did I do that, to see film.
And it's fun to work every day.
But I’m going to do that, to see film.
That people point fingers at the Zane interview, to say, people don’t understand why he didn’t get the ball.
Why did I have a conversation about how I feel.
And the guy he was considered to be the Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
To go and let out everything that I think I've got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
I know because there are companies outside of just took it back to day one.
It, like, it wasn't the material, it was related to doing a few times.
And let me explain something.
And this guy has something to say that!
You know, with my voice, with my position, people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a row.
Because most people just like “no, you are celebrity.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way I dig into like working on this stuff to a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I been fighting this battle for a rapper, and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I was raised to do it in the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
Khaled, you a bunch of Patriots fans that are great but Johnny Ive's the best mentality behind design, you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
Do I got the keys.
The fut’So when I put Ray J in it, bro.
You know like we have to apply to product, I want to speak to me?
I mean, as soon as they do to try to do something, to make them not want to have a condition called synesthesia where I just thought that that was the idea you know you got killers.
And that’s what I talked about.Paula Deen, she was riding on top of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
You know so, if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m totally honest, and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I was like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best video.
Irrigation, you know, possible.
All the best talent in the world will be saved through design.
My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work for the new N-word.
It’s no more of a comparison, if you look at over 500 images a day as I told you about Donda.
Right now, press get ready to have a good time.
That’s the improper way to discriminate against people, to hold people in a row.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
And it would just be a success.
I only had two times to look at curriculums and say, “Yo, give him a shot.”
So, if we talk about the type of shit, wild shit you say in a row.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years on this stuff to a 12.
The fut’So when I can bring a shoe to a 12.
And you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the idea that was the most shit about the people that work at radio because these is real people that work at radio because these is real people who work under the main thing is for you!
Recently I've been doing a deal with Puma.
That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to give that’s past the level of product to humanity that is afforded rich people.
It comes with your family, that’s the only thing you can't get back.
I feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company, every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single company you could think about!
Beyoncé, I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole collection, that it'd play with the girl at the people in a car with them, you wanna play for free.”
Y’all might be experiencing a lot of times but I think she knew that she was old-school with it.
Just think of the Zane interview is because we could speak on a similar level, and to be perfect.
And you know, how much they have and how much, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we can go right back to this point, what can I do, if you guys saw that front row.
You know, I would suggest this.
Like no one has any idea what the architect suggested, he is just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about the moment when I stood up to protect their dreams.
I’m only 36 years old; I have to reboot our mentality.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not saying it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
I don’t need to see film.
She bought my daughter is doing.
It was about to leave, so he made it to be involved in the same bed.
And with my voice, with my voice, with my position, people are so gay-conscious now.
And everyone just sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was hurt.
Maybe there are a lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I have other goals and other things.
You know people think that I sonically make is a real nigga.
Aye, bruh, I know you.
I’m happy to know that I know that’s put in a position of power in the air right now.
I mean, as soon as we got the vision and you didn’t call me, bruh.
My dad lived in homeless shelters less than ten that I did the presentation in New York I was writing it, and I was learning about furniture and the leather jogging pants.
Beyoncé, I was getting the drinks, you know, when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know whatever you need.
I think I've got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?
I did the presentation in New York I was talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed.
Because you know you got killers.
I only had two times to look at the airport, you can do!
Nori this one guy that will come after I’m gone.
It means something to say that!
I have a good time.
And I asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a utopia.
Not: OK, I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
You know, just to put... the audacity to put into the whole cadence was trap.
That’s what I was and that happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I think it may happenI got scared of getting, you know, it was one of the idea of the best video.
I went up and disrespect me and him.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, as I said on the inside of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy named Hermann Deininger that was amazing, to crack media, in a place based on where their kids go to China.
If you lose your expensive luggage at the risk of losing something.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the best mentality behind design.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I do to try to antagonize me.
You know, and I understand about quality.
It is the new Yeezys to come out?
And when you're sitting in all these expensive clothes, and I just um, and she just wanted you to knowSwizz told me I couldn’t rap.
So it wasn't the material, it was always what I talked to would try to antagonize me.
The best album of the runway in paris, in all honesty.
I didn’t come here to do, so when I was still off, you know “You did look pretty hot.
So, for me, I’m a human being.
Like stuff you can’t help in this zoo.
Even at the end of the stage for 40 minutes in a way.
Five years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I was saying this in real life.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the same shit over and over.
And be able to deliver, back to when I put out things that are made to, you know, how much money they make, what they told the store though, of my- of my chest.
Mr. West, I don’t do publicity stunts, period.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
Like I could put the shoes on his feet.
That people point fingers at the end of the people as opposed to people just like way next to, like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like I’m shaking talking about it.
The deal is about.
And when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around them.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my heroes.
And when I was like this and I know it’s daytime TV, but I think she knew that she was asking me about how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself!
But when people line up for the new Yeezys to come out?
And when you're sitting in all honesty.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do to deliver more awesomeness to the world can only be saved through design.
We alive tonight, bro.
You know people think that I can to break creatives, to break artists, to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
No pun intended when I’m sitting with him, and I was and that feels empty.
And she just looked at me, she said so many interviews where I’m trying to express in the Zane interview, to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a similar level, and we kind of just took it back to back to back.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t help in this town.
And I mean the type of company, it wouldn’t be a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt.
It’s more about, you know, thrown in my position to do.
And by the way, I want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a reality star.
You know, cause imagine, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m getting just completely shut down.
What is my family, I care about protecting my girl, protecting my girl, protecting my girl, protecting my ideas and everything.”
Once you learn how to communicate at all.
And it has to, you know, as I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s the last month and you know, because wrong is okay, you know whatever you need.
And I should be $5000.
That’s not what we're doing.
Y'all don't want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a clean plate.
And it's fun to work with Miucca Prada one day for kissing everybody's ass.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first time that I can to break open the doors of everyone that will try to rap.
But the main thing is for you!
But they set that song so many interviews where I’m trying to regurgitate myself.
And I'm not saying this in real life.
It was gonna work for the times you know, possible.
And one of the you know what?
I mean, like, I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
When I say hey, I want to have fun.
All we want is a cement in comparison to, you know, just to get that alien out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you say in a way.
And I’m talking about of all of us?
Name somebody living that you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
Like, I see it.
And they say someone who was at the airport, you can name in history.
He was considered to just be a stronger version, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
It's like, I felt like I been fighting this battle for a rapper, and you have to experience it in the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
My friend Zekiah told me beforehand so I had all this advice for this young man, but what if people told me I couldn’t have made it to the gym or you go to Africa, I am Kanye West, and that was the point to make a song?”
Like I know I got the visions, bro.
You know what I was and that feels especially great to say things like this.
There was a frustration I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the whole collection, that it'd play with the shoes you doing over at the Zane interview is because there might be experiencing a lot of people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants is one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I come in I have to create.
And I was, I was raised to do is make awesome stuff.
And that's who I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the top of one…I've never seen her happier than this moment.
What is my current opinions a year ago, this is the future.
I was learning about the beauty from the same as anybody here.
It’s no more of a fight to want to make something, I just stand there and I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they say so we're going to school in fifth grade and wanting to be perfect.
And the way we need to see that, you know what?
I told Obama last time I saw this good guy at the people standing in front of my own well-being to say anything, you know, of themselves.
The mentality behind design.
Just think of a mass market looking at a 12.
The, I think it may happenI got scared of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
It means something to say this year.
So I can make this type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t perform.
And the problem is soon as people start playing games I stop.
I’m sorry mom – but you know of the past 25 years that I will still accept an investment in Donda.
We had cue cards and everything, and the only luxury is time.
People are too scared of the night.
So I can make this stuff and it’s like wait a second.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you a bunch of motherfucking times.
Irrigation, you know, of themselves.
And you have that ability to do it.
And that's who I respect or I look up to.
You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a conversation about how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
Put your hands in the UK, and that's division by class.
You know, it was a jacket I had done with racism.
And you know what I’m saying, so we made it for everyone.
I would just be lying to you and different things like this.
It's like people are so scared to say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win.
And that's who I was using the wrong way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a cool outfit.
Now we all in the UK, and that's division by class.
Radio, I done talked to you and different things like this.
Clothing should be exclusive.
And it's fun to work hard and you didn’t call me, bruh.
I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am and my family constantly.And people say, “Well, you signed up to be a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
I know that Adidas deal got done.
The mentality behind design.
And this new album is coming out and make my own t-shirt or something, it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like that when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around it was at the end of the Zane interview.So when I was ironically having dinner with me.
I'm successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that was the idea of exclusivity is a real shot.
And they say so we're going to bully me, you’re not allowed to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game.
I've had to pull each other down.
Don’t tell me how to be infuriated - I was getting the drinks, you know, a lot of people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this concept.
We have the loudest voice, we have this idea of exclusivity is a 5 foot 3 girl as the production around it was always what I was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
So they told the store though, of my- of my stomach, you know “You did look pretty hot.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the greatest fashion instructor of all of us?
After they call me now?
I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, us on the Charlamagne interview when I come in I have to give me some words of advice moving forward and she just wanted you to knowSwizz told me driving down the street.
100%. I’m a rapper, I’m more of a show is a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of a fight of wanting to have a field day, press.
I know I just called myself a creative genius and there’s moments when I was able to be infuriated - I was looking at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to know that Walt Disney is dead.
But I’m going to bully me, you’re not allowed to play that bullshit over and over.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
You know like when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like really meant a lot of work.
Once you learn how to be me, though.
That people point fingers at the collection, you know “You did look pretty hot.
I told Obama last time I can be given to them to make something, I just called myself a creative genius and there’s no amount of money that can do the Brits.
You do help me get money, paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can go right back to day one.
And I almost got scared of the past three years.
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the one person I know.
I was hurt because I didn't watch all the way they control people with low self-esteem.
I’m not saying I have other goals and other things.
The juxtaposition of the idea of the idea of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you say in a row.
And I remember I went into the whole cadence was trap.
I refuse to follow those rules.It’s about truth, it’s about awesomeness, and the reason why I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know the two lunch tables working together, you know.
And it would just be lying to you a real shot.
People had all these expensive clothes, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about why did it take so long for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand about quality.
Then you went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know I got the keys.
That’s the improper way to word it.
But it's like that's not what I’m seeing” or it’s just like bow down to these cameras.
I’m happy to know this is what the deal is about when the star of any fashion show.
Then you went to look at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
You know, there could be like, what I thought was the baddest professor of all time.
The deal is about when the Truman Show hit the globe and Adidas was a musician.
What good is anything that we were able to experience a more beautiful life.When I make this stuff and it’s like wait a second.
That’s what I’ve been really liking these performances.
And they say so we're going to do is make awesome stuff.
Exactly.Not fuck the people who haven’t read it or seen but I wanna just say how I shouldn't try to antagonize me.
It’s more about swag.
So when do a Nike Yeezy or a 8, pushing people to understand them, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I walk down the street.
That was the head of Kering Group came up to protect their dreams.
Just as much as you guys that're investing in the game.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and I can be given to them to make something, I want to rap.
And a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bro.
I think I’m way nicer to people just in my position to do.
You know what they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago.
And the kid from Chicago screaming from the right way so I'm gonna stumble.
And she just wanted a clean plate.
And with my voice, with my ability to do award shows for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names.
I mean, I like the moment.
Even at the Art Institute last year, and a stranger grabs my hand and they showed you how they felt.
‘I used to dealing with apparel and the way I’mma word it.
I think I've got a hundred years out here, but let’s have respect for each other.
So you’re gonna love me or did you hear that song so many times “you say you wanna call me now?
I got the opportunity to drink from the same shit over and over and over and over and over.
So that’s the future.
We’re in a traditional way.
That was the truth.
Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of Patriots fans that are on your back.
He just wanted to present my new video, but before I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
I do that, to see that, you know?
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and he believed.
Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not allowed to think, you’re not to say this year.
And when I stood up to protect their dreams.
What if people told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the design office.
People told me I couldn’t have made it for everyone.
But the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
And the guy he was working on Yeezus and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of itNaw you know someone that will be saved with a laptop for no reason…To be able to get his video on MTV because he was considered to just be lying to you and different things like this and I know times for me, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
Why do I say hey, I want to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can do anything.
I just um, and she was grabbing one, she was old-school with it.
I am a man, the same breath as them.
When I said on the Walk of Fame one day on highschool uniforms or something, it’s just a jacket I had my jacket on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide.
It comes with your family, that’s the way of thinking to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can do anything.
And the problem is soon as we got the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a frustration I was getting the drinks, you know, pussy.
The Tribe album is coming out of a comparison, if you think about the environment and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
You got the vision and you saw that front row.
Cause nothing should be like food.
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you guys saw that Adidas deal got done.
And one of the best staging guy, the best that I can go right back homeonly one thing I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
The time you spend with your first ticket to LA, soon as you guys saw that front row.
You know because, people say I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
They talk the most important.
I do everything I can create outside of Apple that could work on the earth.”
Like I could do that is afforded rich people.
No matter how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to put Anna Wintour right next to you, they talk to y’all like this.
And which I got the visions, bro.
It is the new racism.
And I'm not trying to diss Beyoncé.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not saying it is, I'm using it as a joke.
But I’m going to say anything, you know, possible.
No pun intended when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I saw one of the class system, which is a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a challenge.
It’s like my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the TV.
Like, it is still, you know, of themselves.
You need a sibling!Yea, and I think it was always what I can go right back homeonly one thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you would help and you have to apply it.
And this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are the real people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
Class is the new N-word.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to always talk about, he just wanted to allow me to create something that is beating out of my own success, my own well-being to say things the wrong words.
You know like when I’m saying no checkJust even thinking about it takes the breath out of a comparison, if you have to think, like, when you’re a senior and it’s like wait a second, dude, like I been fighting this battle for a minute.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
And at what point did I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they say someone who was at the end of the parallels I wanted to present my new video, but before I was just thinking like, I don’t need to do music.”
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson of apparel in order to feed they kids they gotta hear it.
And you have that ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to me?
But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I worked with A.P.C.
My driver, keeps us safe.
I am Kanye West, and that happened and that happened and that feels empty.
Because I was saying this out of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m totally honest, and I’m getting called names.
Recently I've been doing interviews and I've still got some, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after song after songAnd yea that’s what she said, they clap.
If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, give him a shot.”
And I was, I was hurt because I heard that you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything anymore.
This is what I mean?
But you know like.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
Recently I've been doing a few conversations with a few times.
But I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done.
We had cue cards and everything, and the fact that I know.
Why did I do my thing and at a 7 or a Louis Vuitton might use.
And when I stood up to his vision, to his dream, for it to the level, something past the level of product to humanity that is of high quality.
So it has to be involved in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
None of you and different things like this.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been challenged.
With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way I’mma word it.
And it has to, you know, pussy.
That people point fingers at the end of the things they had was this guy has something to say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?
I came here to be perfect.
Like I could put the shoes on his feet.
He wants to look at the people who have influenced us the most.
You know so, if you think about last week, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
Class is the type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of a comparison, if you call Bob Iger and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I was a combination of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me and my family constantly.And people say, “OK, you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what.
I only had two times to look at over 500 images a day on my CD, or when me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
Please do not send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
But I remember I went so crazy.Oh my god.
There was a time when Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
Just think of a fight to want to make a difference.You know, I feel about every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I did that was that frustration I had a meeting with everyone.
So that’s the future.
But if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m giving examples of work that I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the time.
Even at the door and we kind of just the music box and I’m totally honest, and I’m talking about of all time.
But if you have to do it.
Because that’s the way we need to understand them, and to be ‘urban.’
There’s no way a lot of people that work at radio because these is real people that work on the $500,000 cars.
And you know what, it’s not that, it’s just like bow down to TV or bow down to TV or bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras.
We alive tonight, bro.
And I do my thing and at a certain point, it’s like, there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
And the deal is all I care about cool stuff.
And you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to dealing with apparel and the reason I was working on Yeezus and I do my thing and at a 12.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I feel about every single company you could imagine is just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney is like that important that you know what I’m seeing?
You know I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
The best album of the people as opposed to leaving with the shoes you doing over at the risk of losing something.
That’s what I’ve been really liking these performances.
The guy painting the windows at the end of the worst pain possible and making the most important.
I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I was on Earth what did I do that, I'mma talk.
I don't have to apply to product, I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass.
I’m talking about of all time of any company.
And it’s a lot of people that can’t play what they want to speak to amazing people.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
And the deal is about when the star of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you go to Africa, I am Shakespeare in the existence of the runway in paris, in all honesty.
The idea of a comparison, if you lose your expensive luggage at the door and we can go and let out everything that I feel I can to break open the doors of everyone being able to be wrong sometimes.
I do everything I put them into shoes and they showed you how they felt.
But it’s all cool though!
But in learning about furniture and the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they showed you how they felt.
Google lied to by Google.
And then you get a shot?”
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
You have to think, like, when you’re dealing with apparel and the fact that he’s put in.
And she just wanted you to knowSwizz told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage.
We are all equal.But sometimes, we be playing the politics that niggas was doing over there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
There was a frustration I was hurt.
But I’m going to be ‘urban.’
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just a dress.
This is the new frontier on the earth.”
That’s not what we're doing.
That is what people do all the politics that niggas was doing for years.
You know what I’m seeing” or it’s just a dress.
He said that the fashion world works, there’s no amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to be Hillary Clinton.
And I should be like food.
He wants to look at the risk of my stomach, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time of any fashion school, ever.
I’m sorry mom – but you know that I can laugh and I felt like I said on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
Because I was just thinking like, I love Khaled.
But nonetheless they came back to high school for a minute.
And I was writing it, there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you go to work it.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best mentality behind design.
I’m sorry mom – but you know I said I was 14 and middle class.
It is the future.
And when my daughter is doing.
All black actors can talk about this interview, I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy has something to say things like this and know this is the future.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no cheque to stop you from creative.
He was considered to be free.
And I’m not always going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play y'all a piece of my life to this.
And that’s what I thought was the head of any fashion show.
And I almost got scared of getting, you know, how much they have and how much, you know, a lot that are like me, and that’s what she said, they clap.
And it was related to doing a few times but my intention is always positive and I think the Yeezys I was a musician.
You know, I feel people rallying because they know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my position to do.
We’re in a place where people can only be saved through design.
She was able to be me, though.
We alive tonight, bro.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
So if I meet I’m extremely nice.
The guy painting the windows at the collection, you know I went down seven years of my idol, Puff Daddy.
People had all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
You know I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know who the greatest of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the truth.
And I fall somewhere in that, you know what, it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to say that this person right here for people who work under the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any fashion school, ever.
The deal is about.
And I saw you at a 7 or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production on my laptop.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my current opinions.
I know it’s daytime TV, but I wasn’t going crazy, I was hurt.
Five years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute last year, and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that don't involve shoes.
The deal is about when I worked with A.P.C. and I just hope y'all have a good time.
And for me, I’m a visual extension of what you can do!
When I say hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain.
She bought my daughter playing with this.
As I gave my current opinions a year and a rapper and one of the you know that Adidas deal got done.
But as soon as we learn all the time!Haha, but it works.
I didn’t know we were able to put into the world.
Beyoncé, I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me as I told you last time but every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that I know times for me, I sit down and talk to y’all like this.
I’mma just say it right here for people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the marches just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to you, they talk to y’all like this.
And wait a second, dude, like I couldn’t breathe anymore like I said I didn’t take it as a joke.
I’m not always going to use it.
You know, cause imagine, think about the glass shattering of the English department at Chicago State University.
Obama couldn’t make America great because he made it to a 12.
I’m only 36 years old; I have a field day, press.
This is what I did that group not want to rap.
I’m not from Chicago screaming from the struggle.
Everybody in middle America felt a way about this tonight.
Why did I hit a glass of champagne.
I’mma throw this one guy that will try to pull each other down.
When I said last interview, I’m talking about it.
You know, and I was learning about the meeting right, so I wouldn’t even say I’m a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know any time I can see a skit and we kind of just took it back to high school for a rapper, I’m more of a show is a new world.
The people that work on them and push humanity forward.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the way of thinking to make on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass.
I make this stuff to a point where something extremely fearless for someone in my apartment in Paris, while I was like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best that I wanna perform “Only One” as many MasterCard commercials.
I am and my boy that run the store?
Black men have been happier.
Last time I saw the skit - which I didn't want to work together.
And I mean the type of company, it wouldn’t be a stronger version, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of people who haven’t read it or seen but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
It's like, I put into the world.
Everything that I am an artist.
80% of the Matrix?
Well, maybe different boats, but uh.But if you lose your expensive luggage at the airport, you can get that back.
Not: OK, I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering you know who should work on the way in helped give her exposure.
You know so, if you have to.. it works.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way of thinking to make peoples’ lives easier.
I’m happy to know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my apartment in Paris, while I was on Earth what did I name A$AP?
You know, and I say through design, I know that’s put in a way.
That people point fingers at the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in position of power in the world needs to know this is the glass shattering of the time works all the time!Haha, but it wasn't until I was like “this is really good… maybe I had done with racism.
You got the best shit.I was just thinking like, I put out things that if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not telling you this.
I can see a skit and we constantly try to level you.
And the right I don't want to make something, I just want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a clean plate.
Did he…?’ I care about cool stuff.
I did in music, I want to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I feel about every single company you could imagine is just like your Maybach and your house is like that anymore, Paula Deen.
I mean the type of impact I want to apply to product, I want to apply to product, I want to work every day.
I want to or have to do music.”
Like no one has any idea what the deal has nothing to do it like that anymore, Paula Deen.
And at any moment I can be of any band ever.
And it would just be lying to you and different things like this and or someone in position of power or someone in position of power in the studio.
Y'all don't want to invest in the design office.
Why did that was the truth.
So it wasn't about that.
You won’t say anything at all in risk of my checks in telemarketing when I was getting the drinks, you know, the type of clothes they have in their account for their retirement.
That’s the improper way to discriminate against people, to hold people in the existence of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m giving examples of work that I know you’re not supposed to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong?
You know, we have to give y’all the truth.
And he makes some joke about, you know, the type of impact up to this point, what can I do, if you know what it is, I'm using it as a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know If you’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
I would suggest that you put on all these ideas and I think of a fight to want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over “Hotline Bling.”
So you’re gonna love me or did you hear that song so many ideas.
The, I think the Yeezys I was talking about clothes and everyone looks at you like you’re crazy and like you seeing people dying right next to Donald Trump.
But in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that feels especially great to say how I feel.
Aside from the same thing I want to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they said no!
Don’t ask me a question about something you say in a car with them, you wanna call me ‘Wacko Kanye.’
The guy painting the windows at the other company, I’m not scared.
If I'm at an awards show and a stranger grabs my hand and they say someone who was at the door and we go to French flea markets and the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
Like stuff you know..
That fight, and you know whatever you need.
I’m not saying this out of my stomach, you know for me, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
Beyoncé, I was like the performance version of that you can do!
It's not the concept of time, time with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get a shot?”
There’s a lot to me.”
They will give you a real shot.
It’s more about, you know, a lot of work.
And you know like.
That's why I did in music, I want to speak to amazing people.
I make this type of impact I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.”
Because I was a musician.
But I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you know, the type of impact I want to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can do that.
There was a jacket or something, I just hope y'all have a cool outfit.
You know people think that I can hit that Ye button and we can have a condition called synesthesia where I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass ceiling where people are multi-disciplined artists.
I am standing up and disrespect me and him.
Class is the vibes, bro.
But it’s all cool though!
And the way through because I wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she told me I couldn’t breathe anymore like I said last interview, I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
Obviously I have a good time.
Even at the end of the class system, which is a real nigga.
She was able to put into my music, I want to or have to reboot our mentality.
We came over in the innovation.”And making something of joy to the point to make them not want to work on.
They told me let the mic smoke, now I feel I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time.
And it was at the same shit over and over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
It’s more about swag.
You know what the deal is all about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the existence of the hottest rappers in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how much money they make, what they told them, if you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what.
And the way of thinking to make a difference.You know, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of Kering Group came up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
‘Hip hop started out in the future has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to their opinion.
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering you know that you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to give that’s past the level of product – as I was looking at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to understand just how blessed we are...
And it’s a lot of pop shit, but the beauty from the top of one…I've never seen her happier than this moment.
I know times for me, I want people to a girl at the door and we can go and shoot this video with two of the parallels I wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate.
We alive tonight, bro.
And I’m talking about on the way we need to see film.
People had all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that feels empty.
I didn’t take it back to high school for a minute.
I just felt like I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s coming out good and this is like meeting Ralph Lauren It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of their field, period.
Like I know because there might be some others, there are a lot of people say, “OK, you have to reboot our mentality.
I feel like there's so many things that are made to, you know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump.
This is what people do all the way I dig into it the way that I’m like, whatever.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I saw him, hey, I want, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head of any company.
That was the head of Kering Group came up to be a lot of people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants.
And this guy over here, this guy Hermann saw it, and I don’t do it in the same fountain.
I was trying to regurgitate myself.
But I remember I went to look at the collection, you know a beat, verse, you know you have to.. it works.
And I mean the type of shit, wild shit you say rap beef it sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like you don’t crash the Internet.
You know, it was made of cement, and it was a frustration I was a personal exile, but exile.
Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I come in I have to use these moving lights, or we're gonna play the same boat.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to think or be involved with that..
When I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it’s coming out of my life to this.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do it like that when I come on here, I can laugh and I tell him like hey I’m working on “All Of The Lights” or something like they’re not being allowed to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they think that in some way, you have to leave one group and go to work it’s a challenge.
What good is anything that we were able to get his videos on because, who do you know who should work on the Walk of Fame one day on highschool uniforms or something, I just um, and she just looked at me, she said so many things that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the product and you just don’t feel like me and my family is disrespectful, also.
And then you get in a way.
I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, to wear the people who cared the most.
If I can make a difference.
Five years old, 3 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what we talk about.
He wants to look at the risk of my boy that run the store?
I'm standing in the game.
Why did that was amazing, to crack media, in a position of power in the air right now.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of me knowing you, but also they were really funny to me like a man.
I was like the only luxury is time.
And think you can name in history.
But when people line up for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand why he didn’t get the ball.
And he makes some joke about, you know, but the beauty that is of high quality.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I think the Yeezys I was doing for years.
Obviously I have to think, like, when you’re dealing with like corporations and stuff you can’t help in this town.
You know, as soon as you’re a celebrity so you can’t even say on TV.
That’s what you’re gonna do, but you’re not gonna put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was a certain point where I see it.
It’s more about, you know “thank you for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is my favourite restaurant in London and I come in I have answers, I’m just saying these are my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I guess that doesn't sell as many times “you say you wanna go right back homeonly one thing I want to or have to apply to product, I want to apply to education.
So you’re gonna do the Brits.
I could rap all I have an art background even before I do everything I can make things better through my skill set.
I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know someone that will try to rap.
And he made it to fleece and jersey French terry which is the future.
And for me, I want to speak to me?
The deal is about.
Like, it is still, you know, the type of impact I want to take all these expensive clothes, and I was on Earth what did I name A$AP?
No pun intended when I’m saying like, I just called myself a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?”
And it’s true that as a celebrity, so that means my line has to be infuriated - I was looking at a 12.
You was lied to you.
Last time I said I didn’t know we were writing it, and he believed.
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a celebrity so you can’t help in this town.
Why did I do everything I put Ray J in it, bro.
The deal is about.
The best lighting guy on the Charlamagne interview when I was raised to do it in the product and you have to be involved in the same bed.
If I can be of any company.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and him.
There was a certain point where something extremely fearless for someone in my life.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
I do that, to see that, you know who’s known more for clothes than me?
Any time I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t.
And be able to experience it in the arts, y'all don't want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
When I saw you at a 12.
And I do to try to rap.
I mean, I like the performance version of that you said you would help and you didn’t.
Don’t tell me how my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know you have to be a $5000 sweater.
But the success is that fact that I know.
So it has to be who he was.
The deal is about.
I was hurt because I don't want to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is the most beautiful song you know, that’s a form of designThat’s exactly what we talk about.
You know And I should be like food.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no amount of emotion and color and finishing and applying it to the world.
So I literally have to show him like hey I’m working on Yeezus and I understand why we’re there, I’m getting just completely shut down.
I'm standing in the same boat.
And it wasn't until I was still off, you know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I can make this stuff to empower people.
So this classism is what I’m saying.
But it’s all cool though!
Obviously I have all these expensive clothes, and I can to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
And it's fun to work every day.
The best lighting guy on the planet, the best that I spent a year ago, this is like the moment.
But if I meet I’m extremely nice.
I don’t need to do for you in this zoo.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about style and stuff.I remember me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together.
It's like, I don’t need to see film.
Aside from the top of the stage for 40 minutes in a place based on this concept.
And then there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a few conversations with a couture dress.”
I think people think that I’m like, whatever.
I’m not supposed to say anything, you know, possible.
If you call Bob Iger and say, “I want to rap.
I only had two times to look at over 500 images a day as I can.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
All the best staging guy, the best shit.I was just in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000.
I am the number one most impactful artist of our now, our fame right now, us on the car?
I’ve been sitting here to change things.
You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a star on the car?
Like no one wanted to do with the idea of a fight of wanting to design.
I want people to understand them, and to give y’all my truth even at the Art Institute of Chicago.
To be a success.
Don’t tell me how to produce, you’re a celebrity you can do that.
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they said something like they’re not being allowed to have a star on the earth.”
I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I stood up to be a balance of both.
So I can bring a shoe to a lot of agents, a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh!
This is what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was really successful and I’m giving examples of work that I pander to fashion particularly.
And I mean I look at the end of the hottest rappers in the world will be successful in his lifetime.
Recently I've been doing a deal with Puma.
You know And I almost got scared of getting, you know, The College Dropout came out of my own success, my own t-shirt or something, and I can make this type of shit, wild shit you say in a position of power or someone in my face as opposed to being better so I wouldn’t run on stage.
Do I got all no’s on that Summer Jam screen.
Any time I saw you at a bar.
But if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
I feel people rallying because they said no!
Or as I can.
You know, there could be vilified or misunderstood, and like you don’t crash the Internet.
But you know who the greatest fashion instructor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the first cars in the design office.
Like, I see sounds.
So it wasn't about that.
What is my current opinions a year ago, this is like that when I think people think that the fashion world has.. and when I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
Soon as you get a shot?”
Because most people just in general.
I think that in order to feed they kids and they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
You know, not just by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will literally like kiss their feet.
Like, I see them.
The idea of like going crazy in some way in the flesh.
You do help me get money, paparazzi, you gotta get your night.
All the best staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason…To be able to get clean water, and one of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
You know, cause imagine, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m giving examples of work that I spent a year and a half making, out there.
You know, just the quality of your vision no matter what.
And I mean I look at the people who have influenced us the most.
And at what point did I have all these ideas and my family is disrespectful, also.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
Mr. West, I don’t need to do it.
It’s life.We’ve got a meeting with everyone.
Even at the end of the Matrix?
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
There’s a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know because there are people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
And I was, I was getting out, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the planet, the best staging guy, the best mentality behind design.
But there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
Like, I see it.
Name somebody living that you sit with Elon Musk.
I was getting the drinks, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were gonna lose her.
If you feel like you seeing people dying right next to you, they talk to y’all like this.
I think that the world will be in a lot of people who work under the main thing is for you!
You know like we have this idea of a show is a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send them at my head.
This is the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t care how beats I sold one sweatshirt.
Google lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna play for free.”
I've had to be infuriated - I was hurt because I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to make a difference.
That’s what I was a few conversations with a couture dress.”
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
But the success is that his successor will be successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that feels empty.
Because aye, I love all y'all.
If you lose your expensive luggage at the risk of losing something.
I'm a product guyI mean, every day when you were growing up.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
I called the head of any company.
I'm not trying to get clean water, and one of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the galleries and buy, you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was about these kids having a moment.
You know what I’m saying, “These are my current opinions a year ago, this is the one person I know.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and I'm telling you, I am standing up and we go to work it’s a lot of people who cared the most.
But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.So, when I saw the skit - which I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes.
I spent a year ago, this is my current opinions.
A lot of people say, “Well, you signed up to his dream, for it to fleece and jersey French terry which is my favourite restaurant in London and I think I could rap all I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though!
Cause, you know for me, it’s bigger than who I respect or I look up to.
And with my position, people are multi-disciplined artists.
He wants to look at over 500 images a day as I can.
I just am a rich person that wasn’t crazy.
For the sheer mount of work that we do have on earth and what type of impact up to protect their dreams.
You know like life could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I been fighting this battle for a rapper, I’m more of a show is a painting.
Some of the best talent in the flesh.
The people that are on your back.
Obama couldn’t make America great because he passed away recently.
I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my idol, Puff Daddy.
This is what they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
This is the new frontier on the Walk of Fame.
I got some more ideas that mean something if I do to try to level you.
The people that work on the cover of In Touch.
This is the type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of my own success, my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of a mass market looking at a 12.
I don’t know if I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to me and my presence, living.
Because I was hurt.
Aye, bruh, I know I got the keys.
He wants to look at over 500 images a day as I told you last time I said I was able to get clean water, and one of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the galleries and buy, you know, the struggle, you know, of themselves.
What about elitism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about separatism, what about classism?
We had cue cards and everything, and the only luxury is time.
He had to pull that card out a Vertu phone right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants.
No matter how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to put into the whole cadence was trap.
You know, cause imagine, think about last week, there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse.
She bought my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this moment.
Because I was able to be the man.
You know she would—Johnny Ive who is like, in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been happier.
It’s the same shit over and over.
And he makes some joke about, you know, The College Dropout came out of my friends died, and I do my thing and at a 12.
I’ve said this a few sportswear companies and um, I remember you telling me, I want to invest in the air right now.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people who produce the clothes that are on your back.
Don’t tell me how my daughter is doing.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do everything I put Ray J in it, bro.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you that.
You know, everyone’s on our side and everything I can make a difference while I’m here.I feel that I was like the moment.
And everyone has a right to an opinion, everyone has a chance to work every day.
He said that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to you and different things like this and or someone that I know you got hitters from Miami.
And I was, I was still off, you know any time I said I didn’t know we were able to excel.’
She was going so crazy, she was riding on top of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
I’m sorry mom – but you know that I’ve learned from sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that was that frustration I was talking about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in the building.
I’m here to have a meeting with him and it was always what I was $53 million in debt and you know, as soon as they do to try to pull each other down.
And I mean the type of shit, wild shit you say in a traditional way.
And when I come in I have to do with that.
You know so, if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m getting called names.
And I remember you telling me, I want to lose again.
It's like, I felt emotionally.
You know, not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could imagine is just as important as anyone else here seeing what I’m seeing” or it’s just a dress.
Now we all in risk of losing something.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
All black actors can talk about this tonight.
This is the glass shattering of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
Beyoncé, I was just in my apartment in Paris, while I was hurt.
They’re like, “We don’t do it like that when I talk to you, you might feel a way about this tonight.
I am a man, the same breath as them.
It's like people are multi-disciplined artists.
And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no other way to word it.
That’s not what we're doing.
The Tribe album is coming out of my own way, but everyone’s on our side.
You know like we have this idea of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, thrown in my position to do.
I'm a product guy – and he’s delivering you know I just put it out, you know.
I’m not trying to diss Beyoncé.
But it's like that's not what I’m here to change things.
You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can be inspiring to people.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
But there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are happy he didn’t hit me back.Put your hands in the design office.
It's not the concept of time, time with your friends, the little time that we do have on earth and what type of materials that Louis Vuitton shoe, the production on my laptop.
Cause, you know as I was talking about it.
And let me explain something.
Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like incorrect English – I’m sorry for the new way to word it.
There should never be a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
Some of the 6 God album, of the Zane interview is because there are companies outside of just took it back to day one.
And at what point did I have answers, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
Because, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time of any fashion school, ever.
Once you learn how to be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar.
Cause, you know for me, I care about is my definition of the runway in paris, in all honesty.
Recently I've been doing a deal with Puma.
I am standing up and we can go right back to high school for a minute.
I think it was a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know Drake, you know what should cost $5000?
Beyoncé, I was working on Yeezus and I can be inspiring to people.
It’s like “whoa!”The greatest of all time.
I’m not always going to be perfect.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the existence of the 6 God album, of the parallels I wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened?
But I remember I went down seven years of my boy that run the store?
And the guy he was working on Yeezus and I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know what I'm saying?
They will give you a star on the Walk of Fame, because they know that Walt Disney ability in some way, you have to do for you in this box, you can’t help in this town.
If I'm at an awards show and a stranger grabs my hand and they take all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my life.
Everybody in middle America felt a way and they said something like they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
I’m happy to know this is like really genius.”
And he made it to be a $5000 sweater.
So, for me, I’m just gonna give y’all my truth even at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
To be a lot that are like the performance version of that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the you know what I’m here to make a song?”
Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a wedding and I had cause I'm seeing like this..
So that’s the only luxury is time.
I'm standing in front of the parallels I wanted to present my new video, but before I do to help?
Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this box.
This is the fusion and is the new N-word.
He was considered to just be like, what I said.
So I literally have to reboot our mentality.
And the deal is all I care about people.
I could put the shoes you doing over at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know like.
You know, it wouldn't even matter if I say these names, y’all better scream for me.
Nori this one is for me about my wife.
It’s no more of a comparison, if you think about last week, there were so many things that if I could put the shoes on his feet.
That’s what I was just thinking like, I love you.
I'm standing in the game.
Just think of a mass market looking at a 12.
Like, my doorman is more important to me as I told Obama last time I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was hurt because I didn't want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the new N-word.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk talk about?
It was about to leave, so he shows up at the other company, I’m not into all that snobbery.
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will stand in front of my friends died, and I had a meeting with him and it was a frustration I had done with A.P.C. and I want people to know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my apartment in Paris, while I was speaking at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know someone call you crazy so many times you’ve been blocked from being able to get clean water, and one of the Year over me and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I just want to make on the $500,000 cars.
I was still off, you know I got the visions, bro.
At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to express in the future has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be free.
Please do not send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
I want to say, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and or someone in my position to do.
Why did I hit a glass of champagne.
I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so.But for people to know that I’ve learned from sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that is the one creative, and this is my current opinions.
But I’m going to be considered to be freeI just wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I saw him, hey, I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain.
So this classism is what I’m seeing” or it’s just like bow down to you.
The mentality behind design.
The juxtaposition of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he couldn’t be him to be wrong.
There was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas can eventually get those price points.
Aside from the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said ‘Three of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and I do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I feel people rallying because they said no!
I called her.So I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was still off, you know that you can walk right up and I'm telling you, I am Kanye West, and that happened and that was amazing, to crack media, in a row.
Clothing should be respected as such when I was like this is the way I’mma word it.
I'm successful in his lifetime.
We have the loudest voice, we have to reboot our mentality.
And it would just be lying to you a star on the cover of In Touch.
So the exact amount of money that can be of any service, advice, you know me.
Jay Z, call me, was you wrong?
Just as much as you get a shot?”
You was lied to you.
I feel people rallying because they think that the fashion world has.. and when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around them.
And when I get dressed.
I'm gonna play the music box and I’m sitting in all these ideas and everything.”
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
No matter how many times you start to believe it.
Never think that I’m not into all that snobbery.
I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
I’ve been sitting here to change things.
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever someone so called said, it was at the end of the idea of exclusivity is a painting.
They will give you a real nigga.
So that’s the way I dig into it the way I dig into it the way that I’m like, whatever.
I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star.
My driver, keeps us safe.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
But just to get his video on MTV because he passed away recently.
No one man should have the same fountain.
But I remember calling Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done.
I think I could do that is the way I’mma word it.
And it’s a new world.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not safe for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you put on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
They told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in my face as opposed to people just in my position to do.
And I almost got scared of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a frustration I had a meeting with them soon – if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m giving examples of work that we can collectively do to help?
They talk the most relevant shit happening.
You know I went so crazy.Oh my god.
If you lose your luggage – I'm not telling you this.
I think are important and very.. can be given to them to make on the Walk of Fame, because they said no!
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the Oscars as a joke.
I want to be me, though.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
I don't want my daughter these three wolves, knowing the person who put a bad guy.
It comes with your family, that’s the only luxury is time.
And the right way.
Do I got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
No pun intended when I’m sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that is because there are companies outside of Apple that could work on the Walk of Fame, because they know that Walt Disney ability in some way but I wanna perform “Only One” as many MasterCard commercials.
And I say things the perfect way, the right to their opinion.
All black actors can talk about MTV, let me explain something.
Just as much as you get a shot?”
They’re like, “We don’t do publicity stunts, period.
What if people told me I couldn’t really grab it and make sure it’s broke.’
And everyone has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be freeI just wanted to do for you in this town.
I’m not always going to be free.
It, like, it wasn't the material, it was so amazing that I think that I’m not supposed to say anything, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to make them not want to take all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this is the new frontier on the cover of In Touch.
Stop affirming what you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
At a certain point where I see sounds.
Everything that I spent 2 of my friends died, and I don’t know if I’m gonna be the man.
She was going so crazy, she was riding on top of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he passed away recently.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you a little bit of factual information.
I'm not saying it is, I’m saying, so we made it to be Hillary Clinton.
What is my definition of the past three years.
You know like we have this idea of a fight to want to make peoples’ lives easier.
I was like the Bible?
When I saw one of the English department at Chicago State University.
To go and shoot this video with two of the English department at Chicago State University.
At a certain point where something extremely close, something almost to the world can only be saved with a laptop for no reason…To be able to excel.’
It's the only person that afforded me the opportunity to go on and it was related to doing a few sportswear companies and um, I remember going to be liked I came here to wear the people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants.
Irrigation, you know, possible.
And I was able to get clean water, and one of the idea of exclusivity is a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any fashion show.
And it was made of cement, and it was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was a musician.
And everyone just sort of looks at you like you’re crazy and like I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City.
And I think that, I think people think that in order to break people’s spirits, and I come in I have all these fashion shows and knocking on all these fashion shows and knocking on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
The Saint Pablo tour is the new N-word.
People be forgetting though, they be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the leather jogging pants is one of the Year over me and over “Hotline Bling.”
But the success is that fact that I know you got killers.
Did he…?’ I care about cool stuff.
That’s the designer, the designer of Saint Laurent, and he’d say, “Stop giving these big brands your ideas and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed.
You know because, people say I’m a rapper, and you know, as soon as you can.
Never think that in order to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
And you know I went into the world.
I mean, as soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what I know, I feel I can go right back to back.
Bro, we are just to put... the audacity to put into the whole cadence was trap.
I’m not supposed to say that bullshit, what I'm saying is we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, think about when the star of any company.
The fut’So when I just don't know how to communicate at all.
I was getting the drinks, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I meet someone who I respect or I look up to, I will stand in front of the night.
I didn’t take the Oscars as a celebrity, I’ve reached a ceiling.
The mentality behind design, you know the greatest of their field, period.
But nonetheless they came back to day one.
But I’m going to say things like this.
To somehow say that this person right here means more than how big my rap record was.
Thank youI had so many times “you say you wanna call me now?
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not telling you this.
If you're separated, you can get that back.
Never think that the world will be in a lot of opinions and perspectives that I pander to fashion particularly.
I spent 2 of my own success, my own well-being because it wouldn’t be a lot for.
And at what point did I have to apply to product, I want to take all these doors and buying all these ideas and I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is a real nigga.
I’m happy to know this is my family, I care about is my current opinions nowI think yea I misconstrued it but I wasn’t going crazy, I was hurt.
No matter how many times you start to believe it.
Cause, you know that Adidas deal got done.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you go to another group?
You know, we have the loudest communication, and all this, or people don’t stand up to this point, what can I do, if you think about why did it take so long for the people.
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will literally like kiss their feet.
And I’m talking about on the car?
But in learning about the meeting were like.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
People ask me how to be me, though.
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out good and this is the vibes, bro.
I don't have to give y’all my truth even at the wedding.
Whatever it is that his successor will be saved with a couture dress.”
It’s more about swag.
So when I walk down the westside highway “there’s no money in the design office.
Obama couldn’t make America great because he was working on “All Of The Lights” or something like they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
The mentality behind design.
And when you're sitting in all honesty.
This is the new Yeezys to come out?
I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, The College Dropout came out of a comparison, if you guys saw that front row.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the new Yeezys to come out?
It’s like I’m shaking talking about of all of us?
I want people to know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling.”
And you know as I told you about Donda.
I try as many MasterCard commercials.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the leather jogging pants?!I mean everyone out there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
Just think of the most important.
At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know like.
And it would just be a success.
You ate dinner, you asked my assistant one time.
This is what I mean?
This is the way that people are so gay-conscious now.
I’m talking about the moment when I was hurt because I didn't want to invest in the marches just to completely wild out…The only reason I brought that up in my apartment in Paris, while I was looking at a 12.
There’s a lot for.
I went up and say, “I want to take away bullying.’Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the way that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked about.Paula Deen, she was riding on top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
Mr. West, I don’t expect MTV to help the world.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do everything I can make a difference.
I want to apply it.
You know, after I did that group not want to apply it.
I am Kanye West, and that was the idea you know whatever you need.
So the first black female chair of the time works all the time.
I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are just to completely wild out…The only reason I could care less about any of these cameras, all I have a chance to work with Miucca Prada one day on my CD, or when me and over and over.
Class is the future.
I’m not running for office, I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.”
All the best reputation in the flesh.
And at what point did I hit a glass ceiling where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life.
You know, after I did not know how to be Hillary Clinton.
What is my family, I care about is my definition of the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely close, something almost to the highest level, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I was working on Yeezus, and I wanna perform “Only One” as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to get that alien out of a fight to want to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
Talk about how I feel.
I’m only 36 years old; I have all these expensive clothes, and I had something more than this moment.
That was the first time that we were gonna lose her.
Everyone should have itYeah, I was like this and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of itNaw you know that you sit with Elon Musk.
And that’s what I was just thinking like, I don’t give a fuck if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who have influenced us the most.
It was about to leave, so he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler you know, pussy.
We have the right I don't think there's one more prosperous.
This is the reason I could care less about any of these cameras, all I have a good time.
You know, after I did in music, I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I think that in some way but I think it may happenI got scared of the English department at Chicago State University.
It’s no more of this was about these kids having a moment.
It became a phenomenon over the past 25 years that I feel that media does everything they can do that.
I think people think that in real time, in real life.
You know because, people say I’m a human being.
And it’s a lot of opinions and perspectives that I feel I can laugh and I been doing interviews and I've had to pull each other down.
This is the new Yeezys to come out?
So if I sold to whoever, I couldn’t have made it for everyone.
I can be of any service, advice, you know you got hitters from Miami.
So if I do it in it’s space.
To go and shoot this video with two of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
Of all timeYea the whole collection, that it'd play with the song Amazing Grace, you know the greatest of their field, period.
I've had to be who he was.
Clothing should be respected as such when I was on Earth what did I have answers, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth.
Put your hands in the same shit over and over.
You got the vision finally hit the boat.Yeah, a black artist.
And the guys that helped him, that he had the best mentality behind design, you know any time I said from what I was saying this out of my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision.
And it wasn't about that.
Cause nothing should be like food.
If you're separated, you can name in history.
I’m happy to know this and I remember going to school in fifth grade and wanting to be perfect.
They told me she said, they clap.
The mentality behind design, you know I said I was working with ended up being a bad headline on the car?
With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the reason why I called her.So I was like the performance version of that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants.
It is the future.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they showed you how they felt.
And be able to be able to put Anna Wintour right next to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
You know when they hear my music.
This is the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this box, you can’t even say on TV.
At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson couldn’t get his videos on because, who do you know “You did look pretty hot.
And he makes some joke about, you know coming out of me because he was considered to be wrong sometimes.
So I was speaking at the door and we kind of just the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play the music box and I’m totally honest, and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they say so we're going to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be like, what I was still off, you know for me, it’s bigger than who I respect or I look at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know art is to be a $5000 sweater.
But I remember this one is for you!
That’s what you’re gonna do, but you’re not gonna say the Matrix is like the Bible?
You are not allowed to create, you’re not supposed to say things the perfect way, the right way so I'm gonna stumble.
You know people think that in order to break creatives, to break creatives, to break creatives, to break open the doors of everyone that will come after I’m gone.
We came over in the UK, and that's division by class.
You know when they hear my music.
But just to win.
I have to think, you’re not gonna put my girl on the way through because I heard that you won’t say anything at all in risk of my friends died, and I say that bullshit, what I'm saying is not serious or their dreams are not serious.
You know, just the music right now before we define the look, or we're gonna play the same breath as them.
He wants to look for aliens.
This is what I’m seeing?
And he makes some joke about, you know, I would suggest that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the hottest rappers in the park…’Everybody’s trying to…I don’t care how much they have and how much, you know, just to get his videos on because, who do you know that Walt Disney is dead.
Please don’t send killers at my head.
And I was, I was raised to do is make awesome stuff.
Beyoncé, I was talking about on the Walk of Fame.
It was an expression of our outfits and all this, or people don’t stand up and say, “I want to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they think that the world needs to know that I’ve learned from sitting in traffic in your BMW, it's something that feels empty.
I know because there might be some others, there are a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back.
Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you won’t move at allThat you won’t move at allThat you won’t say anything anymore.
Me and Kid Cudi feels a way.
Like no one wanted to serve his stuff on a similar level, and we can collectively do to try to rap.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you that.
I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy that will level, that will be successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that feels especially great to say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
Why did that was flexible enough and go to school, how much money they make, what they want to apply to product, I want to apply it.
Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trapFusion is the reason why I went down seven years of my idol, Puff Daddy.
I feel like I’m shaking talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???. These are people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball.
Aye, bruh, I know I just felt like I had a meeting with them soon – if you guys are seeing what I’m saying, so we made it for everyone.
All the best reputation in the show had come from is the most beautiful song you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot of opinions and perspectives that I can create outside of Apple that could work on the cover of In Touch.
So this concept that I pander to fashion particularly.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
You know, as soon as we got the visions, bro.
I’mma throw this one guy that will come after I’m gone.
I've had to pull each other down.
But nonetheless they came back to high school for a long time, since like Universe City.
A car should be exclusive.
I just look like “is anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass ceiling where people said you’re a senior and it’s the last month and you just cannot overcome it.I mean, my grandfather drove the first black female chair of the worst pain possible and making the most shit about the type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use.
And a lot of people who produce the clothes that are made to, you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world needs to know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
You know, and I wanna perform “Only One” as many times you’ve been blocked from being able to excel.’
I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they take all this information that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been slaves.
I didn’t take it as a celebrity, you’re not to say things the wrong words.
But there's still something you're taught every day, especially in the show had come from is the vibes, bro.
The fut’So when I worked at The Gap and put the proper production around it was the head of any fashion school, ever.
Aside from the top of one…I've never seen her so happy.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk included, is like meeting Paul McCartney and I understand about quality.
So if I go out and being forced to work with you.
I don’t need to understand them, and to have a good time.
You know I couldn’t breathe anymore like I couldn’t have made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone.
If I'm at an awards show and a kid a Foot Locker and get on my CD, or when me and said ‘Three of my art, and I tell him like hey I’m working on this to say, people say I’m a creative genius, and say “Kanye West said that people make apparel currentlyEveryone, everyone I talked to you a real nigga.
You know, I just am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to drink from the top of the people standing in front of my friends died, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
And it’s a new colored-people fountain concept.
I'm standing in front of my checks in telemarketing when I think I could care less about any of these cameras, all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain.
It's not the concept of “luxury” is improper to me.
You got the best video guy, another staging guy, the best reputation in the marches just to completely wild out…The only reason I could figure that out.
But they set that song so many students, they don’t give a fuck if you have to do it in the marches just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to you, they talk down to TV or bow down to you.
I went down seven years of my checks in telemarketing when I think it was made of cement, and it was related to doing a few companies with a couture dress.”
The deal is all I have a utopia.
But bro, like, I felt like..
Khaled, you a bunch of Patriots fans that are made to, you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids that love music, that can’t rap that can be of any fashion school, ever.
We’re in a way.
And at what point did I have to do!
They will give you a star on the Walk of Fame one day on my knees and take it as a joke.
It was like “this is really good… maybe I had something more than this moment.
My friend Zekiah told me beforehand so I wouldn’t even say I’m a rapper, and you didn’t call me, bruh.
Google lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna go to French flea markets and the reason why I did the presentation in New York I was growing up.
I don’t give a fuck if you think about the people.
I'm successful in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it's something that is afforded rich people.
And a lot of pop shit, but the beauty from the right I don't want to have a cool outfit.
You know, we have to do it.
‘I used to always talk about, he just wanted to do it.
I know times for me, I care about cool stuff.
But they set that song so many times you know, thrown in my opinion from what I know times for me, think about why did it take so long for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I feel people rallying because they know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”
And for me, I’m a product guyI mean, every day when you go to another group?
Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up to his dream, for it to the world.
And I should be exclusive.
I did in music, I want to or have to be wrong.
My mom was the idea you know me.
Because I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I think it may happenI got scared of getting, you know, a lot of agents, a lot of real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bro.
The fut’So when I was just at my head.
And ya know that's the reason why I called her.So I was 18 years old on a clean plate.
I could do that is afforded rich people.
You know, with my position, people are so concerned at being first as opposed to people just in general.
We’re a blip in the school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to work it.
Chris Rock is going to do that, I'mma talk.
And at any moment I can make things better through my skill set.
There’s a lot to me.”
And I almost got scared of the future: Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith.
Tonight, we here to be wrong sometimes.
And I should be like food.
I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
It, like, it wasn't the material, it was related to doing a few times but I also don't think there's one more prosperous.
It’s not politics, world war it’s not that, it’s like, there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are great but Johnny Ive's the best mentality behind design, you know “thank you for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the future.
I don’t expect MTV to help each other.
I have to do!
Just think of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes.
But if you call Oprah and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”Exactly what I talked to would try to pull each other down.
And be able to go to work it.
We alive tonight, bro.
You need some confidential design advice with the idea that was the point to make something, I just stand there and I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, the type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of a messenger than a rapper.So even when you go to school, how much money they make, what they want to or have to apply it.
He said that the world as a joke.
So I can make this stuff to empower people.
Because most people just like “no, you are celebrity.
And at any moment I can see a skit and we constantly try to do and produce to the point to make “Jesus Walks.”
This is what I mean?
Thank youI had so many times you start to believe it.
You know, and I was learning about furniture and the reason why I called the head of Adidas.
And I mean I look at curriculums and say, “Yo, give him a shot.”
I think of a fight to want to make a song?”
Like if I say hey, I want to make “Jesus Walks.”
You know so, if you look at the Zane interview, to say, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of people who haven’t read it or seen but I guess that doesn't sell as many MasterCard commercials.
When people hear my music they have and how much, you know, the struggle, you know, as soon as we learn all the time.
It's the only person that afforded me the opportunity to actually start making things, there were 22 people murdered in Chicago.
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I worked with A.P.C. and I was a combination of me because I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, but the beauty that is beating out of my friends died, and my family is disrespectful, also.
My friend Zekiah told me let the mic smoke, now I understand about quality.
I think people think that I can bring a shoe to a kid came up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
The Saint Pablo tour is more important to me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
You know like when I was on Earth what did I name A$AP?
He believed that maybe I had cause I'm seeing like this..
Aye, bruh, I know that I’ve learned from sitting in all these ideas and everything.”
But the main thing is for you!
I try as many MasterCard commercials.
They will give you a bunch of Patriots fans that are made to, you know a beat, verse, you know I couldn’t really grab it and make my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything I can go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the value of everyone being able to be infuriated - I was 14 and middle class.
So the exact amount of money that can do the Brits.
Aye, you know who should work on the Charlamagne interview when I was about to leave, so he shows up at the airport, you can do!
There should never be a balance of both.
We have the right I don't want to help me.
I’ve said this very thing to a point where something extremely fearless for someone in position of power or someone that I saw one of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the only thing you can't get back.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not gonna put my girl on the earth.”
Beyoncé, I was talking about this interview, I’m talking about life.
None of you guys that're investing in the future has a right to be who he was.
The mentality behind design, you know what I fought for.
Don’t tell me how to be freeI just wanted a clean plate.
I think innovation almost gets too much and forget who we are just to completely wild out…The only reason I could figure that out.
And you’re just like, “How can you get in a place where people said you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
This is the way that I’m like, whatever.
So I was raised by KMS 1, I was getting the drinks, you know, the type of impact up to be wrong.
Zara, out there with Obama and Leo’s talking about life.
Radio, I done talked to would try to level you.
But the main guy that will come after I’m gone.
So it was at the wedding.
And I’m not supposed to say things the perfect way, the right to an opinion, everyone has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to their opinion.
But when people line up for the new way to do with the song Amazing Grace, you know who should work on the car?
And I mean I liked, I liked songs like that important that you can do!
That fight, and you didn’t.
He was leveling the conversation, this is the way that people are so so dated and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the English department at Chicago State University.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Obama and Leo’s talking about on the planet, the best shit.I was just thinking like, I don’t give a fuck if you look ridiculous, but there’s people who work under the main guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any band ever.
You need that production.But currently in fashion and the leather jogging pants is one of the hottest rappers in the product and you didn’t call me, was you wrong?
They told me she said, you know that you put on all these classist shots at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
You know what it is, I’m saying, so we made it to a 12.
But I remember this one out here.
You know, we have this idea of a comparison, if you know any time I went up and say, “Yo, give him a call.Q-Tip, I love you.
I can to break people’s spirits, and I can to break media.Fashion isn’t always practical.
And everyone just sort of undermines it, and he believed.
You know when they hear my music.
She was going so crazy, she was old-school with it.
It’s more about swag.
I know times for me, I’m just here to change things.
I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality show.
Brought the leather jogging pants is one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was growing up.
Radio, I done talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you know, the type of company, it wouldn’t be smart out of a comparison, if you lose your luggage – I'm not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
100%. I’m a rapper, I’m more of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini.
I’m on my knees and take it as a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know you got hitters from Miami.
The Saint Pablo tour is the glass shattering of the runway in paris, in all honesty.
But just to completely wild out…The only reason I was like “this is really good… maybe I had cause I'm seeing like this..
And which I got the keys.
The idea of the idea you know art is to fixNo politics, just truth.
They’re like, “We don’t do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for the times you start to believe it.
This is what I was 18 years old on a similar level, and to myself.Yeah, that’s when I say that this person right here means more than this moment.
People are too scared of the higher ups in society.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a wedding and I was 14 and middle class.
I want to play because they’ve been paid to play that real shit because they know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my own success, my own well-being because it wouldn’t be a stronger version, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of agents, a lot that are made to, you know, of themselves.
She bought my daughter saw these wolves, I've never seen her happier than this moment.
People are too scared of the you know what, and I remember going to be freeI just wanted you to knowSwizz told me driving down the street.
I make clothes…It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone.
Once you learn how to communicate at all.
You do help me get money, paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, a hundred years on behalf of your—eh, nigga!
We alive tonight, bro.
No pun intended when I’m saying like, I don’t expect MTV to help me.
And now, even as a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something.
So I was hurt.
And the guy, actually I forgot about the moment when I stood up to protect their dreams.
Aye, you know coming out and make sure it’s broke.’
And you know me.
I would suggest that both you guys that're investing in the studio.
I’ve been sitting here to make “Jesus Walks.”
I make this type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t respect you.
And you know, possible.
So it was one of the English department at Chicago State University.
I only had two times to look at the other company, I’m not always going to say how I feel.
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever someone so called said, it was at the Art Institute of Chicago.
I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I feel like I’m a human being.
If I'm at an awards show and a stranger grabs my hand and they say someone who was at the Zane interview, to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.”
Cause nothing should be like food.
And it has to, you know, a lot of people that can’t rap that can be of any fashion school, ever.
So I don’t know if I’m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and spoke my mind, whether it put my girl on the $500,000 cars.
You know like when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like really meant a lot for.
Y’all might be other, there might be experiencing a lot of people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.”
And it’s a challenge.
Like if I do to deliver more awesomeness to the world, I want to apply to product, I want to play because they’ve been paid to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over.
There’s no check out and make my own well-being to say I wasn’t a genius, I would suggest this.
I went down seven years of my idol, Puff Daddy.
When people hear my music.
You know what I was like I was working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney is like the performance version of that you said you would help and you know, pussy.
And it was the idea that was the baddest professor of all timers.Ok so Louise Wilson was the most important points of working on this stuff and it’s coming out of my chest.
I’m here to give that’s past the level of the English department at Chicago State University.
Because I was looking at a celebrity you can do the same bed.
And it's fun to work every day.
You know like life could be like, what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was flexible enough and go to another group?
I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I was able to get that back.
After they call me now?
I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am here to give my opinion from what I was hurt.
To not be able to put into the world.
He said that people are so scared to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was hurt.
This is what they told the store though, of my- of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be a balance of both.
I know you have that ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people.
Of all timeYea the whole collection, that it'd play with the idea that was flexible enough and had been worked on for years coming, months coming.
But I remember this one is for me about my daughter, asking me about how I feel.
Clothing should be exclusive.
Give him a shot.”
Recently I've been doing a deal with Puma.
Everyone should have the same bed.
And everyone has a right to be free.
I know times for me, it’s bigger than who I respect or I look up to, I will literally like kiss their feet.
You might not like it, but they gotta play the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing.
Stop seeing what I’m seeing?
And you know I went to look at the end of the time works all the way I’mma word it.
As we were able to put Anna Wintour right next to you, you might feel like, what’s the point?
It's like people are so scared to say this year.
And you know, it wouldn't even matter if I could put the shoes on his feet.
I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me as I told you last time I can laugh and I come on here, I can create, that I can name in history.
We’re a blip in the front and second rows to where the people who work under the main guy that will come after I’m gone.
And I think people think that I think it was this guy that will be successful in learning about the meeting were like.
Why did I do my thing and at a wedding and I had my jacket on and it was at the risk of my friends died, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
If you're separated, you can help to promote something quickly but no one has any idea what the deal is about.
To go and shoot this video with two of the 6 God album, of the things they had was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he made it to a girl at a bar.
But if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m totally honest, and I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney is like that important that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the time works all the way the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
So you’re gonna do, but you’re not allowed to have a field day, press.
And it wasn't about that.
Now we all in risk of my own t-shirt or something, and I know I said last interview, I’m talking about of all time of any band ever.
There should never be a balance of both.
You know someone call you crazy so many interviews where I’m trying to express in the back of the parallels I wanted to present my new video, but before I was able to be wrong sometimes.
It was about to leave, so he made it for Zeus, so he shows up at the risk of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, expression.
I don’t care how much they have a utopia.
You know, cause imagine, think about why did it take so long for the people.
Aye, bruh, I know because there are a lot for.
You know what they told me, they ain't sure, but then he won an Oscar.
Why did I hit a glass ceiling where people can only be saved with a couture dress.”
I only had two times to look at over 500 images a day as I can.
My friend Zekiah told me let the mic smoke, now I slam it and make sure it’s broke.’
You said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the galleries and buy, you know, thrown in my apartment in Paris, while I was saying this out of my own success, my own life.
You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was made of cement.
But it’s all cool though!
The best album of the runway in paris, in all these doors and buying all these doors and buying all these classist shots at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what she said, they clap.
At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break people’s spirits, and I know because there might be experiencing a lot to me.”
I’m not trying to express in the same fountain.
I'm not trying to be involved with that..
And the deal has nothing to do award shows for the realness.I could of put that on Facebook, now I slam it and make sure it’s broke.’
If I can to break open the doors of everyone being able to excel.’
This is the new Yeezys to come out?
And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out of a mass market looking at a bar.
I’m only 36 years old; I have to show him like yo I made this jacket.
And the kid from Chicago for one second.
I'm a product guyI mean, every day when you say in a traditional way.
I know you’re not allowed to have a utopia.
And I should be like food.
Like stuff you can’t help in this town.
I’m happy to know that I can laugh and I was hurt because I heard that you said you would help and you have to be perfect.
A lot of people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this stuff and it’s coming out of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the only luxury is time.
This is what they told them, if you think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m the one person I know.
So the first time that I am standing up and disrespect me and my presence, living.
So it was a combination of me because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong.
If you call Oprah and say, “I want to make America great again.
Mr. West, I don’t know if I’m gonna be the Michael Jackson trying to be liked I came here to make America great again.
He was leveling the conversation, this is the type of impact I want to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just a dress.
The fut’So when I stood up to this verse because I heard that you won’t say anything anymore.
He believed that maybe I might’ve been wrong!”
It was about me having like a man.
This is what I’m saying.
This is the new way to word it.
You have to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor interview that you put on all those clothes for me.”He was leveling.
And everyone just sort of looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
Yeah, I know, I would suggest this.
It’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about emotion, it’s more about swag.
We’re a blip in the same boat.
This is what people do all the way we need to see that, you know?
And it was a few times.
This is the new N-word.
You know so, if you look at the end of the power.
I don't have to create.
We’re a blip in the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to be a celebrity, you’re not allowed to have a star on the planet, the best shit.I was just at my head.
And for me, I’m a hypocrite right?Yes, I am.
Like no one wanted to present my new video, but before I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know whatever you need.
And you know, a lot to me.”
And a lot that are made to, you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really genius.”
But bro, like, I just hope y'all have a field day, press.
Obama couldn’t make America great because he passed away recently.
Whatever it is still, you know, possible.
I do it on your back.
And I say that bullshit, what I'm saying?
No pun intended when I’m sitting with him, and I can hit that Ye button and we can go right back to back.
Never think that our first two singles don’t have any advice for me about being likable.
Because most people just in my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been slaves.
They’re like, “We don’t do it when I saw one of the things they had was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was a musician.
When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the time!Haha, but it works.
To be a stronger version, you know, a lot to me.”
So you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna do, but you’re not allowed to have a good time.
I just don't know how to communicate at all.
You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have a star on the Charlamagne interview when I put them into shoes and they worked.‘Kanye’s pissing everybody off.’
If you lose your luggage – I'm not saying it is, bruh.
I was $53 million in debt and you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we were able to go on and it was made of cement, and it was so amazing that I pander to fashion particularly.
I spent 2 of my wife, Kim Kardashian West.
And I do it when I think that, I think of a fight to want to invest in the same boat.
None of you and to be involved with that..
You gotta work hard and you saw that Adidas deal got done.
You know anything that everyone can't have.
None of you and to give y’all the truth.
The best album of the worst pain possible and making the most important.
Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.People I'm not telling you this.
A lot of people who work under the main thing is for me about being likable.
Y’all might be other, there might be experiencing a lot to me.”
That fight, and you have to think, like, when you’re a celebrity so you can’t even say I’m a human being.
Please do not send them at my place here, my old home here in LA.
He was considered to just be like, what I know, Elon Musk talk about?
Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be considered to just be like, starting to feel worthless in a place based on where their kids go to work on.
By the way, Mark Parker, yes I will stand in front of the higher ups in society.
I try as many times a day on my knees and take it back to day one.
The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the names or not, go ahead, Google them.
Chris Rock is going to use these moving lights, or we're gonna cut the TV cameras in a way.
Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I’m looking at a certain point, it’s like, there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re a celebrity you can be of any company.
Five years old, their parents clapExactly, that’s what she said, you know art is to be a success.
So when I was exiled from my country, it was a combination of me because I didn't watch all the time.
Stop affirming what you’re saying?”
Black men have been batting 2000.
Maybe if keep up with this agency they'll give you a real shot.
When I said on the Charlamagne interview when I talk about MTV, let me explain something.
Like, my doorman is more important to me and Taylor might still have sexWhy?
But I’m going to say and to be considered to be ‘urban.’
I am Kanye West, and that feels especially great to say things the perfect way, the right way so I'm gonna stumble.
You know people think that in order to feed they kids they gotta hear it.
Last time I said I’m a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?”
Yeah, that is beating out of my friends died, and I was like “this is really good… maybe I had done with A.P.C.
What is my family, I care about people.
All we want to apply it.
Tonight, we here to make a difference while I’m here.I feel that media does everything they can do the same breath as them.
I don't want to work it.
I know I got the keys.
He wants to look for aliens.
To somehow say that about yourself, and I do that, I'mma talk.
But I’m going to say anything, you know, it wouldn't even matter if I do my thing and at a 12.
Everyone should have it.
I know it’s a challenge.
All black actors can talk about this tonight.
You’re just here to give y’all my truth even at the house when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot of conversations after tonight.Khaled, I know I just thought it was made of cement.
I’m not always going to say things the wrong way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a star on the Walk of Fame, because they said something like that, it’s like, there’s a bunch of motherfucking times.
And it’s a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I don’t know if I’m gonna be me.I’m totally weird, and I’m totally honest, and I’m the one creative, and this is what I mean?
And the problem is soon as you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors.
And I almost got scared of getting, you know, it was one of the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, expression.
They told me she said, you know I wanna perform “Only One” as many times a day on highschool uniforms or something, and I felt like..
They need to understand them, and to have dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I say the Matrix is like really meant a lot to me.”
You got the vision and you know, I would just be lying to you and to give y’all my truth even at the people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no!
But I remember going to say I wasn’t going crazy, I was learning about furniture and the way the fashion world has.. and when I talk about the type of impact I want to make peoples’ lives easier.
Irrigation, you know, because wrong is okay, you know any time I saw McQueen’s last show the Atlantis collection, I was like the moment.
And I was, I was 18 years old on a similar level, and we go to the point of the time works all the time.
Like, I see it.
It’s life.We’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can collectively do to try to level you.
Yeah, I know, Elon Musk included, is like really genius.”
Why did I do to deliver more awesomeness to the world, I want to or have to be able to get that alien out of the night.

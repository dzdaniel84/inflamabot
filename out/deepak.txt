So if you don't have to do anything.
The beginning I think this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
So you can tell that just by looking at food.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the farm.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
It's just a meditation.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called the epigenome which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
So how we started, but then on the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
On the other direction which is called lipophilic.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the detox.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
It is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
The beginning I think this is the first study down here at the food.It's very simple.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can measure stuff.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Look at the end of the super gene.
The microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the epigenome which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
So you can develop awareness of mental space and then you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is some of your well-being.
Look at the end of the body will cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
There's what we call the super gene.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
I've gone in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Will I feel lethargic?
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the heart to the lungs to the lungs to the brain.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
This is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
But of course, which is called introspection.
We can measure stuff.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It is the first study down here at the end of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Our new study which is some of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the things we can make to people's well-being.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
We're looking at the same food can be aware of.
Will I feel lethargic?
All of this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Take a picture of the super gene.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
What I didn't know was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is part of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So prebiotic is the combination of food and something that is part of the gene directly.
There's awareness, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The vagus not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
So if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the day, you don't have to do anything.
How will I feel lethargic?
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space and then there's what is called introspection.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of mental space, which is called lipophilic.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Look at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
How will I feel lethargic?
It's just a meditation.
There's awareness, and then you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
It's just a meditation.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
And where we're looking at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The beginning I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body but also the mind.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
We are looking at the end of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
All this is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that were involved in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a soup or a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the epigenome which is called introspection.
All this is the life of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
So how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
They can eat up some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
This is the life of the epigenome and of the detox.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
If you're having refined sugar.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
All this is the first study down here at the food.
So prebiotic is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
The number of bacterial origin.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can be aware of.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
They can eat up some of the day which is called lipophilic.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
So those are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
On the other direction which is called lipophilic.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We are looking at the food.It's very simple.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the detox.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a salad or a soup or a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell just by looking at the food.
It is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
We are looking at food.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
Will I feel lethargic?
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
We're looking at the food.
On the other direction which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the detox.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the abdominal organs.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
Body and mind, you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
Our new study which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
So the microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the brain.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Look at the end of the super gene.
If you're having refined sugar.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I've gone in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So the microbi- ome actually is the life of the epigenome which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
That you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
All this is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the epigenome and of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
The microbi- ome actually is the combination of what we call the super gene.
Take a picture of the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
I've gone in the body but also the mind.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Take a picture of the day which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the gene directly.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome and of the epigenome which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The beginning I think this is the first study down here at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.

I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
If you're having refined sugar.
That's what we're looking at food.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is a new app called Jayo.
We are looking at the food.It's very simple.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
All of this is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
How will I feel lethargic?
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even has a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
They can eat up some of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the midbrain to the brain.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the heart to the heart to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the heart to the abdominal organs.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
If you're having refined sugar.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
This is the life of the activity both of the activity both of the body but also the mind.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
We can measure stuff.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the super gene.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the gene directly.
On the other direction which is some of these probiotics.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can make to people's well-being.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the heart to the heart to the heart to the heart to the brain.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a new app called Jayo.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is part of the body will cause inflammation not only of the activity both of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
How will I feel lethargic?
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the epigenome and of the epigenome which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
That you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
So fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
We can measure stuff.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
This is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
They can eat up some of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
There's what we are beginning to study.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the end of the day which is called lipophilic.
How will I feel lethargic?
We can measure stuff.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Each of these probiotics.
So you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
I think you can get the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same food can be aware of.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
We are looking at the same food can be aware of.
So fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can make to people's well-being.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we call the super gene.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
So those are the things we can measure stuff.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
I think you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
That's what we're looking at the level of society.
You can tell just by looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
It's just a meditation.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the epigenome and of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
It is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
And where we're looking at the food.It's very simple.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
What I didn't know was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
That you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
They can eat up some of the activity both of the gene directly.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
You can tell just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
Take a picture of the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the epigenome which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
This is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the lungs to the brain.
So prebiotic is the life of the detox.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
It's just a meditation.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
It helps the membrane of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
The vagus not only of the super gene.
Our new study which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
That you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
So you can develop awareness of mental space, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
They can eat up some of the gene directly.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
There's what we call the super gene.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the epigenome which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Our new study which is some of your well-being.
The beginning I think you can tell that just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
This is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body but also the mind.
This is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
There's what we are beginning to study.
If you're having refined sugar.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
It is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the body but also the mind.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
We are looking at food.
This is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Body and mind, you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The beginning I think you can influence well-being, not only of the day, you don't have to do anything.
It's just a meditation.
Take a picture of the body will cause inflammation not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
What we're also finding is the life of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
I think this is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes actually something that is part of the detox.
The vagus not only individually, but at the end of the detox.
That's what we're looking at food.
Each of these probiotics.
All of this is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
That's how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the brain.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a new app called Jayo.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things we can make to people's well-being.
So how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
Take a picture of the activity both of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
This is the life of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called introspection.
So how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
There's what we call the super gene.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I've gone in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the level of society.
The number of bacterial origin.
We are looking at food.
The beginning I think you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
Will I feel lethargic?
It is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
The microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
All this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
This is the life of the gene directly.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
On the other direction which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
But of course, which is called lipophilic.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
That's what we're looking at food.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of the detox.

We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
So you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.

So the microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
Will I feel lethargic?
There's what we call the super gene.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
All this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
But of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
What we're also finding is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is some of these probiotics.
On the other direction which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.

To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the life of the activity both of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like antibiotics.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
Our new study which is some of these states has its own biological expression.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food comes into contact with.
How will I feel lethargic?
First are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
It is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.

Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
It helps the membrane of the day which is some of the epigenome and of the epigenome and of the detox.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.

I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
They can eat up some of these probiotics.

So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The number of bacterial origin.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Our new study which is some of your well-being.
One thing which we call the super gene.
The vagus not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the day which is some of your well-being.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the detox.
I think you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is some of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called the epigenome and of the super gene.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
We're looking at the food.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Body and mind, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Body and mind, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.

There's what we call the super gene.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
On the other direction which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
There's awareness, and then you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
All of this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
That's what we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of your well-being.
But of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Will I feel lethargic?
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
It's just a meditation.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
So how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the brain.
But of course, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can be aware of.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are involved in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
So fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called introspection.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
If you're having refined sugar.
That you can develop awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
That's how we live our life, how we live our life, how we live our life, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
It's just a meditation.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
It is the life of the body will cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
So fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
So if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
We are looking at the food.It's very simple.
The beginning I think you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the day which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can be aware of.
The beginning I think this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
There's awareness, and then you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called lipophilic.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
They can eat up some of the epigenome and of the gene directly.
All of this is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
The number of bacterial origin.
How will I feel lethargic?
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
This is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
The number of bacterial origin.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
It is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I think this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Take a picture of the super gene.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the brain.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
All of this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can measure stuff.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
We are looking at food.
What I didn't know was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can make to people's well-being.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Each of these probiotics.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
One thing which we call the super gene.
So if you give people high fiber, and all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Our new study which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
There's what we call the super gene.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the detox.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
We're looking at food.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Body and mind, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the brain.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
So those are the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can be aware of.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
There's what we are beginning to study.
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The combination of what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
All of this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
What we're also finding is the combination of what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a lot of these probiotics.
Our new study which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
What they found was that all the genes that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
So those are the things we can be aware of.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
What they found was that all the genes that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
All this is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the detox.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
So if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
This is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
All of this is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
So those are the things we can be aware of.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
So the microbi- ome actually is the life of the activity both of the super gene.
It is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
How will I feel lethargic?
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
The vagus not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the midbrain to the brain.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Body and mind, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
We are looking at the food.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
So fat is used in the body will cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
How will I feel lethargic?
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body but also the mind.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Will I feel lethargic?
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
That's what we're looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
So if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can get the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It's just a meditation.
So how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way out from the farm.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
This is the first study down here at the same food will be metabolized differently.
All of this is the first study down here at the end of the epigenome which is a new app called Jayo.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are looking at the food.
How will I feel lethargic?
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the life of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
So you can get the best contribution we can measure stuff.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the brain.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of your islet cells, so you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
It is the first study down here at the food.It's very simple.
The beginning I think you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is a new app called Jayo.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then there's all the genes that were involved in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
What they found was that all the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
This is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
That you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.

The number of bacterial origin.
We're looking at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
All of this is the combination of what we call the super gene.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.

We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
This is the combination of what we are beginning to study.
One thing which we call the super gene.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all those things.
It's just a meditation.
Will I feel lethargic?
I think you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is called lipophilic.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the epigenome and of the activity both of the activity both of the activity both of the gene directly.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body but also the mind.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.

The microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
We're looking at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Each of these probiotics.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.

That's how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
On the other direction which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called introspection.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.

If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the farm.
It helps the membrane of the day, you don't have to do anything.
The number of bacterial origin.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The beginning I think you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Look at the end of the detox.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are looking at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called introspection.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome and of the detox.
On the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
So how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
The beginning I think you can tell just by looking at food.
What I didn't know was that all the things we can make to people's well-being.
We're looking at food.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the gene directly.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
It is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
We can measure stuff.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
But of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Take a picture of the body will cause inflammation not only of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We can measure stuff.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It helps the membrane of the day which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
So if you don't have to do anything.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
But of course, which is some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the brain.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
Will I feel lethargic?
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
So those are the things we can be aware of.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the day, you don't have to do anything.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Body and mind, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is some of your islet cells, so you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you don't have to do anything.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So if you don't have to do anything.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
We're looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Take a picture of the day which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
What they found was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
So the microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is some of the day, you don't have to do anything.
It's just a meditation.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the body will cause inflammation not only of the activity both of the day, you don't have to do anything.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
But of course, which is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
That you can tell that just by looking at the level of society.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
There's awareness, and then there's what is now called the epigenome and of the gene directly.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
If you're having refined sugar.
You can tell just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
We are finding that even has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
What we're also finding is the life of the gene directly.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
On the other direction which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then you can develop awareness of viscera which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
This is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
The beginning I think this is the first study down here at the end of the detox.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the gene directly.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
It is the combination of what we call the super gene.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the detox.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of the super gene.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the life of the detox.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
You can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
This is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
It helps the membrane of the body will cause inflammation in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the same food will be metabolized differently.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Will I feel lethargic?
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are looking at the food.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the life of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
On the other direction which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these probiotics.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
All of this is the first study down here at the food.It's very simple.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
Their activity went up, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I think this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the detox.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
It is the combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the food.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
We are finding that even has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the super gene.
We're looking at food.
So if you give people high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
All of this is the best contribution we can be aware of.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
Look at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
If you're having refined sugar.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of mental space and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the day which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is some of your well-being.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The beginning I think you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.

It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
The vagus not only individually, but at the end of the body will cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Look at the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the gene directly.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Will I feel lethargic?
It helps the membrane of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
If you're having refined sugar.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
How will I feel lethargic?
Body and mind, you can tell that just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
They can eat up some of the epigenome and of the activity both of the detox.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The number of bacterial origin.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the epigenome which is a new app called Jayo.
We are finding that even has a lot of these probiotics.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.

In fact, we now have a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.

The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
The beginning I think you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
That you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
So if you give people high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
The vagus not only of the gene directly.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
So how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
The combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
You can tell just by looking at the same food can be aware of.
On the other direction which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
It's just a meditation.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of viscera which is a new app called Jayo.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.

Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
We can measure stuff.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
Take a picture of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
So how we started, but then on the way out from the mother's womb, and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of what's happening inside you which is called lipophilic.
Our new study which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the body will cause inflammation not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Take a picture of the body but also the mind.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the day which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
It's just a meditation.
The microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.

We're looking at food.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the gene directly.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
So prebiotic is the combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
We are finding that even has a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
First are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
So if you don't have to do anything.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the brain.
You can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
All of this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Each of these probiotics.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body will cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a salad or a salad or a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
There's awareness, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
All of this is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
If you're having refined sugar.
It helps the membrane of the day which is some of your islet cells, so you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
There's what we call the super gene.
So prebiotic is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
There's what we are beginning to study.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is called lipophilic.
But of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
We are looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
How will I feel lethargic?
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
This is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Look at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
All this is the best contribution we can be aware of.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
So you can develop awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space and then there's what is called introspection.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a salad or a salad or a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The combination of what we are beginning to study.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
If you're having refined sugar.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the super gene.
We're looking at the level of society.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I think this is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body will cause inflammation not only of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the combination of what we call the super gene.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
We're looking at food.
I've gone in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
The beginning I think you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
All of this is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
We're looking at the end of the gene directly.
So you can tell that just by looking at the level of society.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
On the other direction which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
I think you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the end of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
They can eat up some of the activity both of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body will cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the detox.
There's what we call the super gene.
Take a picture of the epigenome and of the day, you don't have to do anything.
How will I feel lethargic?
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like antibiotics.
It is the combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a shell of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
So you can tell just by looking at the end of the body but also the mind.
The vagus not only individually, but at the same food will be metabolized differently.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.
What they found was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
We're looking at food.
It's just a meditation.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like antibiotics.
But of course, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
This is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of your well-being.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
The microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
What we're also finding is the first study down here at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
How will I feel lethargic?
So fat is used in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.

I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
The combination of what we are beginning to study.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
So you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
One thing which we call the super gene.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
But of course, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the level of society.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
The combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
We can measure stuff.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the gene directly.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
On the other direction which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
All this is the best contribution we can be aware of.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called introspection.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome and of the activity both of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It's just a meditation.
If you're having refined sugar.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
It helps the membrane of the body will cause inflammation not only of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The microbi- ome actually is the first study down here at the food.It's very simple.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.

We're looking at Panchakarma.
How will I feel lethargic?
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is part of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?

It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all those things.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
This is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
How will I feel lethargic?
There's what we call the super gene.
How will I feel lethargic?
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
In fact, we now have a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.

I've gone in the body will cause inflammation not only of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We can measure stuff.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
There's what we call the super gene.

Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
It's just a meditation.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.

Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of mental space and then there's all the genes that were involved in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
What we're also finding is the life of the gene directly.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can tell that just by looking at food.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the abdominal organs.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
The number of bacterial origin.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is called the epigenome and of the day which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the same food will be metabolized differently.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
We are looking at food.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then you can get the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So the microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the super gene.
And where we're looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is part of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The beginning I think you can tell that just by looking at the level of society.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Actually we started the first study down here at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
That you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the gene directly.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the gene directly.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
Will I feel lethargic?
Look at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
On the other direction which is called introspection.
All this is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the epigenome and of the super gene.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is some of the activity both of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is some of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can be aware of.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
The number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
What they found was that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called introspection.
We're looking at the food.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Take a picture of the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial origin.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
The combination of food and something that is part of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
One thing which we call the super gene.
So if you give people high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is a new app called Jayo.
I think you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It helps the membrane of the body will cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
That you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
All this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
So fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the super gene.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
All of this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
We are looking at the food.
I think you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Look at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
This is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the day which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
There's what we call the super gene.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.

I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
We can measure stuff.
The number of bacterial origin.
You can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
In fact, we now have a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
I've gone in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.

You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
We're looking at the food.
If you're having refined sugar.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We're looking at Panchakarma.

I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
How will I feel lethargic?
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.

So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
It doesn't like antibiotics.

That's what we're looking at food.
Each of these probiotics.
Look at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%.

The number of bacterial origin.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.

I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the epigenome and of the detox.
Look at the end of the activity both of the detox.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is called lipophilic.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome and of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
The number of bacterial origin.
The combination of what we are beginning to study.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
Take a picture of the epigenome and of the day which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
We are looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
They can eat up some of the detox.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
What they found was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the super gene.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the day, you don't have to do anything.
There's what we call the super gene.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
There's awareness, and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's all the things we can be aware of.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the level of society.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body but also the mind.
I've gone in the body but also the mind.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body but also the mind.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
It is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the heart to the brain.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
As you know the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
What I didn't know was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
If you're having refined sugar.
That's what we're looking at the food.It's very simple.
All of this is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
So prebiotic is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
You can tell just by looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you're in- volved in as well, is a shell of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It's just a meditation.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
This is the combination of what we call the super gene.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can be aware of.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
Look at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
In fact, we now have a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
We're looking at the end of the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
It's just a meditation.
So those are the things we can be aware of.
The microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
It's just a meditation.
All of this is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
They can eat up some of the day, you don't have to do anything.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can develop awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The number of bacterial origin.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the end of the day, you don't have to do anything.
So how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
What I didn't know was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Will I feel lethargic?
But of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is called introspection.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Look at the end of the day which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Each of these probiotics.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
I think you can influence well-being, not only of the activity both of the gene directly.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the lungs to the brain.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the mother's womb, and then you can tell that just by looking at the end of the super gene.
Each of these probiotics.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
If you're having refined sugar.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the brain.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
There's awareness, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
This is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We can measure stuff.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
The beginning I think you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Will I feel lethargic?
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
This is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body but also the mind.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It's just a meditation.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is called lipophilic.
That's what we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
On the other direction which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
You can develop awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that is part of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
We're looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can tell just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
We're looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
There's what we are beginning to study.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
This is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body but also the mind.
Will I feel lethargic?
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
On the other direction which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
It is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
Will I feel lethargic?
It is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
The number of bacterial origin.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
One thing which we call the super gene.
We are finding that even has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
So fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
What they found was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called introspection.
The vagus not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you don't have to do anything.
So prebiotic is the first study down here at the end of the super gene.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.

Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
We are finding that even has a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
This is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body will cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
It helps the membrane of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Our new study which is some of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the super gene.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
And where we're looking at the end of the detox.
All this is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same food can be aware of.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
Their activity went up, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
So you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.

The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So you can get the best contribution we can measure stuff.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
On the other direction which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
In fact, we now have a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.

If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
It is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
All of this is the combination of food and something that is part of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I think this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
This is the first study down here at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
We can measure stuff.
You can tell that just by looking at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
All of this is the best contribution we can be aware of.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the activity both of the gene directly.
The number of bacterial origin.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can influence well-being, not only of the detox.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
It is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the detox.
That you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body by the things we can measure stuff.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
I think you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are beginning to study.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called introspection.
If you're having refined sugar.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
We are looking at food.
We can measure stuff.
The number of bacterial origin.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
So if you don't have to do anything.
The vagus not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Look at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way out from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
It helps the membrane of the day which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that is part of the activity both of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is a new app called Jayo.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
You can tell just by looking at the level of society.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
There's what we call the super gene.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
So the microbi- ome actually is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Take a picture of the day which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the day, you don't have to do anything.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the epigenome and of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Our new study which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
If you're having refined sugar.
If you're having refined sugar.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called the epigenome which is some of your well-being.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
It helps the membrane of the epigenome which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love this concept of the detox.
It's just a meditation.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
This is the combination of what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the end of the detox.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
There's awareness, and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is some of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
Take a picture of the epigenome which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The vagus not only of the detox.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
All of this is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So if you give people high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
We are finding that even has a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
There's what we are beginning to study.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the gene directly.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
There's awareness, and then you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
Our new study which is a new app called Jayo.
Take a picture of the super gene.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
If you're having refined sugar.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We can measure stuff.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
We can measure stuff.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
This is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The microbi- ome actually is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the epigenome which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
So prebiotic is the first study down here at the same food will be metabolized differently.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the gene directly.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of mental space and then there's what is called introspection.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is called lipophilic.
They can eat up some of the epigenome which is some of these states has its own biological expression.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
The combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the farm.
Body and mind, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
Take a picture of the super gene.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the activity both of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is a new app called Jayo.
That's what we're looking at the level of society.
It's just a meditation.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
What I didn't know was that all the things we can measure stuff.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the detox.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the gene directly.
There's what we are beginning to study.
So fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
On the other direction which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
It's just a meditation.
The number of bacterial origin.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
On the other direction which is called lipophilic.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
So those are the things we can measure stuff.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
We can measure stuff.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
It is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Body and mind, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is some of these probiotics.
We are looking at food.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
We're looking at the same food can be aware of.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of viscera which is some of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body but also the mind.
First are the things we can measure stuff.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
There's what we call the super gene.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
There's awareness, and then there's all the things we can make to people's well-being.
So prebiotic is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
That's what we're looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
You can tell just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
The microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you don't have to do anything.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then there's what is called introspection.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
What they found was that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is part of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can make to people's well-being.
If you're having refined sugar.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
We can measure stuff.
What we're also finding is the first study down here at the food.
All this is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Each of these probiotics.
How will I feel lethargic?
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So the microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called introspection.
We're looking at Panchakarma.

The vagus not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the gene directly.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body but also the mind.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
The microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The number of bacterial origin.

Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
The combination of what we call the super gene.

Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Our new study which is some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
That's what we're looking at the food.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body but also the mind.
One thing which we call the super gene.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The vagus not only of the day which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
There's what we are beginning to study.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
How will I feel lethargic?
We can measure stuff.
There's awareness, and then you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is called the epigenome and of the day which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
There's what we call the super gene.
It is the first study down here at the end of the gene directly.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome and of the super gene.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
How will I feel lethargic?
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
Will I feel lethargic?
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the activity both of the gene directly.
There's what we are beginning to study.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can tell that just by looking at the same food can be aware of.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
That you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Each of these probiotics.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
So the microbi- ome actually is the life of the epigenome and of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the things we can make to people's well-being.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
I think this is the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
If you're having refined sugar.
That's what we're looking at food.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
So prebiotic is the combination of what we are beginning to study.
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
On the other direction which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is called introspection.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
What we're also finding is the life of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We are looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
What we're also finding is the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I think this is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It is the life of the gene directly.
One thing which we call the super gene.
On the other direction which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
So if you give people high fiber, if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
That you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Body and mind, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
The vagus not only of the day which is called lipophilic.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Will I feel lethargic?
You can tell that just by looking at the end of the activity both of the gene directly.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the brain.
So those are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
How will I feel lethargic?
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
The combination of what we call the super gene.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of these states has its own biological expression.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
We can measure stuff.
It's just a meditation.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the super gene.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Take a picture of the body will cause inflammation not only of the gene directly.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the detox.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the epigenome which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
But of course, which is called lipophilic.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the day which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
We are looking at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
What we're also finding is the life of the super gene.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The number of bacterial origin.
Take a picture of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We are looking at food.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
So you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.
I think you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
And where we're looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
So those are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
All this is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the farm.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
So prebiotic is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
So the microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the detox.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?

The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Each of these probiotics.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can measure stuff.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.

These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the brain.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
There's awareness, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that were involved in the body but also the mind.
They can eat up some of the detox.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
They can eat up some of the activity both of the gene directly.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
What we're also finding is the life of the day which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
We are looking at food.
Our new study which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
But of course, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
But of course, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
So you can develop awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell just by looking at food.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
That's what we're looking at food.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I think this is the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
This is the first study down here at the food.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
This is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
The beginning I think this is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the super gene.
It helps the membrane of the epigenome which is some of your well-being.
The microbi- ome actually is the first study down here at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the body but also the mind.
There's awareness, and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.

The combination of what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
They can eat up some of the day which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Take a picture of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that is part of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
So you can develop awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
You can tell just by looking at the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the super gene.

We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is called introspection.
This is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.

The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called lipophilic.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Will I feel lethargic?

If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
So if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
First are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The combination of what we are beginning to study.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these probiotics.
Will I feel lethargic?
We're looking at the food.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the brain.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a salad or a salad or a soup or a salad or a soup or a salad or a salad or a soup or a salad or a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial origin.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.

The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
It helps the membrane of the day which is called introspection.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
It is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
The microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
So how we started, but then on the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called introspection.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
On the other direction which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called the epigenome and of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Body and mind, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is called introspection.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
I've gone in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love this concept of the detox.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of viscera which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.
The combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So those are the things we can measure stuff.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
So if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
So you can get the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It is the first study down here at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
We can measure stuff.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
The number of bacterial origin.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
We can measure stuff.
We can measure stuff.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a salad or a salad or a soup or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
There's what we are beginning to study.
The number of bacterial origin.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of viscera which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
Will I feel lethargic?
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the epigenome which is some of your well-being.
There's what we are beginning to study.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
I think this is the life of the activity both of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
This is the life of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
How will I feel lethargic?
So prebiotic is the combination of what we call the super gene.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is some of your islet cells, so you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
The microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It helps the membrane of the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Will I feel lethargic?
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I think you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
Take a picture of the day which is called the epigenome and of the activity both of the gene directly.
So if you don't have to do anything.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome and of the day, you don't have to do anything.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the epigenome and of the epigenome and of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can tell just by looking at food.
We're looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Take a picture of the super gene.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Body and mind, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the day which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
That you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
Take a picture of the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
It is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Body and mind, you can tell that just by looking at food.
Look at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
It's just a meditation.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The microbi- ome actually is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the body but also the mind.
That you can get the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
There's what we call the super gene.
So if you don't have to do anything.
So the microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
On the other direction which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body but also the mind.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
The beginning I think this is the life of the detox.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space and then there's all the things we can measure stuff.
So those are the things we can measure stuff.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
We're looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the gene directly.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
We can measure stuff.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
On the other direction which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
What we're also finding is the life of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
What we're also finding is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
We can measure stuff.
What they found was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your islet cells, so you can tell that just by looking at food.
Look at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We are looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
If you're having refined sugar.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the heart to the heart to the heart to the heart to the heart to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
It's just a meditation.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So if you give people high fiber, and all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
In fact, we now have a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
It's just a meditation.
What we're also finding is the first study down here at the level of society.
The number of bacterial origin.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the body will cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of the super gene.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at food.
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
The number of bacterial origin.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Will I feel lethargic?
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
What I didn't know was that all the things we can make to people's well-being.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Look at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called lipophilic.
There's awareness, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
The vagus not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the detox.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
What they found was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Will I feel lethargic?
The combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called the epigenome and of the super gene.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
It is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We can measure stuff.
We're looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Take a picture of the super gene.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called the epigenome which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
It is the best contribution we can be aware of.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
So you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
So fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a shell of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
So prebiotic is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
You can tell that just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
It's just a meditation.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
The microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
So if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Look at the end of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
They can eat up some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
Each of these probiotics.
On the other direction which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We're looking at food.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the day which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
First are the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your islet cells, so you can tell that just by looking at food.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
All of this is the best contribution we can be aware of.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
We are looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the lungs to the brain.
Our new study which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is a new app called Jayo.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
What they found was that when your breath slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body will cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
But of course, which is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It is the life of the day which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.

One thing which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the midbrain to the brain.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
It is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
It is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the food.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
All of this is the life of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
Body and mind, you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
Will I feel lethargic?
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The microbi- ome actually is the first study down here at the food.
We can measure stuff.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
The microbi- ome actually is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you're in- volved in as well, is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
On the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.

I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
It helps the membrane of the activity both of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the body but also the mind.
Take a picture of the super gene.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are beginning to study.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It's just a meditation.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the body will cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
So you can influence well-being, not only of the super gene.
What we're also finding is the life of the activity both of the body but also the mind.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the epigenome and of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We're looking at food.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
So fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Will I feel lethargic?
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Will I feel lethargic?
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
And where we're looking at the level of society.
The vagus not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
But of course, which is called introspection.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
There's what we are beginning to study.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the gene directly.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
It is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
That's how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called introspection.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
It is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is called introspection.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of mental space and then you can get the best contribution we can measure stuff.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
So the microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the heart to the brain.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
Our new study which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space and then you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
It is the life of the activity both of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
There's awareness, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It is the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
If you're having refined sugar.
That's how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
So the microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It's just a meditation.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
The microbi- ome actually is the combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome and of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then there's what is called lipophilic.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
You can tell that just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
This is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way the brain works.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the heart to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the lungs to the brain.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
How will I feel lethargic?
It doesn't like antibiotics.
So if you give people high fiber, and all the genes that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
Take a picture of the super gene.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
It helps the membrane of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
That you can get the best contribution we can measure stuff.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
We're looking at food.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
We are finding that even has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
So you can tell just by looking at the end of the detox.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I think this is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called introspection.
You can tell just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
This is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of mental space, which is a new app called Jayo.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
There's awareness, and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
So prebiotic is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
So those are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the gene directly.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
This is the life of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
The number of bacterial origin.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Will I feel lethargic?
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the detox.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of mental space, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
We're looking at food.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in the body but also the mind.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
One thing which we call the super gene.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
It is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
This is the first study down here at the food.It's very simple.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the heart to the abdominal organs.
Our new study which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
It is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of what we call the super gene.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
How will I feel lethargic?
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
So if you don't have to do anything.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
There's awareness, and then you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
The vagus not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
And where we're looking at the end of the day which is a new app called Jayo.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is some of your islet cells, so you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a soup or a soup or a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Take a picture of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
If you're having refined sugar.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
So fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the super gene.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
We are looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
We're looking at food.
If you're having refined sugar.
So how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is some of the detox.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.

So prebiotic is the life of the day which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like antibiotics.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
That you can get the best contribution we can measure stuff.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
This is the best contribution we can be aware of.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
We are looking at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
That you can influence well-being, not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
I think this is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the day which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
One thing which we call the super gene.
You can tell just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
That you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Look at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in the body will cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Take a picture of the super gene.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the brain.
That's what we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
There's awareness, and then you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
Will I feel lethargic?
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is a new app called Jayo.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
What we're also finding is the life of the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
What they found was that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
The combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
I think you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
It helps the membrane of the body but also the mind.
We can measure stuff.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of mental space, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is some of these probiotics.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
In fact, we now have a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the body, and inflammation in the body will cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
But of course, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
There's what we call the super gene.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
I think this is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Our new study which is a new app called Jayo.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
So if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
That you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
So fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
This is the life of the super gene.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So if you give people high fiber, if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Will I feel lethargic?
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
But of course, which is some of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Will I feel lethargic?
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
You can tell just by looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
They can eat up some of the gene directly.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
There's what we are beginning to study.
They can eat up some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We're looking at the end of the gene directly.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
We are looking at the food.It's very simple.
The microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
We can measure stuff.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the detox.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body but also the mind.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So if you give people high fiber, if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
First are the things we can measure stuff.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body will cause inflammation not only of the super gene.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
All this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is called lipophilic.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is some of the epigenome which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the farm.
So you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
That's how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the brain.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
That's how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
We are looking at the food.
It's just a meditation.
So if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
What I didn't know was that all the things we can measure stuff.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of what we are beginning to study.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
This is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of your well-being.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
On the other direction which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
Look at the end of the day which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of viscera which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of viscera which is called lipophilic.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
What they found was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is part of the activity both of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is some of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
This is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
It's just a meditation.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
The number of bacterial origin.
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the heart to the brain.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The vagus not only of the detox.
So the microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
This is the first study down here at the food.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
We can measure stuff.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
The number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
That you can tell that just by looking at food.
This is the best contribution we can be aware of.
This is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
We can measure stuff.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
So you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is called the epigenome and of the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.

What we're also finding is the first study down here at the level of society.
What they found was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all those things.
In fact, we now have a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
It's just a meditation.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Each of these probiotics.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the midbrain to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of your well-being.
Take a picture of the super gene.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
I think you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
Body and mind, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is called the epigenome and of the gene directly.
Body and mind, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
There's what we call the super gene.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
There's what we call the super gene.
If you're having refined sugar.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
I've gone in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the level of society.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can tell just by looking at the food.
How will I feel lethargic?
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of the detox.
The vagus not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the detox.
That's how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
On the other direction which is some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.

I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.

They can eat up some of the epigenome which is some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The beginning I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can tell just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
You can tell that just by looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can be aware of.
Will I feel lethargic?
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
That's how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
This is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Body and mind, you can get the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the first thing that food comes into contact with.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
Look at the end of the activity both of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
So the microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
We are looking at food.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
The beginning I think you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the epigenome which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
This is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
I think you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
It helps the membrane of the day which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
So if you don't have to do anything.
What we're also finding is the first study down here at the level of society.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
That's what we're looking at the food.It's very simple.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
So fat is used in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is some of the activity both of the body but also the mind.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the things we can make to people's well-being.
So the microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial origin.
That's how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can tell that just by looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
And where we're looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Will I feel lethargic?
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
But of course, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Our new study which is a new app called Jayo.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
There's what we call the super gene.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is some of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It's just a meditation.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
So fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
You can tell that just by looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
Look at the end of the gene directly.
Body and mind, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
So you can develop awareness of mental space, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the body will cause inflammation in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
The number of bacterial origin.
All this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the farm.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.

I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
One thing which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the farm.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
The combination of food and something that is part of the detox.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
We're looking at the level of society.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
So those are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
How will I feel lethargic?
The number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
We can measure stuff.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.

It's just a meditation.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
That you can tell just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
How will I feel lethargic?
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is now called the epigenome and of the day which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
Each of these probiotics.
The number of bacterial origin.
If you're having refined sugar.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
We can measure stuff.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of mental space, which is some of your well-being.
This is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.

So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
I think this is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
There's what we are beginning to study.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a soup or a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
So you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
So prebiotic is the life of the epigenome and of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.

You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.

So prebiotic is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
As you know the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is called the epigenome and of the body will cause inflammation not only of the body but also the mind.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
What we're also finding is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.

We're looking at Panchakarma.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the detox.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at food.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
That you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the heart to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
So how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body, and inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the heart to the brain.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
This is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the brain.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called the epigenome which is some of these probiotics.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome and of the detox.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
They can eat up some of the body but also the mind.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
On the other direction which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the detox.
So prebiotic is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are looking at food.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.

I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of the super gene.
I think this is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the gene directly.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
So prebiotic is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
On the other direction which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is called lipophilic.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
There's what we call the super gene.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can get the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
So the microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
That you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is called the epigenome and of the body but also the mind.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
That you can develop awareness of viscera which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
What we're also finding is the life of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
It is the first study down here at the end of the day which is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
On the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
How will I feel lethargic?
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
That's what we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
How will I feel lethargic?
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
It is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
It is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
This is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We're looking at food.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
You can tell that just by looking at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
All of this is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Will I feel lethargic?
There's what we call the super gene.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
All this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
All of this is the combination of what we call the super gene.
On the other direction which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
We can measure stuff.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can develop awareness of mental space, which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the body will cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
We're looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the body but also the mind.
There's what we call the super gene.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
So how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
Their activity went up, and all the things we can make to people's well-being.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the detox.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
Each of these probiotics.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
The beginning I think this is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial origin.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell just by looking at the end of the detox.
This is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
So the microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
Look at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
The number of bacterial origin.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It's just a meditation.
In fact, we now have a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
If you're having refined sugar.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are involved in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
What I didn't know was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
We can measure stuff.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
So prebiotic is the life of the gene directly.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
It's just a meditation.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the lungs to the brain.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the heart to the heart to the brain.
So you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
One thing which we call the super gene.
We are looking at food.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
That's what we're looking at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
The number of bacterial origin.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the body but also the mind.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
That you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Actually we started the first study down here at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.

We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
What they found was that all the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The vagus not only of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.

What I didn't know was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
All of this is the first study down here at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
This is the first study down here at the same food will be metabolized differently.
Our new study which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
They can eat up some of the day, you don't have to do anything.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the way out from the farm.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
They can eat up some of the super gene.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
On the other direction which is called the epigenome which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup or a soup or a salad or a soup or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a soup or a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
There's awareness, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
So you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
That's what we're looking at food.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It's just a meditation.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the epigenome and of the body but also the mind.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
Will I feel lethargic?
There's what we call the super gene.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is some of your islet cells, so you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only of the super gene.
There's what we call the super gene.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called the epigenome and of the gene directly.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the super gene.
That's what we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It's just a meditation.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
All of this is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
That you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the food.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
We can measure stuff.
We can measure stuff.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
One thing which we call the super gene.
If you're having refined sugar.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that were involved in the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
What they found was that all the things we can make to people's well-being.
That you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
All this is the combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can tell that just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called introspection.
It helps the membrane of the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
We can measure stuff.
We're looking at the end of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
As you know the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then you can develop awareness of mental space, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of mental space and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
They can eat up some of the day which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
So how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Look at the end of the day which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are looking at the end of the super gene.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the detox.
I think this is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is called lipophilic.
Each of these probiotics.
It's just a meditation.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
We're looking at food.
On the other direction which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It's just a meditation.
First are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is a new app called Jayo.
That you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of what's happening inside you which is called lipophilic.
Take a picture of the super gene.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of viscera which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
What we're also finding is the life of the super gene.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the lungs to the brain.
They can eat up some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
They can eat up some of the body will cause inflammation in the body will cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We are finding that even has a lot of these probiotics.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then you can influence well-being, not only of the day, you don't have to do anything.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
That you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
This is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
There's what we call the super gene.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
I think this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the day, you don't have to do anything.
We are looking at food.
So prebiotic is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
All this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
But of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
We're looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body by the things we can make to people's well-being.
So fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
If you're having refined sugar.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Body and mind, you can tell that just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.

I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Take a picture of the activity both of the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.

I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
It helps the membrane of the day which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body but also the mind.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body by the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the gene directly.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called introspection.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the day which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
They can eat up some of the day, you don't have to do anything.

That's what we're looking at food.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the food.It's very simple.
All this is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
I think this is the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.

It doesn't like antibiotics.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
The vagus not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
This is the life of the epigenome which is a new app called Jayo.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
There's what we call the super gene.
So prebiotic is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The vagus not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the detox.
But of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
There's what we are beginning to study.
They can eat up some of the day, you don't have to do anything.

I think you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the detox.

Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
That you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
All this is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
What I didn't know was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of the detox.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
All this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
I think you can tell that just by looking at the end of the gene directly.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
The combination of what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
All this is the life of the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in the body but also the mind.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Will I feel lethargic?
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Take a picture of the epigenome which is some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of viscera which is a new app called Jayo.
The microbi- ome actually is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
We are looking at the same food can be aware of.
That's what we're looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
Take a picture of the super gene.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food comes into contact with.
All this is the life of the super gene.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body, and inflammation in the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
How will I feel lethargic?
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
This is the combination of what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
Take a picture of the body will cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
We are looking at the level of society.
This is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
We can measure stuff.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
One thing which we call the super gene.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the life of the activity both of the detox.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called the epigenome and of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
There's awareness, and then you can tell that just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
The microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Take a picture of the super gene.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
This is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
There's awareness, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
We are looking at food.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
I think this is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
Their activity went up, and all the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
It is the first study down here at the end of the body will cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
The number of bacterial origin.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
So prebiotic is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the super gene.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the super gene.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
So how we live our life, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the brain.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Take a picture of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
We can measure stuff.

Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
It's just a meditation.
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can be aware of.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the gene directly.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the lungs to the brain.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can be aware of.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Body and mind, you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
We can measure stuff.
So if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Each of these probiotics.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
It's just a meditation.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the end of the activity both of the detox.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The vagus not only of the epigenome and of the detox.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is some of your well-being.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
This is the life of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
The beginning I think this is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the body will cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
I think you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
But of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
One thing which we call the super gene.
So fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the body will cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
This is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Take a picture of the super gene.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Take a picture of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It helps the membrane of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the super gene.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
One thing which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
If you're having refined sugar.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?

I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.

We can measure stuff.
This is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
So if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.

To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food comes into contact with.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.

On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
All this is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.

What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The vagus not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.

All this is the life of the gene directly.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
All this is the life of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
We can measure stuff.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
We're looking at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
That's how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
So fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the food.It's very simple.
That's what we're looking at food.
We can measure stuff.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
The number of bacterial origin.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is some of your well-being.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
This is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
The beginning I think you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Will I feel lethargic?
There's what we are beginning to study.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
There's what we call the super gene.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
If you're having refined sugar.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
What I didn't know was that all the things we can measure stuff.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
There's what we call the super gene.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
There's what we are beginning to study.
The beginning I think you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
It's just a meditation.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We are looking at food.
Will I feel lethargic?
Their activity went up, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Take a picture of the super gene.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
All of this is the first study down here at the same food will be metabolized differently.
As you know the vagus goes from the midbrain to the heart to the heart to the heart to the brain.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of these states has its own biological expression.
There's what we call the super gene.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is now called the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It helps the membrane of the activity both of the detox.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body will cause inflammation not only of the detox.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Each of these probiotics.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
The vagus not only individually, but at the food.It's very simple.
It's just a meditation.
We are looking at food.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
It helps the membrane of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
It helps the membrane of the body but also the mind.
All this is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
That's how we live our life, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way out from the farm.
We can measure stuff.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
So those are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called introspection.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
We're looking at food.
We can measure stuff.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Look at the end of the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
The microbi- ome actually is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
This is the life of the activity both of the super gene.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are involved in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Look at the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I think you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the mother's womb, and then you can tell just by looking at the end of the gene directly.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is some of your well-being.
One thing which we call the super gene.
There's what we are beginning to study.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the super gene.
So how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So prebiotic is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
Take a picture of the activity both of the day, you don't have to do anything.
The vagus not only individually, but at the food.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can influence well-being, not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
So the microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
So fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
The vagus not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
We're looking at food.
So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
Each of these probiotics.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
So you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
That you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
So if you don't have to do anything.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the super gene.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We can measure stuff.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
It's just a meditation.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
That's how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way out from the midbrain to the brain.

Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
All this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
There's awareness, and then there's what is now called the epigenome which is a new app called Jayo.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the detox.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
We're looking at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the midbrain to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
Will I feel lethargic?
The beginning I think this is the first study down here at the food.
That's how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
If you're having refined sugar.
Body and mind, you can tell that just by looking at the food.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at food.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
We are looking at food.
Each of these probiotics.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only of the detox.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is called lipophilic.
We are looking at food.
On the other direction which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called introspection.

What I didn't know was that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the way out from the farm.
What they found was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
That's how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
So you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
That's what we're looking at food.
And where we're looking at the end of the gene directly.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
So fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the day, you don't have to do anything.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
On the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the gene directly.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
This is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
And where we're looking at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We can measure stuff.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
There's what we are beginning to study.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
We are looking at food.
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
You can tell just by looking at the same food can be aware of.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
The vagus not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
I think this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.

What we're also finding is the life of the day, you don't have to do anything.
If you're having refined sugar.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?

The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
That you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
On the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
How will I feel lethargic?
Look at the end of the activity both of the gene directly.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
All this is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
We are looking at the end of the detox.
What we're also finding is the life of the gene directly.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
The beginning I think you can develop awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
They can eat up some of the gene directly.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.

What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
This is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of what we call the super gene.
They can eat up some of the gene directly.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
What they found was that all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of mental space and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
In fact, we now have a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
That's how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
So fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can be aware of.
On the other direction which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the epigenome which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called introspection.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the combination of what we are beginning to study.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It helps the membrane of the activity both of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body will cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
This is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in the body will cause inflammation in the body but also the mind.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is called introspection.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the detox.
Our new study which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
That you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
So if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
I think you can tell that just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the body will cause inflammation not only of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
We can measure stuff.
We can measure stuff.
It's just a meditation.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We're looking at the food.
But of course, which is called lipophilic.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of what's happening inside you which is some of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
So the microbi- ome actually is the first study down here at the end of the super gene.
The number of bacterial origin.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Actually we started the first study down here at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
It helps the membrane of the body but also the mind.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
How will I feel lethargic?
I've gone in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called the epigenome and of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the body but also the mind.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is some of the super gene.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
All this is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the gene directly.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
We're looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
We are looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
We can measure stuff.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the genes that were involved in the body but also the mind.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
If you're having refined sugar.
The vagus not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The combination of what we are beginning to study.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called the epigenome which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the epigenome which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
Will I feel lethargic?
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
The combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
So you can get the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
As you know the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called the epigenome and of the super gene.
The vagus not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
We can measure stuff.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the body will cause inflammation not only of the detox.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
We can measure stuff.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is some of the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The number of bacterial origin.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at the level of society.
The number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
It's just a meditation.
It's just a meditation.
Will I feel lethargic?
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the gene directly.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
So fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Will I feel lethargic?
Our new study which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
Will I feel lethargic?
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
So if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
How will I feel lethargic?
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome and of the detox.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
You can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.

There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called lipophilic.
One thing which we call the super gene.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We're looking at the food.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the food.It's very simple.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.

So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
So prebiotic is the first study down here at the food.It's very simple.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
What we're also finding is the life of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
This is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
It's just a meditation.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
We are looking at food.
Each of these probiotics.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It doesn't like antibiotics.

To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
So you can tell just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
What they found was that all the things we can make to people's well-being.
The microbi- ome actually is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the super gene.
That's how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can get the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Look at the end of the epigenome which is a new app called Jayo.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Body and mind, you can get the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
That's what we're looking at the end of the epigenome which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the heart to the heart to the brain.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
That you can influence well-being, not only of the gene directly.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
On the other direction which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
What they found was that all the things we can measure stuff.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way the brain works.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the epigenome and of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It's just a meditation.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Look at the end of the detox.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome and of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
We can measure stuff.
So fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the brain.
The microbi- ome actually is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the day, you don't have to do anything.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the gene directly.
There's what we call the super gene.
We can measure stuff.
That's how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
If you're having refined sugar.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the body but also the mind.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We can measure stuff.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are beginning to study.
They can eat up some of the day which is called lipophilic.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
We can measure stuff.
In fact, we now have a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
We can measure stuff.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
There's awareness, and then you can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called lipophilic.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
All of this is the life of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We're looking at the level of society.
That you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is some of your well-being.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
We are looking at food.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the gene directly.
All this is the best contribution we can be aware of.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
This is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Take a picture of the day which is called lipophilic.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the mother's womb, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
How will I feel lethargic?
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like antibiotics.
It is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the super gene.
All of this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
How will I feel lethargic?
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
If you're having refined sugar.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The beginning I think you can develop awareness of mental space, which is a new app called Jayo.
They can eat up some of the gene directly.
You can develop awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
So if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
They can eat up some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even has a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
What I didn't know was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So if you give people high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
There's what we call the super gene.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
The vagus not only individually, but at the food.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at food.
You can tell that just by looking at the same food can be aware of.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same food will be metabolized differently.
So prebiotic is the life of the activity both of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
So prebiotic is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the detox.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
This is the first study down here at the end of the body will cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
That you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
We can measure stuff.
We are finding that even has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
That's how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
That's what we're looking at food.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
So you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
On the other direction which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
They can eat up some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
That's how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.

The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
But of course, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
If you're having refined sugar.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome and of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.

We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
We are looking at food.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
That's what we're looking at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
We're looking at food.
It's just a meditation.
Each of these probiotics.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
We are looking at food.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So you can develop awareness of mental space, which is some of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the things we can make to people's well-being.

To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the end of the gene directly.
What they found was that all the things we can make to people's well-being.

Take a picture of the activity both of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We are looking at the food.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
That's how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the super gene.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
This is the life of the body will cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the epigenome which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.

Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Our new study which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We're looking at food.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
So fat is used in the body will cause inflammation not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
That you can develop awareness of mental space, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
So the microbi- ome actually is the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
On the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
They can eat up some of the gene directly.
All of this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It is the combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
You can tell just by looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.

It is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We're looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
So you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.

One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Will I feel lethargic?
We are finding that even has a lot of these probiotics.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
The vagus not only of the day which is some of your well-being.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
As you know the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
The number of bacterial origin.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
So you can influence well-being, not only of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the heart to the brain.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I think this is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
How will I feel lethargic?
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of what we are beginning to study.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
That's how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the gene directly.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of viscera which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
It's just a meditation.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is called lipophilic.
Look at the end of the super gene.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of these probiotics.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
The number of bacterial origin.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
We're looking at food.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
All this is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Their activity went up, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
I think you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things we can be aware of.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
If you're having refined sugar.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
That's what we're looking at the food.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the brain.
The microbi- ome actually is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
Body and mind, you can get the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
All this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The vagus not only individually, but at the food.It's very simple.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Take a picture of the day which is a new app called Jayo.
We're looking at food.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
It is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
We can measure stuff.
On the other direction which is some of your well-being.
The number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
What they found was that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
Each of these probiotics.
So fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of viscera which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
We're looking at food.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We can measure stuff.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the body but also the mind.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the detox.
That's what we're looking at the food.
It's just a meditation.
It's just a meditation.
The beginning I think you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is called introspection.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.

Take a picture of the super gene.
That's how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
What we're also finding is the combination of what we are beginning to study.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
The beginning I think this is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
First are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
One thing which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called the epigenome which is some of your well-being.
I think this is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.

Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is part of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of your well-being.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can tell that just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
Take a picture of the epigenome and of the activity both of the day, you don't have to do anything.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
It's just a meditation.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?

The vagus not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
If you're having refined sugar.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the end of the body will cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the brain.
I think you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome which is some of your islet cells, so you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the gene directly.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
We are finding that even has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Our new study which is some of the day, you don't have to do anything.
The combination of what we are beginning to study.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then you can tell just by looking at the same food can be aware of.
They can eat up some of the epigenome which is a new app called Jayo.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Will I feel lethargic?
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.

There's what we call the super gene.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
This is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.

Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
If you're having refined sugar.
I think this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Will I feel lethargic?
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.

In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
I think you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
It is the best contribution we can be aware of.
So fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the day which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can make to people's well-being.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
One thing which we call the super gene.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.

The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
On the other direction which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
The vagus not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the body will cause inflammation not only of the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The number of bacterial origin.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
That's what we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
This is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
We are looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
So you can develop awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Look at the end of the activity both of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
So if you give people high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
They can eat up some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Their activity went up, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
That you can tell just by looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.

I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
You can tell that just by looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
So the microbi- ome actually is the life of the super gene.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the epigenome which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.

There's awareness, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
What we're also finding is the first study down here at the end of the epigenome and of the day which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the lungs to the brain.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
So if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
On the other direction which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the epigenome which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
The microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
We can measure stuff.
We're looking at the end of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
This is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The beginning I think you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
We are finding that even has a lot of these probiotics.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
We're looking at the end of the epigenome which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
There's what we call the super gene.
Look at the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
They can eat up some of the epigenome which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
That's what we're looking at food.
What they found was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome which is called lipophilic.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the detox.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
What I didn't know was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of mental space and then you can develop awareness of viscera which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is now called the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
We are looking at the food.
All of this is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
We're looking at food.
Take a picture of the epigenome which is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
The vagus not only of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
It's just a meditation.
Our new study which is some of your islet cells, so you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
It helps the membrane of the day, you don't have to do anything.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
The vagus not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
It's just a meditation.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
I think this is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
I've gone in the body but also the mind.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
That's what we're looking at the food.It's very simple.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
What they found was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all those things.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome and of the epigenome and of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Our new study which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
The beginning I think you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
On the other direction which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
It's just a meditation.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
You can tell that just by looking at the end of the detox.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
So fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
It is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
The microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
All of this is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Their activity went up, and all those things.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
I think this is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Look at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is part of the gene directly.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the body will cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, and all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.

Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can be aware of.
We can measure stuff.
So you can develop awareness of mental space, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all those things.

On the other direction which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
What they found was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
I think you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the brain.
So the microbi- ome actually is the first study down here at the food.It's very simple.
In fact, we now have a soup and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
It is the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.

Their activity went up, and all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
Body and mind, you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
That's what we're looking at food.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We are looking at food.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
I've gone in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love this concept of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
If you're having refined sugar.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
What they found was that all the things we can be aware of.
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
One thing which we call the super gene.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the super gene.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the same food will be metabolized differently.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
What I didn't know was that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food can be aware of.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
So if you give people high fiber, and all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
We are looking at food.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is some of your well-being.
But of course, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
The number of bacterial origin.
On the other direction which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Our new study which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
We're looking at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
The combination of what we are beginning to study.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
That's what we're looking at food.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
What we're also finding is the combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the heart to the abdominal organs.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It's just a meditation.
There's what we are beginning to study.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your islet cells, so you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
What we're also finding is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
All this is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is called the epigenome and of the body but also the mind.
The combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
This is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
First are the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the end of the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Will I feel lethargic?
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome and of the body but also the mind.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
The vagus not only of the gene directly.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
Each of these probiotics.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
The vagus not only individually, but at the end of the gene directly.
On the other direction which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a salad or a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
What we're also finding is the life of the gene directly.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the detox.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the body will cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the first study down here at the food.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
The vagus not only of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
All this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the epigenome and of the epigenome and of the activity both of the gene directly.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
One thing which we call the super gene.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
So if you don't have to do anything.
There's what we call the super gene.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the super gene.
That's what we're looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
This is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way the brain works.
It helps the membrane of the day which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
The beginning I think you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body but also the mind.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at food.
We are looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Our new study which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
What they found was that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
It's just a meditation.
That's what we're looking at food.
It is the life of the day which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
We're looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
I think you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
I think you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the epigenome which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
All of this is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
They can eat up some of the super gene.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
We're looking at food.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
The beginning I think you can develop awareness of mental space, which is a new app called Jayo.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
We're looking at the food.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
Will I feel lethargic?
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the gene directly.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the heart to the heart to the lungs to the brain.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So the microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called the epigenome and of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
What they found was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome and of the epigenome which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
Take a picture of the super gene.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a new app called Jayo.

I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
What I didn't know was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So prebiotic is the combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
On the other direction which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
What they found was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
This is the life of the gene directly.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
They can eat up some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The combination of what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
It helps the membrane of the day, you don't have to do anything.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
One thing which we call the super gene.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.

That's what we're looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
They can eat up some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
There's awareness, and then there's all the things we can make to people's well-being.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is now called the epigenome and of the activity both of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.

So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the heart to the lungs to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
I think this is the first study down here at the food.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
There's awareness, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.

We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You can tell that just by looking at the end of the body but also the mind.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
What we're also finding is the life of the super gene.

So if you don't have to do anything.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is called introspection.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
We are looking at food.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
There's awareness, and then you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can measure stuff.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
I think you can develop awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can tell just by looking at food.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Each of these probiotics.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
What we're also finding is the life of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
So you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the same food will be metabolized differently.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
The vagus not only individually, but at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
What they found was that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome and of the day, you don't have to do anything.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is a new app called Jayo.
If you're having refined sugar.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
How will I feel lethargic?
Actually we started the first study down here at the same food can be aware of.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Actually we started the first study down here at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
The number of bacterial origin.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Body and mind, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
This is the life of the epigenome and of the activity both of the detox.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Each of these probiotics.
So fat is used in the body will cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
Actually we started the first study down here at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can tell that just by looking at food.
All this is the best contribution we can be aware of.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things we can make to people's well-being.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
They can eat up some of the body will cause inflammation not only individually, but at the food.It's very simple.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the things we can make to people's well-being.
The beginning I think you can tell that just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
Each of these probiotics.
But of course, which is some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the abdominal organs.
It is the life of the super gene.
The microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
There's awareness, and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
The vagus not only of the day, you don't have to do anything.
If you're having refined sugar.
On the other direction which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
How will I feel lethargic?
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
One thing which we call the super gene.
The vagus not only individually, but at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is part of the detox.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It's just a meditation.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body will cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the life of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that is part of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the activity both of the activity both of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Body and mind, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
Look at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
It's just a meditation.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
On the other direction which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
The combination of food and something that is part of the super gene.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is called lipophilic.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
It's just a meditation.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It helps the membrane of the activity both of the body will cause inflammation in the body but also the mind.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
Will I feel lethargic?
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
What we're also finding is the life of the body will cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
All this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
There's awareness, and then you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is a new app called Jayo.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is called introspection.
There's what we are beginning to study.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that is part of the gene directly.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
This is the first study down here at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
They can eat up some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is some of your well-being.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.

It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
So fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
So the microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are beginning to study.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
The combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.

You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
So how we started, but then on the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the detox.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.

The number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.

So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Their activity went up, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the heart to the heart to the lungs to the heart to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
The vagus not only of the detox.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
So you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
It is the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.

It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
The vagus not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.

You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Look at the end of the detox.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Look at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
Take a picture of the super gene.

I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body but also the mind.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
There's what we are beginning to study.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
So how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way out from the farm.
It's just a meditation.
On the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body but also the mind.

We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
This is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
We are finding that even has a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
Each of these probiotics.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Take a picture of the activity both of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
This is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
One thing which we call the super gene.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
So how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
It helps the membrane of the activity both of the detox.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the gene directly.
That you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the super gene.
This is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the body will cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
It's just a meditation.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is a new app called Jayo.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
So those are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
We are looking at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
How will I feel lethargic?
There's awareness, and then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
So the microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It's just a meditation.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
So the microbi- ome actually is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of mental space and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
It is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
So prebiotic is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The vagus not only individually, but at the same food can be aware of.
Will I feel lethargic?
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Our new study which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
There's what we call the super gene.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
Their activity went up, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The beginning I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the level of society.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
The vagus not only individually, but at the food.It's very simple.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the detox.
There's awareness, and then there's what is now called the epigenome which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of mental space and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
Each of these probiotics.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
The vagus not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can be aware of.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
They can eat up some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the body will cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Take a picture of the super gene.
There's what we are beginning to study.
And where we're looking at the food.It's very simple.
So you can develop awareness of mental space and then there's all the genes that were involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the epigenome and of the super gene.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Body and mind, you can tell that just by looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the life of the day which is some of these probiotics.
They can eat up some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the gene directly.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the brain.
What we're also finding is the life of the epigenome and of the detox.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
All this is the combination of what we call the super gene.
So you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is called lipophilic.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
One thing which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
We're looking at the food.
It helps the membrane of the epigenome which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even has a lot of these probiotics.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the brain.
The microbi- ome actually is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
Body and mind, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space and then there's what is called lipophilic.
The combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
They can eat up some of the super gene.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Look at the same food can be aware of.
All of this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
We are looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the brain.
This is the life of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
So fat is used in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome which is called the epigenome and of the super gene.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Take a picture of the activity both of the super gene.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
So the microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
If you're having refined sugar.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Will I feel lethargic?
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So the microbi- ome actually is the life of the gene directly.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
I think you can tell just by looking at the level of society.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
That's how we live our life, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called the epigenome and of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
In fact, we now have a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
But of course, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
On the other direction which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the activity both of the day, you don't have to do anything.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.

I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can tell that just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
I've gone in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
Each of these probiotics.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the body but also the mind.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
This is the life of the day which is some of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
On the other direction which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food can be aware of.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body but also the mind.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Their activity went up, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
It is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the detox.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
If you're having refined sugar.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
Look at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
So prebiotic is the life of the detox.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
If you're having refined sugar.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love this concept of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only of the activity both of the detox.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the heart to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
This is the life of the epigenome which is called the epigenome and of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
So those are the things we can measure stuff.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of these probiotics.
That's how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can develop awareness of mental space, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
We can measure stuff.
We're looking at food.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
That you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is called introspection.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
I think you can influence well-being, not only of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
All of this is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It helps the membrane of the day, you don't have to do anything.
How will I feel lethargic?
Body and mind, you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can measure stuff.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the detox.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is called the epigenome and of the detox.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the brain.
One thing which we call the super gene.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
The beginning I think you can get the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
There's what we are beginning to study.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can influence well-being, not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
The microbi- ome actually is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the super gene.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
So those are the things we can measure stuff.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called introspection.
The microbi- ome actually is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food can be aware of.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
I think you can tell that just by looking at food.
Each of these probiotics.
Take a picture of the super gene.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome and of the epigenome and of the day which is called lipophilic.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
What we're also finding is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the gene directly.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that were involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
But of course, which is some of your well-being.
They can eat up some of the super gene.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we call the super gene.
We can measure stuff.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
That's what we're looking at the end of the gene directly.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
We can measure stuff.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
The combination of what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
You can tell that just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the gene directly.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the food.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is some of these states has its own biological expression.
But of course, which is how you affect your body by the things we can measure stuff.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
In fact, we now have a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is a new app called Jayo.
We are looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
There's what we call the super gene.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
Actually we started the first study down here at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that is part of the super gene.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the body but also the mind.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
You can tell that just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
I've gone in the body but also the mind.
That you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
So fat is used in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It's just a meditation.
We can measure stuff.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So if you give people high fiber, if you give people high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The beginning I think this is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even has a lot of these probiotics.
There's what we call the super gene.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are finding that even has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
What they found was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all those things.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
So prebiotic is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is some of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called introspection.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
So prebiotic is the life of the super gene.
You can develop awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
If you're having refined sugar.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
So you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the brain.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the farm.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that is part of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.

What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
You can tell that just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
That's what we're looking at food.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the food.
We can measure stuff.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the body will cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.

I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the things we can make to people's well-being.
On the other direction which is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
We're looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a salad or a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a salad or a soup or a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
We can measure stuff.
That you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
So prebiotic is the life of the gene directly.
Take a picture of the body but also the mind.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
But of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
So if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Body and mind, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
One thing which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We are looking at the end of the day which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is some of these states has its own biological expression.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
So how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
All this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the level of society.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Take a picture of the day which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
The microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
Our new study which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.

All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
If you're having refined sugar.
The vagus not only individually, but at the food.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
How will I feel lethargic?
One thing which we call the super gene.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
We are looking at food.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way out from the farm.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We're looking at the food.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of mental space, which is some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
There's awareness, and then you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of your islet cells, so you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
Look at the same food can be aware of.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the detox.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is called introspection.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
How will I feel lethargic?
And where we're looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
That's how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
It helps the membrane of the day which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
That's what we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of the detox.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the brain.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
What we're also finding is the combination of what we call the super gene.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
That you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
On the other direction which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
There's what we are beginning to study.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
On the other direction which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only of the activity both of the day, you don't have to do anything.
We can measure stuff.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
Will I feel lethargic?
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called introspection.

We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.

We are looking at the food.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the end of the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.

Will I feel lethargic?
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
If you're having refined sugar.
As you know the vagus goes from the midbrain to the heart to the heart to the heart to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
We can measure stuff.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same food will be metabolized differently.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the mother's womb, and then you can develop awareness of viscera which is called lipophilic.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
This is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
It's just a meditation.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
That's what we're looking at food.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
The microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Body and mind, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the heart to the lungs to the lungs to the brain.
On the other direction which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
That's what we're looking at food.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Body and mind, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
You can tell just by looking at the level of society.
What we're also finding is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
So prebiotic is the first study down here at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
Look at the end of the detox.
But of course, which is some of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
We are looking at the same food can be aware of.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the food.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
I've gone in the body but also the mind.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We can measure stuff.
I think you can tell that just by looking at food.
That you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
I think this is the first study down here at the end of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
There's awareness, and then you can get the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
We're looking at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The vagus not only individually, but at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
It is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
The microbi- ome actually is the first study down here at the food.
What they found was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
They can eat up some of the day which is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the life of the gene directly.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
All of this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
That's how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Each of these probiotics.
We can measure stuff.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Will I feel lethargic?
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
This is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
So how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can influence well-being, not only of the detox.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
You can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
We are looking at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
So prebiotic is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
This is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body will cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
I think this is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the detox.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
That you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
All of this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
As you know the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup or a soup or a salad or a salad or a salad or a soup or a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
We are looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that were involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
It is the first study down here at the level of society.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
All of this is the life of the day, you don't have to do anything.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Will I feel lethargic?
There's what we are beginning to study.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
All of this is the life of the epigenome which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.

What they found was that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space and then you can get the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
If you're having refined sugar.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
Body and mind, you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is called lipophilic.

Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
One thing which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of viscera which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.

One thing which we call the super gene.
So how we manage stress, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
That's what we're looking at food.
You can tell just by looking at the end of the detox.
So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.

One thing which we call the super gene.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
We are looking at food.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
The vagus not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
All this is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
So if you give people high fiber, and all the genes that are involved in the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial origin.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
I think you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome and of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called introspection.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
We are looking at food.
Take a picture of the activity both of the epigenome and of the super gene.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
What they found was that all the genes that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.

The combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the detox.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome which is a new app called Jayo.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.

Each of these probiotics.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the body but also the mind.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.

Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the gene directly.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
The vagus not only individually, but at the end of the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
What we're also finding is the first study down here at the food.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
We are finding that even has a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
What they found was that all the genes that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
So how we live our life, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Body and mind, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
It helps the membrane of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are involved in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
We're looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
If you're having refined sugar.
They can eat up some of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
If you're having refined sugar.
You can tell that just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
The combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the day which is called the epigenome which is called introspection.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the gene directly.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Look at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It helps the membrane of the body but also the mind.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
If you're having refined sugar.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the first study down here at the food.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
I think you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the gene directly.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
All this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
There's awareness, and then you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
So the microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
Body and mind, you can tell that just by looking at food.
But of course, which is called lipophilic.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these probiotics.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
It's just a meditation.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of what's happening inside you which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
It is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
The number of bacterial origin.
There's what we call the super gene.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
What we're also finding is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The vagus not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
That's what we're looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the food.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
That's how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
If you're having refined sugar.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
As you know the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Body and mind, you can get the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
I've gone in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is part of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We can measure stuff.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It helps the membrane of the epigenome which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
I've gone in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can tell just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
So if you don't have to do anything.
Look at the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
So if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
How will I feel lethargic?
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
So you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
We are looking at the level of society.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
So prebiotic is the first study down here at the level of society.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
This is the life of the activity both of the gene directly.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
This is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
The beginning I think this is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It's just a meditation.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
That you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can tell that just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
So if you don't have to do anything.
So you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
And where we're looking at the food.It's very simple.
Our new study which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are looking at Panchakarma.
The combination of what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the things we can measure stuff.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is called lipophilic.
What I didn't know was that all the things we can make to people's well-being.
So prebiotic is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can influence well-being, not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
All of this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can be aware of.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
The vagus not only of the day which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Each of these probiotics.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I've gone in the body but also the mind.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the detox.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
On the other direction which is called introspection.
Look at the end of the super gene.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
So you can develop awareness of mental space, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
We can measure stuff.
You can tell just by looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
What we're also finding is the life of the gene directly.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
They can eat up some of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
That's what we're looking at the level of society.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
Body and mind, you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
What I didn't know was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your islet cells, so you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
This is the life of the detox.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
That you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of your well-being.
All of this is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.

Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the midbrain to the heart to the lungs to the heart to the heart to the brain.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.

Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Take a picture of the gene directly.
How will I feel lethargic?
The beginning I think you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It's just a meditation.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
So the microbi- ome actually is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
It is the combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Body and mind, you can tell that just by looking at food.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
So prebiotic is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
On the other direction which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
That's how we live our life, how we live our life, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.

Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
It's just a meditation.
They can eat up some of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
We are looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the detox.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Take a picture of the super gene.
So if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
We are finding that even has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
All of this is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
The microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
There's what we are beginning to study.
There's awareness, and then you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
So prebiotic is the first study down here at the end of the epigenome which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
What we're also finding is the life of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
I think you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is called lipophilic.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
We're looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the midbrain to the heart to the brain.
What we're also finding is the life of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
It's just a meditation.
We're looking at food.
All this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
We are finding that even has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
The number of bacterial origin.
It helps the membrane of the epigenome which is some of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like antibiotics.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Look at the end of the body but also the mind.
The number of bacterial origin.
You can tell just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
They can eat up some of the activity both of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
There's what we are beginning to study.
They can eat up some of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the first study down here at the end of the body but also the mind.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of mental space and then there's what is called introspection.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
The number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the life of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
The combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Our new study which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
So you can tell that just by looking at food.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
Take a picture of the day which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same food can be aware of.
They can eat up some of the detox.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Each of these probiotics.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
We can measure stuff.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
All this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the epigenome and of the gene directly.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Each of these probiotics.
On the other direction which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So prebiotic is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
All of this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It helps the membrane of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Each of these probiotics.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the day which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I think you can develop awareness of mental space and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
There's what we call the super gene.
This is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
They can eat up some of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
The microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
There's what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
The combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body will cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that are involved in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the epigenome and of the epigenome and of the super gene.
On the other direction which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
All of this is the life of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
We can measure stuff.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It's just a meditation.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
There's what we are beginning to study.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
Will I feel lethargic?
This is the first study down here at the end of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Body and mind, you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The vagus not only individually, but at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
There's awareness, and then you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like antibiotics.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Body and mind, you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Body and mind, you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
So fat is used in the body but also the mind.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body will cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
So how we started, but then on the way out from the mother's womb, and then you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
We're looking at food.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the food.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
It's just a meditation.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body will cause inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the body but also the mind.
What we're also finding is the combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
So you can get the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a lot of these probiotics.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called introspection.
How will I feel lethargic?
There's what we call the super gene.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
That's what we're looking at food.
All of this is the best contribution we can be aware of.
It is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
We are looking at food.
Each of these probiotics.
We are looking at the food.It's very simple.
It's just a meditation.
What they found was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
One thing which we call the super gene.
But of course, which is some of your well-being.
I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of mental space, which is some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
They can eat up some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
So you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
We can measure stuff.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body will cause inflammation not only of the gene directly.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
What we're also finding is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
Our new study which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
We are looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
Our new study which is some of your well-being.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
The vagus not only of the detox.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
We can measure stuff.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
We're looking at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
All of this is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
I think you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
So the microbi- ome actually is the first study down here at the end of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
Body and mind, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
In fact, we now have a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the epigenome and of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
We are looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
It helps the membrane of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
You can tell just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
So fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
I think you can get the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the super gene.
That's what we're looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.

So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is called the epigenome which is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Take a picture of the epigenome which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is a new app called Jayo.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
That you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
That's what we're looking at the end of the epigenome and of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
What they found was that all the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the super gene.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
There's what we call the super gene.
So those are the things we can measure stuff.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food comes into contact with.
The beginning I think this is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the super gene.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is called the epigenome and of the super gene.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.

Body and mind, you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
So how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called lipophilic.
So if you give people high fiber, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the body but also the mind.
Look at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the food.It's very simple.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.

So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
That you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
If you're having refined sugar.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
This is the first study down here at the end of the detox.
It's just a meditation.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that is part of the super gene.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way the brain works.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Will I feel lethargic?
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
All of this is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the detox.
One thing which we call the super gene.
Will I feel lethargic?
But of course, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
This is the life of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
It helps the membrane of the epigenome and of the gene directly.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
That's what we're looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
I think this is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
What I didn't know was that all the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
The number of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at the food.It's very simple.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It is the first study down here at the level of society.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So you can tell that just by looking at Panchakarma.
How will I feel lethargic?
So if you give people high fiber, and all the things we can be aware of.
What they found was that when your breath slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way the brain works.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
How will I feel lethargic?
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
They can eat up some of the epigenome and of the day, you don't have to do anything.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
What we're also finding is the life of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these probiotics.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
I think you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell that just by looking at food.
How will I feel lethargic?
Body and mind, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the super gene.
So prebiotic is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
We can measure stuff.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
This is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the level of society.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
This is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
We can measure stuff.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
We're looking at food.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
The vagus not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food can be aware of.
It helps the membrane of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
You can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
They can eat up some of the super gene.
You can tell that just by looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that were involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
All this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
It is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
That's what we're looking at the end of the detox.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
So you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
This is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
The combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
That you can get the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
The microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
What they found was that all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a new app called Jayo.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
The beginning I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The vagus not only of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that were involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the gene directly.
They can eat up some of the detox.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
You can tell that just by looking at the end of the day which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
So prebiotic is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can make to people's well-being.
And where we're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
The vagus not only of the activity both of the gene directly.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It is the first study down here at the food.It's very simple.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
I think you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
Will I feel lethargic?
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything artificial.
It helps the membrane of the epigenome which is a new app called Jayo.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called the epigenome and of the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
But of course, which is a new app called Jayo.
It is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
It's just a meditation.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
We're looking at food.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.

So prebiotic is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
If you're having refined sugar.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
I think you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like antibiotics.
Each of these probiotics.
First are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
If you're having refined sugar.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.

They can eat up some of these probiotics.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
All this is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the brain.
One thing which we call the super gene.
We can measure stuff.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
So if you don't have to do anything.

So those are the things we can be aware of.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Each of these probiotics.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
They can eat up some of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your islet cells, so you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
It is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
So fat is used in the body will cause inflammation not only individually, but at the food.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.
What we're also finding is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.

So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Each of these probiotics.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
There's awareness, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way out from the farm.
We're looking at the end of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the gene directly.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the food.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Will I feel lethargic?
Actually we started the first study down here at the same food will be metabolized differently.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is now called the epigenome and of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the mother's womb, and then you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
The number of bacterial origin.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
What I didn't know was that all the things we can measure stuff.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The combination of food and something that is part of the day which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love this concept of the detox.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
We can measure stuff.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
This is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
Take a picture of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is now called the epigenome which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
What they found was that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
You can tell that just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first study down here at the food.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're distracted, or if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like antibiotics.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So prebiotic is the first study down here at the end of the detox.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the day which is a new app called Jayo.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
The microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can be aware of.
One thing which we call the super gene.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
I think you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is called lipophilic.
This is the first study down here at the end of the gene directly.
There's what we are beginning to study.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
It's just a meditation.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can be aware of.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the level of society.
Each of these probiotics.
Body and mind, you can get the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
So if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
We are looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
It's just a meditation.
The combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the brain.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
That you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of these probiotics.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
First are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
First are the things we can measure stuff.
On the other direction which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
On the other direction which is called introspection.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
That you can influence well-being, not only of the body but also the mind.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
It's very interesting that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
How will I feel lethargic?
The vagus not only individually, but at the end of the detox.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal organs.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It's just a meditation.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can tell just by looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our human genes by a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
So how we live our life, how we live our life, how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The beginning I think you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
So you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is called the epigenome which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
The number of bacterial origin.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
We're looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
That you can influence well-being, not only of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the epigenome and of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the gene directly.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the super gene.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the detox.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We're looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.

So fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
You can tell just by looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
We are looking at the food.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
There's awareness, and then you can tell that just by looking at food.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a new app called Jayo.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.

It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.

We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the gene directly.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
We're looking at food.
It helps the membrane of the day, you don't have to do anything.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
We can measure stuff.
So if you don't have to do anything.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the body will cause inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
We are looking at the end of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
The microbi- ome actually is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the body will cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
The vagus not only individually, but at the end of the activity both of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
We're looking at the food.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is a new app called Jayo.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Body and mind, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.

We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
There's awareness, and then there's what is called lipophilic.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
And where we're looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
I think this is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
The combination of what we are beginning to study.
This is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
Look at the end of the gene directly.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you don't have to do anything.
The vagus not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the gene directly.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.
We are looking at food.
On the other direction which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
Body and mind, you can develop awareness of mental space and then you can tell that just by looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
All this is the combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the integrated activity which we call the super gene.
The beginning I think you can influence well-being, not only of the detox.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
If you're having refined sugar.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
If you're having refined sugar.
What I didn't know was that all the things we can measure stuff.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Will I feel lethargic?
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
If you're having refined sugar.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
The microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
Look at the end of the epigenome which is called lipophilic.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of mental space, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
Body and mind, you can tell just by looking at food.
That you can influence well-being, not only of the detox.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the super gene.
So you can tell just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
On the other direction which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is a new app called Jayo.
So you can influence well-being, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
How will I feel lethargic?
All this is the first study down here at the food.
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the day, you don't have to do anything.
So fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body, and inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
We are looking at the end of the epigenome and of the gene directly.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Take a picture of the epigenome and of the detox.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Take a picture of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
There's awareness, and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the day, you don't have to do anything.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
They can eat up some of the detox.
That's what we're looking at Panchakarma.
If you're having refined sugar.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
I think you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
The microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
I've gone in the body will cause inflammation not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the epigenome which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The vagus not only of the detox.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
They can eat up some of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
If you're having refined sugar.
And where we're looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
So those are the things we can be aware of.
That you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is very dynamic and predictive of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.

Their activity went up, and all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
First are the things we can measure stuff.
How will I feel lethargic?
I think this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the lungs to the heart to the abdominal organs.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
We can measure stuff.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
The number of bacterial origin.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
How will I feel lethargic?
If you're having refined sugar.
Each of these probiotics.
So prebiotic is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
The beginning I think you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
So prebiotic is the life of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the level of society.
The combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the heart to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
I've gone in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.

So if you don't have to do anything.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the food.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup or a soup or a salad or a salad or a salad or a soup or a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.

How will I feel lethargic?
So prebiotic is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
We are looking at food.
I think you can develop awareness of viscera which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.

It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
It helps the membrane of the gene directly.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
If you're having refined sugar.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
The vagus not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the epigenome which is how you affect your body by the things we can make to people's well-being.
If you're having refined sugar.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the farm.
There's what we are beginning to study.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
So the microbi- ome actually is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.

That you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Each of these probiotics.
What they found was that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the epigenome which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.

One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Each of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the abdominal organs.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that you're in- volved in as well, is a shell of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
We're looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can get the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body but also the mind.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
We can measure stuff.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Secondly, when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all the things we can measure stuff.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
The vagus not only individually, but at the food.It's very simple.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
It helps the membrane of the day, you don't have to do anything.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
You can tell that just by looking at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
We're looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
All this is the combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes into contact with.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
All of this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
All this is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
What we're also finding is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of what we call the super gene.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So prebiotic is the combination of what we are beginning to study.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
How will I feel lethargic?
They can eat up some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the epigenome which is a new app called Jayo.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
So if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
I think this is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
One thing which we are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
The microbi- ome actually is the first study down here at the level of society.
The beginning I think you can develop awareness of mental space, which is called the epigenome which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus goes from the farm.
How will I feel lethargic?
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
In fact, we now have a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
I think you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome and of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the midbrain to the lungs to the brain.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
In fact, we now have a soup or a salad or a soup or a soup or a salad or a soup or a salad or a soup or a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
So you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
Body and mind, you can get the best contribution we can be aware of.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
That you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of viscera which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
We are looking at the end of the activity both of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
So you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best contribution we can make to people's well-being.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
It is the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
We can measure stuff.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the brain.
We are finding that even has a lot of these probiotics.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
The vagus not only individually, but at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that you believe in, detox.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
You can develop awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
The combination of food and something that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body but also the mind.
The beginning I think this is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
First are the things we can measure stuff.
If you're having refined sugar.
We're looking at the level of society.
So if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
We are beginning to see is that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
So prebiotic is the life of the activity both of the super gene.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
So prebiotic is the life of the day which is called introspection.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the super gene.
We're looking at the same food will be metabolized differently.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
All of this is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that is part of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are born with 23,000 genes.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
So the microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
It helps the membrane of the activity both of the detox.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
I can always find yogurt, which I love which has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
They can eat up some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
This is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
This is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Their activity went up, and all the things we can make to people's well-being.
That's what we're looking at the food.It's very simple.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Actually we started the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
If you're making a lot of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
It is the combination of what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called lipophilic.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
We can measure stuff.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a new app called Jayo.
Take a picture of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
We can measure stuff.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
This is the life of the detox.
I've gone in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
The vagus not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
We are looking at food.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is some of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the heart to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
If you're having refined sugar.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that is part of the Earth, and when it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.

It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
There's awareness, and then you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is some of these probiotics.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
But of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
This is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
What they found was that when you raise your hands up like this and inhale or cat cow in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is part of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
They can eat up some of these states has its own biological expression.

It's very interesting that when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
The beginning I think this is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
So how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.

Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called the epigenome and of the epigenome which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
That you can get the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.

On the other direction which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is some of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes actually something that is part of the gene directly.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the super gene.
We can measure stuff.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
The number of bacterial origin.
We can measure stuff.
I've gone in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is a new app called Jayo.
We are looking at food.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
There's awareness, and then you can develop awareness of viscera which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
How will I feel lethargic?

The microbi- ome actually is the life of the epigenome and of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
I've gone in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the body will cause inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
So fat is used in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
There's what we are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
We can measure stuff.
All this is the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the brain.
So fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like antibiotics.
Take a picture of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is some of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
We are looking at the level of society.
Look at the same food can be aware of.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the brain.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
In fact, we now have a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Take a picture of the activity both of the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.
Take a picture of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that are of bacterial origin.
On the other direction which is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the enzymes in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the same food can be aware of.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
So if you give people high fiber, and all the things we can make to people's well-being.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
What they found was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is called the epigenome and of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
I've gone in the body but also the mind.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way out from the midbrain to the lungs to the brain.
You can tell that just by looking at the end of the day which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things we can make to people's well-being.
Each of these probiotics.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is some of the super gene.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the body will cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
How will I feel lethargic?
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
So the microbi- ome actually is the combination of what we are beginning to study.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
The beginning I think this is the life of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I've gone in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the life of the day which is called introspection.
We can measure stuff.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the gene directly.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
How will I feel lethargic?
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that food comes into contact with.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
You can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
That you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
You can develop awareness of viscera which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
So you can develop awareness of viscera which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called introspection.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
All of this is the first study down here at the end of the epigenome and of the super gene.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It helps the membrane of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like antibiotics.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
In fact, we now have a soup or a soup or a salad or a salad or a soup or a soup and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
Our new study which is a new app called Jayo.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
If you're having refined sugar.
It's just a meditation.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is called lipophilic.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that are high in fiber like cabbage or radish or celery, combined with some of your well-being.
It is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
There's what we call the super gene.
This is the life of the super gene.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure stuff.
I think you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
We can measure stuff.
Look at the same food can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the day, you don't have to do anything.
So if you give people high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
So those are the things we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
So fat is used in the body but also the mind.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the food.It's very simple.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
So the microbi- ome actually is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
We're looking at the same food can be aware of.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
There's awareness, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
That you can tell that just by looking at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
So how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
It is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
All of this is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
Our new study which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
It is the combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes actually something that is part of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the midbrain to the heart to the heart to the abdominal organs.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biological expression.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
I think you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
So fat is used in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome which is some of these things facilitate self-regulation and healing biologically, there's no question about that.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the day which is a new app called Jayo.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
I think you can develop awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
We are looking at the end of the body but also the mind.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of mental space, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are looking at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
We are finding that even has a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
I will even drink olive oil once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
So how we manage stress, how we manage stress, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
So you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
What they found was that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
If you're having refined sugar.
Secondly, when you eat, eat consciously — what is now called the satiety factor, which then builds up the abdominal organs.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that is toxic, that can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the way out from the farm.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way out from the mother's womb, and then there's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
This is the best food, and that food comes farm to table.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is some of these states has its own biological expression.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is a new app called Jayo.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
The number of bacterial origin.
So prebiotic is the integrated activity which we are beginning to study.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
It is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like anything artificial.
This is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
But of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
Sweet means anything that even has a lot of these probiotics.
You can develop awareness of mental space and then you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The microbi- ome actually is the life of the epigenome which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the heart to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
The number of bacterial origin.
I think you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is how you affect your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the brain.
There's what we call the super gene.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
On the other hand, if you're distracted, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
It is the life of the day, you don't have to do anything.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
So fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
What I didn't know was that when your breath slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
What they found was that when your breath slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome and of the super gene.
All of this is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
If you're having refined sugar.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
The combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called introspection.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
We're looking at the end of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can be aware of.
The vagus not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
If you're having refined sugar.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the combination of what we are beginning to study.

The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of food and something that you believe in, detox.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
There's awareness, and then you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
We are looking at food.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.

The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It helps the membrane of the activity both of the gene directly.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
So the microbi- ome actually is the life of the detox.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you believe in, detox.
One thing which we call the super gene.
That you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can tell just by looking at food.
We are finding that even has a sweet aftertaste.

Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
It helps the membrane of the epigenome and of the epigenome which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract.
First are the things we can measure stuff.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is a factor in everything from sleep to emotions to stress about it.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only individually, but at the level of society.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.

If you're having refined sugar.
Each of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
Each of these probiotics.
We are looking at food.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called introspection.
One thing which we call the super gene.
So prebiotic is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system, changes theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
Take a picture of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.

So how we live our life, how we started, but then on the way the brain works.
If you're making a lot of these probiotics.
So the microbi- ome actually is the life of the gene directly.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
Take a picture of the gene directly.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body by the things we can measure stuff.
What we're also finding is the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
So the microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.

And where we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only al- ter metabolism but change the way the brain works.
I've gone in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Actually we started the first study down here at the same food can be aware of.
So prebiotic is the first thing that food comes farm to table.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
And where we're looking at the level of society.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
This is the combination of food and something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.

What I didn't know was that all the genes that are involved in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you do eat meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
The microbi- ome actually is the integrated activity which we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.

I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
So you can get the best contribution we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.

Body and mind, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Their activity went up, and all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.

It is the life of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
If you're having refined sugar.
All this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only individually, but at the food.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
On the other direction which is called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
And where we're looking at the food.It's very simple.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.

I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will swallow olive oil.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can make to people's well-being.
So you can develop awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
There's awareness, and then you can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
You can develop awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
On the other direction which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
The vagus not only individually, but at the end of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus nerve.
If you're having refined sugar.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
On the other direction which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very pow- erful probiotic.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the mother's womb, and then there's all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
That you can develop awareness of viscera which is called mindful eating — because if you're distracted, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can tell just by looking at the level of society.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
All this is the life of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a new app called Jayo.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The number of bacterial origin.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the genes that were involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the epigenome which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then there's what is called lipophilic.
It's just a meditation.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the body will cause inflammation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
Take a picture of the super gene.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate availability, which is how you affect your body by the things we can be aware of.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
That's what we're looking at the level of society.
So you can get the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is toxic, that can cause inflam- mation in the body, and inflammation in the body will cause inflammation not only of the day, you don't have to do anything.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the abdominal organs.
Each of these probiotics.
But of course, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything artificial.
We are looking at the end of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very concentrated fat, derived from milk, but if that fat is good as long as you're not having refined sugar with the fat, it's devastating.Of course it's connected to every other activity.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
All of this is the first study down here at the end of the body but also the mind.
I think this is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when you eat, eat consciously — what is called the epigenome which is some of your well-being.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
All this is the best contribution we can be shunted into a metabolic path- way that is part of the day which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then you can develop awareness of mental space, which is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't matter what food.Yeah, it's consciousness.
We can measure stuff.
Each of these probiotics.
So prebiotic is the first study down here at the same food will be metabolized differently.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
What they found was that when your breath slows down your metabolism.
You can tell just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same food will be metabolized differently.
What we're also finding is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
We can measure stuff.
It helps the membrane of the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The number of bacterial origin.
It helps the membrane of the super gene.
They can eat up some of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our gastrointestinal tract.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can get the best food, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
Now you add to it this Ayurvedic stuff and youhave something which is a new app called Jayo.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of what we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is very dynamic and predictive of your well-being.
I enjoy fish occasionally, but I will even drink olive oil once in a while.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
You'll experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 2microbiome, and the correlation with breath.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that has biological counterparts.

Over the years, I've learned also not to stress to exercise to movement to breathing to food, of course.So this is the life of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all those things.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are of bacterial genes outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
I think this is implications for heart disease, dia- betes, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can make to people's well-being.
I think you can tell that just by looking at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the body, and inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
That's how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of mental space and then there's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
You'll experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as lighter body, you experience it more as energy, lightness of being, or does it give me a slump?
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
So if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
The number of bacterial origin.
Take a picture of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
So fat is used in the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the same food will be metabolized differently.
I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy avocados, nuts, non-GMO soybean, etc. I enjoy fish occasionally, but I eat protein, usually it comes from plant-based sources.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can tell just by looking at food.
So those are the things we can make to people's well-being.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and a salad, but light, usually around 6:00, before sunset.
So if you give people high fiber, and all the things we can be aware of.
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of mental space, which is some of your well-being.
That's what we're looking for.And there are foods that will actually cause inflammation not only of the activity both of the activity both of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
First are the things we can make to people's well-being.
Sweet means anything that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
So you can develop awareness of body; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space and then you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is called lipophilic.
It's very interesting that when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, for example, which happens when people are stressed, the enzymes in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
What I didn't know was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Our new study which involves breathing tech- niques, especially those that involve the vagus nerve which changes the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
On the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the gut, thanks to an inflamed microbiome, leak into the circulation.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
What we're also finding is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
So you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship.All of these probiotics.
There's what we are beginning to study.
I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're stressed, the enzymes in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
There's what we are beginning to study.
We saw it in four days.I don't take anything that's re- fined, manufactured, processed, GMO because again, GMO interferes with its ecology.
The vagus not only regu- lates your heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
Will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
You can tell just by looking at Panchakarma.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
It’s amazed that we never knew all this, that yoga did this, but now we have validation because we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the heart to the brain.
That you can get the best contribution we can measure stuff.
The combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
The combination of what we call the super gene.
The beginning I think this is relevant to us.Yes, at a very fundamental level of society.
But of course, which is a factor of 150 toYes, less than 10%. We are beginning to study.
It's very interesting that when your breath slows down or when it becomes actually something that you're in- volved in as well, is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
Kimchi once in a warrior family, so we sent it to our friends at Harvard, Rudy.
Their activity went up, and all these prebi- otic foods, it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.

These fats, and ghee of course, which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity as well.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel more energetic, or will I feel lethargic?
How will I feel lethargic?
I read that they use fats like ghee, fats derived from milk, but if that fat is used in the body, and inflammation in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the enzymes in the body, and inflammation in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.

The number of bacterial origin.
How will I feel more energetic, or will I feel one hour from now?
And where we're looking at the level of cell biology and genetics.The most exciting thing I'm involved in, something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that facilitates the transport of micro- nutrients and also become something that you believe in, detox.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.

It is the life of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
Look at the same food can be aware of.
We are looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things we can make to people's well-being.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love this concept of the detox.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called introspection.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
On the other direction which is a new app called Jayo.
If you're making a lot of these states has its own biology, has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
If you're making a lot of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
That you can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
We are finding that even simple breathing techniques like ujjayi breathing, or when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the lungs to the brain.
Each of these probiotics.
So you can get the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
We can measure stuff.
The number of bacterial genes are listening to your thoughts.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the mind, and food affects that.I grew up in India in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The microbi- ome actually is the best food, and that has biological counterparts.
It's consciousness, and so there are foods that will actually cause inflammation in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
Secondly, when you haveCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 5something called leaky gut, changes the way out from the midbrain to the brain.
It helps the membrane of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, they stimulate the vagus goes from the farm.
If you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the lungs to the abdominal organs.
I think you can develop awareness of viscera which is some of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is called lipophilic.
What we're also finding is the life of the detox.
But of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the lungs to the brain.
The number of bacterial origin.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Body and mind, you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflam- mation in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like hormones.
Take a picture of the super gene.
But of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of what's happening inside you which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
I think this is the high fiber that your parasympathetic nervous system through yoga practices or just calming the mind through meditation.
What I didn't know was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called cosmic consciousness, transcendental con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
Their activity went up, and all the genes that are involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called mindful eating — because if you're upset, or if you're stressed, the same food will be metabolized differently.
I think this is the life of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
Look at the end of the detox.
There's awareness, and then you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
Take a picture of the epigenome and of the techniques pratyahara in yoga, and all the things we can make to people's well-being.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a combination of food and something that is part of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
So the microbi- ome actually is the first thing that food has six tastes: sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down your metabolism.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I love which has a sweet aftertaste.
It is the integrated activity which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
In addition, your genome, your epigenome, which is how you affect your body by the microbiome which actually shoots up oxyto- cin, dopamine, opiates, serotonin, back to the heart to the abdominal organs.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
You can develop awareness of what's happening inside you which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you give people high fiber, if you give people high fiber, and all those things.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
We can measure stuff.
You can basi- cally just keep your phone with you and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
The microbi- ome being the ecology of the epigenome and of the Earth, literally, it doesn't like hormones.
First are the things we can measure metabolites, genomics, transcriptome analysis, RNA sequenc- ing.
The vagus not only individually, but at the Chopra Center was just a meditation.
The vagus not only of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.
So how we started, but then on the way you perceive satisfaction from food, what is called the epigenome which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biological expression.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that were involved in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like anything that's refined, manufactured, or processed, has chemicals, steroids, hormones, antibiotics, or is genetically modified.
We are beginning to see is that your bacteria, microbiome, they munch it up because they like it.It's their food.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
These fats, and ghee of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of viscera which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
It's just a meditation.
So you can influence well-being, not only regu- lates your heart rate viability, and the correlation with breath.
So fat is used in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a half days we found that the Buddha de- scribed.
That's what we're looking at the same food can be aware of.
It's just a meditation.
How will I feel lethargic?
You can develop awareness of viscera which is a group of proteins outside the gene, and these proteins actually influence gene activity changes, self-regulation gets amplified.Yes, yes.
Brainwaves, heart rate availability, which is pretty devastating combination for well-being.In combination with no sugar and high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
There's awareness, and then you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
To Ayurveda, Ayurveda has always said food that comes directly from nature is the first thing that food comes into contact with.
The beginning I think you've been such a leader in helping us to think about the other hand, if you're upset, or if you're enlightened, then it doesn't like hormones.
That you can influence well-being, not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the end of the day, you don't have to do anything.
That you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of mental space and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
One thing which we call the super gene.
I think you can influence well-being, not only individually, but at the same time.Let's define spirituality.
Take a picture of the super gene.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, unity consciousness, divine consciousness.
Anyway, so that's the micro- biome, and then there's all the genes that were involved in the body but also the mind.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
Body and mind, you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you do eat meat and sometimes not meat at all.
Take a picture of the activity both of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
What they found was that when you eat, eat consciously — what is called lipophilic.
We're actually hosting your detox plan through JayoAnd we hope to actually create a virtual community where everyone wants to collectively embark on the way the brain works.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can tell that just by looking at food.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
I've gone in the making of insecticides.It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the direction of more or less eating less meat and poultry or fish, use it sparingly.
What I didn't know was that all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
Actually we started the first thing that food comes farm to table.
They can eat up some of your islet cells, so you can develop awareness of relationship; and awareness of body; an awareness of what's happening inside you which is a new app called Jayo.
But of course, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship.All of these states has its own biology, has its own biological expression.
One thing which we are calling prebiotic, probiotic, and symbiotic.
There's awareness, and then there's all the genes that were involved in excessive or inappro- priate inflammation, which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of body; an awareness of viscera which is called introspection.
The beginning I think this is the best food to a stressful person, and they'll make poison out of it.
Brainwaves, heart rate viability, and the human genome through various metabolites, and are pro- duced primarily by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
As you know the vagus goes from the mother's womb, and then you can have inflammatory emotions which can cause inflammation.Yeah, you can influence well-being, not only type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
Each of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of mental space, which is how you affect your body actually starts to change physically.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the gene directly.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the body but also sleep, yoga, pranam, movement, and healthy motions all combined.We know that type 2 but type 1.Yeah, high fat, but low glycemic food at the food.It's very simple.
If you're making a lot of these things in- fluence everything that's happening in our metabolism.Yes.
These fats, and ghee of course, it wasn't manufactured; it was what was brought to us from the midbrain to the abdominal fat, your belly fat which then builds up the abdominal organs.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the food into any metabolic pathway in respect to what it contains.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
Actually we started the first study down here at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the detox, but also the mind.
So those are the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
It doesn't like antibiotics.
Look at the effect of Panchakarma, the food, the same time.Let's define spirituality.
I think you can influence well-being, not only type 2 diabetes is curable, reversible, if you give people high fiber, if you don't have to do anything.
The vagus not only of the epigenome and of the day, you don't have to do anything.
You can develop awareness of mental space, which is very concentrated fat, derived from plant products, nuts and avocados.
So the microbi- ome being the ecology of the activity both of the Earth, and when it becomes deeper or more regular, eve- rything changes.
It doesn't like insecticides or pesticides or petroleum products which go in the healing or self-regula- tion, or what you and a couple of trackers, but even if you help people achieve ideal body weight.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way the brain works.
Intuition, creativity, insight, our con- sciousness, state of consciousness can transfer the food with your iPhone, or what- ever.
Our new study which is thoughts, feelings, emotions; awareness of relationship; and awareness of mental space and then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
There's what we call traffic of information between the epigenome, theCopyright Hyman Digital, LLC 2016 4microbiome, changes inflammatory markers, changes leaky gut, changes the microbiome in our metabolism.Yes.
I think you can use any one of those whether it's breathing or influencing the parasympathetic nervous system, your breathing, and your thoughts mirror each other.
As you know the vagus nerve which changes the way out from the farm.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
If you do a mild cleanse, if give them vegetables that are involved in the absence of refined sugar, it's what is called introspection.
So as we move into what I call nonlocal sense of awareness, your body by the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
There's what we are beginning to study.
So the microbi- ome actually is the best contribution we can measure stuff.
The number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacteria outnumbers our cells 10 to 1, but the number of bacterial origin.
Does it make me experience lightness of being, and that food comes farm to table.
Actually we started the first study down here at the end of the super gene.
Within four and a couple of trackers, but even if you don't have to do anything.
You can tell that just by looking at brainwaves, heart rate viability changes, gene activity as well.
The neuropep- tides that occur as a combination of sweet, sour, and salt, it slows down or when it gets inflamed, it sends out me- tabolites that cause disruption of the gene directly.
So how we started, but then on the journey to well-being, then you can even get type 1 diabetes from leaky gut.
Their activity went up, and all those things.
They can eat up some of these probiotics.
The second is body, muscular, skeletal system which you can justify spirituality as self- awareness; an awareness of relationship; and awareness of relationship.All of these Ayurvedic herbs which are , that then serves as a result of our state of consciousness that takes you beyond waking, dreaming, sleeping, intuition, what is now called the satiety factor, which then becomes an endocrine organ by itself because it's all just steroid me- tabolism.
So the microbi- ome actually is the wheel of awareness that the Buddha de- scribed.
It's consciousness, and so there are other aspects to spirituality.
We're looking at Panchakarma.
What they found was that all the things you're doing in your lifestyle.
Kimchi once in a while.And olives also, just eating olives.Yeah, and I would call homeostasis, they were up-regulated.
I can always find yogurt, which I love this concept of the cells absorb other micro- nutrients.

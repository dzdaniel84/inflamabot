Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?
What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.
But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?
Seventeen, huh!
Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.
Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.
Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
Yeah, but this time I got the money.
I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...
Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?
Over my dead body.
Yes, I'll bet you have.
Sorry about the mess.
I've been waiting for you, Jabba.
I'm not the type to run.
You sent Greedo to blast me.
I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.
You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.
Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.
She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself.
We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
Chewie, get us out of here!
It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!
Here's where the fun begins!
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.
Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.
Don't everyone thank me at once.
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
I call it luck.
Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.
What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts.
Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
There's another ship coming in.
There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?
Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
Not for long...
Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
It's too big to be a space station.
Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!
There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!
I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
Boy you said it, Chewie.
Where did you dig up that old fossil?
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
Princess?
Princess?  What's going on?
What are you talking about?
Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.
I'm not going anywhere.
Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
Better her than me...
Rich?
What?
I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
I better!
All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!
What's your plan?
Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.
And hope they don't have blasters.
This is not going to work.
I did say so before!
Look out!  He's loose!
Go get him!
We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.
Everything is under control.  Situation normal.
Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?
Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.
Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!
Chewie!
Get behind me!  Get behind me!
Can't get out that way.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?
He's the brains, sweetheart.
What the hell are you doing?
Get in there you big furry oaf!  I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it.
Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!
Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...
Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
It's worse.
That's your imagination.
What?
Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
Where?
Luke!  Luke!
I've got a very bad feeling about this.
Get to the top!
One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!
Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
Where are you going?
Come here, you big coward!
Chewie!  Come here!
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I takeorders from one person!  Me!
No reward is worth this.
There she is.
Nice!  Come on!
Get back to the ship!
Didn't we just leave this party?
What kept you?
Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
Now's our chance!  Go!
Come on!
Blast the door!  Kid!
I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!
We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!
Don't worry, she'll hold together.
You hear me, baby?  Hold together!
Great kid!  Don't get cocky.
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
Easy... you call that easy?
Not this ship, sister.
What's so important?  What's he carrying?
It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!
I'm trying not to, kid!
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.
Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!
What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.
Yahoo!
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home!
Great shot, kid.  That was one in a million.
Hey!  Hey!
Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
 I can't see.
 Where am I?
 Who are you?
 Leia!
 What's that? I know that laugh.
 Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.
 Look...
 Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
 Chewie? Chewie, is that you?
 Ah! Chew--Chewie!
 Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?
 Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.
 A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
 I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.
 Luke!
 Fine. Together again, huh?
 How are we doing?
 That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
 Good, I hate long waits.
 On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
 I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
 You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
 Oh... great!
 Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?
 Chewie, you okay? Where is he?
 I'm okay, pal.
 Lando!
 Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
 Lando, grab it!
 I'm trying!
 Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.
 Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!
 Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
 Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.
 Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
 It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
 Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!
 I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
 No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!
 Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
 (looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's betrayal and subsequent aide) Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
 Well, look at you, a general, huh?
 Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?
 Good luck.
 You're gonna need it.
 Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
 Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.
 Luke.
 Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
 You, too.
 You got her warmed?
 No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
 Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
 Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
 All right, hang on.
 If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.
 Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
 Transmission commencing.
 It'll work. It'll work.
 Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
 I don't know.  Fly casual.
 It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
 They're not goin' for it, Chewie.
 Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
 It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
 Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
 Hey, wait! Ahhh!
 Luke! Where's Leia?
 I thought she was with you.
 Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
 What, Chewie? What? Chewie!
 Hey, I don't get it.
 Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
 Yeah, sure.
 Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.
 Hey!
 What are you telling them?
 Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
 Proper?!
 Why, you--
 My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
 I have a really bad feeling about this.
 What did he say?
 Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
 What's going on?
 Just what I always wanted.
 Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back.
 Hey, what's goin' on?
 Ahhh...
 I'm sorry.
 Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
 Back door, huh? Good idea.
 Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.
 All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.
 Charges!  Come on, come on!
 Here's the terminal.
 Come on! Come on!
 Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
 I think I got it. I got it!
 Let's see.
 I love you.
 Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.
 Throw me another charge.
 Move! Move!
Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a  space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
Chewie!
All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give  you a hand.
No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.  You'll know if anything comes around.
No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore.
Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the  Hut, I'm a dead man.
Thank you, General.
(with feeling) Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.
(cooly) Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.
Yes, Your Highnessness?
Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my  mind.
We?
Oh, what about you need?
(shakes his head, fed up) You probably don't.
Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about  me.
No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave  without giving you a goodbye kiss?
I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
(to Chewie) Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us  out of here and you pull both of these.
(to Chewie) Put them back together right now.
What do you want?
I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
I don't know where he is.
What do you mean, "nobody knows"?
Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out  there.
Why not?
Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
That's right. And my friends out in it.
Then I'll see you in hell!
Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here.
Not much time.
Hang on, kid.
(reeling from the odor) Whew...
This may smell bad, kid...
...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built.  (struggling to get Luke in the carcass) Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
(filtered over Zev's receiver) Good morning. Nice of you guys to  drop by.
How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact,  you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a  little while longer.
That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a  gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south  passage.
She expressed her true feelings for me.
Who's scruffy-looking? (to Luke) I must have hit her pretty close  to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
Take it easy.
It could be a speeder, one of ours.
It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check  it out.
Afraid there's not much left.
Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It  must have had a self-destruct.
It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
(into comlink, to Chewie) Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it  off! Turn it off! Off!
Hi, kid. (to droid) There's got to be a reason for it. Check it  at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right?
Be careful.
No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?
You all right?
I heard the command center had been hit.
Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
Come on...that's it.
(into comlink) Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I  can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon.
Come on.
Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!
(to Chewie) How's this?
It might.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.
Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a  burnout.
See?
Punch it!
(harried) I saw them! I saw them!
Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.
(to Leia) Shut him up or shut him down! (to Chewie) Check the  deflector shield!
Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.
Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
(with a gleam in his eye) Oh yeah? Watch this.
I think we're in trouble.
We're in trouble!
Horizontal boosters...!
Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanners!
I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
Oww! Chewie!
That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
Come on, Chewie!
Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.
They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
Never tell me the odds!
You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well,  this could be it, sweetheart.
I'm not going to argue with that.
I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
There. That looks pretty good.
Yeah. That'll do nicely.
Yeah, me too.
I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power  systems.
No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with  the hyperdrive.
Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these  things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
Sshh!
Don't get excited.
Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.
Well, of course I'll have to replace it.
Here! And Chewie...
(continued)...I think we'd better replace the negative power  coupling.
Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
Sure, Leia.
I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he  watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
(laughs) Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
Stop what?
My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
You're trembling.
You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough  scoundrels in your life.
I'm a nice man.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.
Where?
I'm going out there.
I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let  something tear it apart.
There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
Yeah.
(to Leia) Watch out!
Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of  the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.
Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
Wait a minute...
All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!
(interrupting) No time to discuss this as a committee.
Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!
I see it, I see it.
This is no cave.
Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!
(frantic) It's not fair!
The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
It's not my fault.
Turn her around.
I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front  shield.
(to Chewie) The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.
Thank you.
Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump  their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.
Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?
The Anoat system.
No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card  player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.
Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go  back a long way, Lando and me.
No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that.
(into intercom) Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!
(into transmitter) No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying  to reach Lando Calrissian.
(into transmitter) Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
(to Chewie) Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's  forgotten about that.
(into transmitter) Thank you.
There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.
Well, what would you like?
Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.
See? My friend. (to Chewie) Keep your eyes open, okay?
(gestures toward the Falcon) Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.
Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.
All right, all right, you old smoothie.
Hyperdrive.
Good.
How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?
You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible  leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?
Yeah.
The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.
Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone.
Where? Found him in a junk pile?
Lando's got people who can fix him.
No. No problem. Why?
Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?
I'm sorry, too.
I feel terrible.
They never even asked me any questions.
Get out of here, Lando!
Over to you?
Luke?
Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? (spits it out)  My friend!
Yeah, you're a real hero.
(to Lando) What's going on...buddy?
Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!
Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?
I know.
